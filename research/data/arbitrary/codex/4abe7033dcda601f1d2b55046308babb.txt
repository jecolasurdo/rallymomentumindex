These taxes are levied by both the federal government and some state governments. Although the terms "estate tax" and "inheritance tax" are sometimes used synonymously, there are differences between the two. Generally speaking, an estate tax is applied to the value of a decedent's property and is paid from the estate before distribution to any heirs. Conversely, an inheritance tax is paid by the heir or heirs of a decedent's assets.[1][2][3] Federal estate tax The Internal Revenue Service defines the estate tax as "a tax on your right to transfer property at your death." An estate consists of a deceased individual's property, which can include real estate, cash, business interests, stocks and other assets. As of 2015, only estates with a taxable value of more than $5.43 million were subject to the tax. This exemption threshold changes according to inflation; see the table below. The maximum rate of estate tax is 40 percent.[2][4][5] The estate tax was first levied by the federal government in 1916. The maximum estate tax rate peaked at 77 percent between 1941 and 1976. Between 1977 and 2012, the rate declined to 35 percent. In 2013, the rate increased to 40 percent.

March 18, 2014 Debate The estate tax is a source of considerable controversy. In 2009, Representative Jared Polis (D-Colorado) argued in favor of the estate tax. "Without the estate tax," he said, "you in effect have an aristocracy of the wealthy, which means you pass down the ability to command resources of the nation based on heredity rather than merit. America is and should be a meritocracy." Chye-Ching Huang and Nathaniel Frentz, in a 2013 report for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, praised the tax as "an important source of federal revenue for nearly a century" that "limits, to a modest degree, the large tax breaks that extremely wealth households get on their wealth as it grows, which can otherwise go completely untaxed."[11] Meanwhile, critics contend that estate and inheritance taxes are tantamount to "death taxes." In 2009, Representative Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) said, "After someone dies, and someone comes in and steals from them, we consider that reprehensible, that's just despicable. But when the government comes in—because we have the power to pass laws and legalize theft—it's OK." The Tax Foundation has argued that "estate taxes discourage entrepreneurship and lead to large tax compliance costs."[11][12] Recent news This section links to a Google news search for the term "Estate + tax" Inheritance and estate tax policy news feed See also Taxes on the ballot Personal income tax Sales tax Corporate income tax External links Tax Policy Center Federation of Tax Administrators Tax Foundation Footnotes ↑ About.com, "What's the Difference Between an Estate Tax and an Inheritance Tax?" accessed October 16, 2014 ↑ 2.0 2.1 Internal Revenue Service, "Estate Tax," updated September 29, 2014 ↑ 3.0 3.1 3.2 3.3 3.4 Tax Foundation, "State Estate and Inheritance Taxes in 2014," May 28, 2014 ↑ Forbes, "After the Fiscal Cliff Deal: Estate and Gift Tax Explained," January 1, 2013 ↑ Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, "Myths and Realities About the Estate Tax," revised August 29, 2013 ↑ Tax Foundation, "Federal Estate and Gift Tax Rates, Exemptions, and Exclusions, 1916-2014," February 4, 2014 ↑ About.com, "What's the Difference Between an Estate Tax and an Inheritance Tax?" accessed October 16, 2014 ↑ Internal Revenue Service, "Estate Tax," updated September 29, 2014 ↑ 9.0 9.1 9.2 Tax Foundation, "Facts and Figures, 2015," accessed October 6, 2015 ↑ New Jersey Division of Taxation, "General Information: Inheritance and Estate Tax," accessed October 16, 2014 ↑ 11.0 11.1 NPR, "The Estate Tax Explained: Who It Hits and Doesn't," December 4, 2009 ↑ Tax Foundation, "Estate and Gift Taxes," accessed October 16, 2014 v • eBudget policyBudget backgroundGovernment budgets • Cost of state transparency websites • State budget issues • Public employee salaries • Public pensions • States with spending online • Glossary of state budget terms • Total state expenditures • State spending by function as a percent of total expendituresState budget and finance pagesAlabama • Alaska • Arizona • Arkansas • California • Colorado • Connecticut • Delaware • Florida • Georgia • Hawaii • Idaho • Illinois • Indiana • Iowa • Kansas • Kentucky • Louisiana • Maine • Maryland • Massachusetts • Michigan • Minnesota • Mississippi • Missouri • Montana • Nebraska • Nevada • New Hampshire • New Jersey • New Mexico • New York • North Carolina • North Dakota • Ohio • Oklahoma • Oregon • Pennsylvania • Rhode Island • South Carolina • South Dakota • Tennessee • Texas • Utah • Vermont • Virginia • Washington • West Virginia • Wisconsin • WyomingTax policy backgroundPersonal income tax • Sales tax • Corporate income tax • Property tax • Excise taxes • Estate and inheritance taxes • Capital gains taxState tax policy pagesAlabama • Alaska • Arizona • Arkansas • California • Colorado • Connecticut • Delaware • Florida • Georgia • Hawaii • Idaho • Illinois • Indiana • Iowa • Kansas • Kentucky • Louisiana • Maine • Maryland • Massachusetts • Michigan • Minnesota • Mississippi • Missouri • Montana • Nebraska • Nevada • New Hampshire • New Jersey • New Mexico • New York • North Carolina • North Dakota • Ohio • Oklahoma • Oregon • Pennsylvania • Rhode Island • South Carolina • South Dakota • Tennessee • Texas • Utah • Vermont • Virginia • Washington • West Virginia • Wisconsin • Wyoming v • eBallotpediaAboutOverview • What people are saying • Support Ballotpedia • Contact • Contribute • Job opportunitiesExecutive: Leslie Graves, President • Gwen Beattie, Chief Operating Officer • Geoff Pallay, Editor-in-Chief Communications: Kristen Vonasek • Kayla Harris • Megan Brown • Mary Dunne • Sarah Groat • Heidi Jung External Relations: Alison Prange • Sara Key • Sarah Rosier • Kari Berger Operations: Meghann Olshefski • Lauren Dixon • Kelly Rindfleisch • Sara Antel • Sara Horton Contributors: Scott Rasmussen EditorialDaniel Anderson, Managing Editor • Cory Eucalitto, Managing Editor • Dave Beaudoin, News Editor • Josh Altic, Project Director • Mandy Gillip, Project Director • Christopher Nelson, Project Director • Jerrick Adams • Victoria Antram • Emily Aubert • Jaclyn Beran • Marielle Bricker • Ryan Byrne • Kelly Caldwell • Kate Carsella • Sarah Doyel • Gregory Ennis • Megan Feeney • Tyler King • Doug Kronaizl • Amee LaTour • Jace Lington • David Luchs • Brittony Maag • Steph MacGillivary • Jimmy McAllister • Jackie Mitchell • Elisabeth Moore • Samuel Postell • Paul Rader • Sara Reynolds • Luke Seeley • Abbey Smith • Caitlin Styrsky • Janie Valentine • Joel Williams • Samuel WonacottTechMatt Latourelle, Tech Manager • Ryan Burch • Seth Campbell • Michael Cella • Margaret Kearney • Margaret Koenig • Tom Reitz Retrieved from "https://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php?title=Estate_and_inheritance_taxes&oldid=7052447" Category: Budget policy terms Ballotpedia features 311,385 encyclopedic articles written and curated by our professional staff of editors, writers, and researchers.
