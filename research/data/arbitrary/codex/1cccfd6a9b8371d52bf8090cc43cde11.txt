(iStock) The state of Texas provides financial aid for undocumented students. New York State does not. What's that about? That's the embarrassing question I have been asking New York State elected officials since 2001, when then-Texas Republican Gov. Rick Perry signed legislation granting undocumented students state financial aid. Advertisement Their answer: "It's the Republicans who control the Senate. They won't budge." Yet every year, Albany enacts other bipartisan legislation. With a Democratic majority coming in both the state Assembly and Senate in 2019, and Gov. Cuomo having expressed his support, there's no excuse: Pass the Dream Act! Advertisement The New York Dream Act would allow undocumented students to qualify for financial aid, including loans and tuition grants. New York would be following the path of California, New Mexico, Minnesota, Texas and Washington. Recent New York State proposals would grant financial aid to students who graduated from a New York State high school after having attended at least two years or who received a New York State High School Equivalency Diploma. State Controller Thomas DiNapoli estimates this would cost about $27 million. Most Read Charlize Theron to 'incredibly overweight' Steven Seagal: You can't fight, 'F--k you!' Connecticut brothers in car chased down black teens on bikes while hurling racial slurs, police say Steve Bing, Elizabeth Hurley's ex-boyfriend, died from multiple blunt trauma: coroner The New York State Dream Act does not provide legal status, employment authorization or other benefits to undocumented students. Only the federal government can do that. Federal Dream Act legislation that would have provided undocumented youth a path to citizenship failed, thanks partly to five Senate Democrats voting no. What will New York's Dreamers do with their education? Most will work and pay taxes. Some have employment authorization through the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Others can work as independent contractors. Get a law license, and hey, you can be an independent contractor. Get a degree in computer science, and you bet you'll be a busy consultant. Some New York Dreamers will need to wait for federal legislation, a real possibility in the coming two years, to provide them work permission. I've taught for more than 30 years at the City University of New York, so I know that undocumented students can perform at high levels given the chance. To borrow a slogan from the United Negro College Fund, a mind is a terrible thing to waste. Allan Wernick is an attorney and director of the City University of New York's Citizenship Now! project.
