Environment Jun 24, 2020 0 5 Indonesia's Mt Merapi erupts, spewing ash 6 km high Indonesia's Mount Merapi, one of the world's most active volcanoes, erupted twice on Sunday, sending clouds of grey ash 6,000 metres into the sky, the country's geological agency said. Environment Jun 21, 2020 8 4393 Researchers use CARC systems to understand volcano shapes According to the United States Geological Survey, Earth is home to about 1,500 potentially active volcanoes, with new volcanoes forming about once a week. Volcanic eruptions can be highly unpredictable and pose a major threat ... Earth Sciences Jun 10, 2020 0 7 How drones can monitor explosive volcanoes Due to the difficult accessibility and the high risk of collapse or explosion, the imaging of active volcanoes has so far been a great challenge in volcanology.

Earth Sciences May 14, 2020 0 302 Scientists reveal mineralogical and geochemical characteristics of hydrocarbon-bleached rocks in mud volcanoes Mud volcanoes are geological structures formed by the eruption of semi-liquid and gas-enriched mud breccia on the Earth's surface or on the sea floor. The migration processes of geofluids around mud volcanoes could provide ... Earth Sciences May 11, 2020 0 11 How speech recognition techniques are helping to predict volcanoes' behaviour Dr. Luciano Zuccarello grew up in the shadow of Mount Etna, an active volcano on the Italian island of Sicily. Farms and orchards ring the lower slopes of the volcano, where the fertile soil is ideal for agriculture. But ... Earth Sciences May 05, 2020 0 5 Scientists find evidence of how platinum metals form under 60 million-year-old Scottish volcano Research carried out by scientists at Keele University, the University of Manchester and University College Dublin has shed new light on how precious metals are concentrated in igneous rocks. Earth Sciences May 01, 2020 0 658 New study takes the pulse of a sleeping supervolcano Under the volcanoes in the Andes where Chile, Argentina and Bolivia meet, there is a gigantic reservoir of molten magma. For several million years, it has been there without fully solidifying or causing a supervolcanic eruption. ... Earth Sciences Apr 23, 2020 0 153 page 1 from 82 « » Volcano A volcano is an opening, or rupture, in a planet's surface or crust, which allows hot, molten rock, ash, and gases to escape from below the surface. Volcanic activity involving the extrusion of rock tends to form mountains or features like mountains over a period of time. The word volcano is derived from the name of Vulcano island off Sicily. In turn, it was named after Vulcan, the Roman god of fire.Volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging. A mid-oceanic ridge, for example the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has examples of volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates pulling apart; the Pacific Ring of Fire has examples of volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates coming together. By contrast, volcanoes are usually not created where two tectonic plates slide past one another. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the Earth's crust (called "non-hotspot intraplate volcanism"), such as in the African Rift Valley, the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field and the Rio Grande Rift in North America and the European Rhine Graben with its Eifel volcanoes.Volcanoes can be caused by mantle plumes. These so-called hotspots, for example at Hawaii, can occur far from plate boundaries. Hotspot volcanoes are also found elsewhere in the solar system, especially on rocky planets and moons.
