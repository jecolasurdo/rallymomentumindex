Last night, Governor Lawrence Hogan issued an executive order indefinitely prohibiting large gatherings and events within the state of Maryland. Based on this order and all other relevant information gathered, the National Board of Trustees convened an emergency meeting this afternoon to make the difficult decision to cancel the 2020 National Leadership Conference. Please know that this decision was not made lightly, and we realize the disappointment that this decision will cause for so many who worked hard throughout the membership year to earn the opportunity to attend NLC. However, there is no greater importance than the health and safety of our student and advisor members.BPA In the NewsLeading Through Challenging TimesI will say it so you don't have to. What is going on right now in the world is nothing short of unusual and unprecedented; it's something straight out of a movie you want to end quickly. Just think, a few months ago COVID-19 wasn't even a part of normal conversation. Now, schools are closing or going to e-learning environments, conferences are being canceled, social distancing is a common phrase, and a whole lot of uncertainty of what the next few weeks and months will bring are a part of our everyday thinking and conversation. So let me ask you this. How are you doing? How are you handling it all? How do you feel? How is your family? How are your BPA team members? Take a moment or so and reflect on those questions. Are you feeling a loss of control? Are you feeling disappointed? Are you missing regular interaction with those closest to you?BPA In the News2020 State Leadership Conference Results/Finalist Below you'll find the finalist from SLC this past week.

So what do puzzles have to do with leadership in action? During my recent reflections, puzzles have been emerging as a symbol of teamwork, connection, and cooperation.

Let's break it down a little further: BPA In the NewsWhy Conflict is Inevitable #LeadershipInActionThe way we handle conflict can either stop progress and communication all together, or create deeper and more meaningful collaboration.
