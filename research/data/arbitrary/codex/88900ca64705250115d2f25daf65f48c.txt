UC Davis Medical Center was listed in the 2019 Honor Roll for Maternity Care, as recognized by the California Health & Human Services Dept, the Hospital Quality Institute, and Cal Hospital Compare based on our low C-section rate of under 23.9% for low risk, first birth deliveries. Everyone in our department understands that we care for a particularly high-risk population with high acuity and complexity, yet our quality measurements are better than most of our peers. I think this speaks to our overall approach to best practices for our patients that results in much better than expected despite the adverse population characteristics. Congratulations to everyone!
