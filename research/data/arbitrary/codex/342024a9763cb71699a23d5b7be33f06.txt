In her role as a member of the senior leadership, she served as the Vice Provost for Academic Initiatives, and as the Executive Vice Provost and an Officer of the University. In her research, Beilock focuses specifically on success in math and science for women and girls, and how performance anxiety can either be exacerbated, or alleviated by teachers, parents and peers. She explores the brain and body factors that influence skill learning and performance, as well as how simple psychological strategies can be used to ensure success in high-stakes situations ranging from test-taking and public speaking to athletics. She has published more than 100 papers and has received funding from the National Science Foundation (including a CAREER award), the Department of Education, and several foundations. Beilock won the 2017 Troland Award from the National Academy of Sciences. In addition, she is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Psychological Association, and a member of the National Academy of Kinesiology. Early in her career, she received awards from the Association for Psychological Science, American Psychological Foundation, the Psychonomic Society, and the Society of Experimental Psychologists.President Beilock is the author of two books that have been published in more than a dozen languages—the critically acclaimed Choke: What the Secrets of the Brain Reveal about Getting It Right When You Have To (2010) and How the Body Knows Its Mind: The Surprising Power of the Physical Environment to Influence How You Think and Feel (2015). Her recent TED talk has been viewed more than 1.5 million times. President Beilock earned her Bachelor of Science in cognitive science from the University of California, San Diego, and doctorates of philosophy in both kinesiology and psychology from Michigan State University.

Since its founding in 2010, the WCCHR has conducted 426 evaluations for 364 individuals from 66 different countries and has trained 676 students in how to conduct such evaluations. In addition to serving individuals directly, the WCCHR is helping to revolutionize how asylum cases are managed in the United States by calling attention to the important, yet often unrecognized, role of medical professionals. The WCCHR is the first medical student-run asylum clinic in the United States. It has been lauded as "a model for the future” by the medical asylum community.Weill Cornell Community ClinicThe primary mission of the Weill Cornell Community Clinic (WCCC) is to provide high quality primary health care services to uninsured New Yorkers through consultation, treatment, referral services, preventative care and screening for permanent health care insurance programs. Concurrently, the WCCC also aims to educate medical students on the medical and social issues surrounding the care of underserved populations in order to foster a sense of civic responsibility and humanitarianism. Founded in 2003, the WCCC is a student-run free clinic of Weill Cornell Medical College and provides primary care, women's and mental health services for over 150 patients a year during over 350 patient visits. Camp PhoenixCamp Phoenix was founded in 2000 by a WCMC alum, Paul Mullan, M.D. (Class of 2004) to enrich the lives of pediatric burn survivors and their siblings by creating camping experiences that are memorable, exciting, fun, and physically safe, all while training future physicians in the art of compassionate and empathetic care. Within this environment, campers build a support community based on sharing their stories and overcoming their disabilities. As their motto states, it's "a place where kids can spread their wings and fly”.Health Professions Recruitment and Exposure ProgramThe Health Professions Recruitment and Exposure Program was created to increase the enrollment rate of students who are underrepresented in medicine and support the next generation of healthcare leaders. It was founded in 1989 by Dr. Daniel Laroche ('92) when he was a student here at Weill Cornell and has since expanded to medical schools across the country. Theintensive 10-week program facilitates mentorship between local high school students and current medical students while providing an opportunity for mentees to interact with physicians and other healthcare professionals. Through scientific lectures, research assignments, college essays, resume workshops, PBL sessions, and basic anatomy lessons, students are exposed to the intimacies of medicine while developing skills critical to their success beyond the conclusion of the program. Mentees who have produced extraordinary research papers and college essays are granted special recognition and book scholarships at a graduation ceremony.

On behalf of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, congratulations!! Student Awarded HHMI Medical Grant and Doris Duke Research Mentorship Award Description: Angel M. Charles was recently awarded both the Howard Hughes Medical Institute Medical Fellowship and a Doris Duke Research Mentorship Award. The long-term aim of her project is to develop a targeted immunotherapy that can treat HPV induced cancers with high specificity and minimal adverse effects. She is working in the laboratory of David Scheinberg at MSKCC that developed a T-cell receptor mimic (TCRm) monoclonal antibody (mAb) which is specific for a Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) peptide (protein fragment) bound to a Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) complex, which presents antigens to T cells. The TCRm binds the HPV-peptide/HLA complex and induces killing of virus-infected cells. The short-term aim of her project is to identify and evaluate potential off-target binding of the TCRm to normal peptides in human tissue. On behalf of the Office of Diversity and Inclusion, Congratulations!! Movie Viewing: Agents of Change Description: On March 20th, Dr. Elizabeth Wilson-Anstey hosted a showing of the movie documentary "Agents of Change". WCM alumni, Dr. John Mitchell '73 and Dr. Frank Douglas '77 (and Alumni Association Special Achievement Awardee) shared their experiences as students on the Cornell University campus during the pivotal civil rights era of the late 1960's depicted in the film. Dr. Wilson-Anstey moderated a discussion that included the alumni's perspectives on changes and challenges in promoting diverse and inclusive educational curricula and learning environments through the lens of lessons learned in the intervening decades. Health Professions Recruitment and Exposure (HPREP) 2018 Graduation Ceremony Description: On Friday, March 16, 2018, eighty-six high school students successfully completed the Health Professions Recruitment Exposure (HPREP) program. Hani Li, 1st year medical student, gave welcoming remarks to open the ceremony. The keynote speech was given by Dr. Elizabeth Wilson-Anstey, Assistant Dean of Diversity and Student Life. The Health Professions Recruitment and Exposure Program (HPREP) was created in 1989 by Dr. Daniel Laroche ('92). He developed the program while he was a medical student to increase the enrollment of student groups that are underrepresented in medicine. After a presentation by Dr. Laroche regarding HPREP at a Student National Medical Association (SNMA) conference, the SNMA adopted the program at other medical schools. HPREP is now a national program. At WCM, HPREP is a ten-week program held on Friday afternoons beginning in January. This year five HPREP coordinators: Aretina Leung, Han Li, Dianna Mejia, Anthony Mok, and Samir Touhamy II, organized the program. The students heard from many physicians and other health professionals regarding their career paths. In addition, HPREP students worked in small groups with medical students learning how to write personal statements, resumes, and research papers. Students were also educated on the medical school application process and how to apply for financial aid.Congratulations to the 2018 HPREP Graduates!
