These can include red meat, seafood and the consumption of alcohol.READ MORE: 'Some days it's debilitating': When joint pain takes over your life"Like any chemistry concept, if there is too much of something in a given quantity of liquid, it becomes too concentrated,” Abibsi said.Gout has been seen as a "man's disease” or one that only affects people who drink too much alcohol or consume too much meat. But it is also on the rise, experts add.Dr. Debra Dye-Torrington, who works in the rheumatology department at Scarborough Health Network in Scarborough, Ont., added this reflects changes in demographic factors."These changes affect both modifiable and non-modifiable factors,” she said."Examples of modifiable rise factors are obesity, alcohol consumption and diet. Examples of non-modifiable factors are increasing longevity and age-associated diseases.” Trending Stories Can I go to another province?

"Gout occurs more often in men, primarily because women tend to have lower uric acid levels,” the site noted."After menopause, however, women's uric acid levels approach those of men. Men are also more likely to develop gout earlier — usually between the ages of 30 and 50 — whereas women generally develop signs and symptoms after menopause.”Apart from diets rich in meat, fish and alcohol, Youn said fructose-sweetened beverages could also be a risk factor.Treatment options for goutDye-Torrington says non-pharmacological treatment options for acute gout includes icing the joint, while pharmacological treatments include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, colchicine, and intra-articular corticosteroids."Long-term treatment requires lowering the uric acid level with pills. Allopurinol is the pill most commonly used,” she said.Youn says seeing a foot specialist is also often needed.READ MORE: Anti-gravity treadmill relieves pain for patients: 'like walking on the moon'"A chiropodist may prescribe a custom foot orthotic with a rigid extension to reduce mobility in the affected joint or a shoe with a rocker bottom sole. An orthopedic surgeon may also need to aspirate or flush the joint to help relieve pain.”Abibsi says prevention is the best treatment — stay hydrated and healthy."Avoid excessive alcohol consumption,” Dye-Torrington continued. "Wine is safer than beers... avoid sugary drinks.”Day-to-day management of gout involves staying educated on the topic, Youn said. This can help reduce the risk of recurring attacks.It is important to monitor your symptoms as well as keep track of your diet, Abibsi continues. A nutritionist can also be helpful in creating meal plans.arti.patel@globalnews.caFollow @ArtiPatel Story continues below advertisement © 2019 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc.
