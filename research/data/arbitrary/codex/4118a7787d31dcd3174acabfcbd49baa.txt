Baseball league for all is looking to expand into WNY: 'We all just want a fair chance in society' News by: Kelsey Anderson Posted: Jun 24, 2020 / 04:28 PM EDT / Updated: Jun 24, 2020 / 04:28 PM EDT BUFFALO/NIAGARA, N.Y. (WIVB) — An organization that gives all adults a chance to play baseball is looking to expand its league into WNY. Taylor Duncan, 24, started Alternative Baseball near his home in Atlanta. That league is now growing rapidly across the country. "Growing up I dealt with a lot of speech issues, sensory issues and anxiety issues,” Duncan said. Duncan has autism, and growing up many of his peers decided he didn't belong on the same playing field as them. "I was encouraged to quit instead of encouraged to stay in there like everybody else.” He realized if he wanted to play the sport he loved, he'd have to created a league of his own. So in 2016, he started Alternative Baseball. According to Duncan, after high school, there are very few social programs for adults with disabilities. So, his league is for anyone older than 15. The organization not only helps players gain athletic skills, but it helps them create relationship and communication skills that will carry them past the diamond. "Catching a pop-fly... 'I got it, I got it, I got it,'... you have to communicate that to your team members.” To come up with an original team, he recruited from Craigslist and different Facebook groups. There were seven players who joined the league in 2016. Today, there are teams in 14 states across the country. And he hopes to expand into the Buffalo/Niagara region within the next year, giving people in WNY a chance to be included and supported. And also giving them the chance to finally show what they're made of. "We all just want a fair chance in society,” Duncan said. "We all want the equal opportunity to contribute and feel like we are being productive members of society... we want to be supported. But we can't do that if people have preconceived perceptions of what we're capable of and don't give us the opportunity to show people what we can do.” Duncan is looking for a coach/manager who can get the program off the ground here in WNY. It's a volunteer position. He also needs other volunteer coaches, and of course he needs players. For more information on how to get involved, click here. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.

Share this story More News Stories House Democrats pass sweeping police overhaul, Senate stalls by By LISA MASCARO AP Congressional Correspondent / Jun 25, 2020 WASHINGTON (AP) — House Democrats approved a far-reaching police overhaul Thursday, a vote heavy with emotion and symbolism as a divided Congress struggles to address the global outcry over the deaths of George Floyd and other Black Americans. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi gathered with members of the Congressional Black Caucus on the Capitol steps, challenging opponents not to allow the deaths to have been in vain or the outpouring of public support for changes to go unmatched. But the collapse of a Senate Republican bill leaves final legislation in doubt.

"I'm open to anything that helps Main Street, if we need to help them going forward," Rep. Greg Pence, (R-Ind.), told Nexstar Media. "I think it's a little premature in my state – the economy's doing great, we're flat on the virus – so I think we have to go slow, let's not get ahead of ourselves on a second stimulus package."

For his return Thursday to the battleground state, he was reminded how much has changed since January. The Republican president visited conservative, rural Wisconsin for a private tour of a shipyard far from Milwaukee, where coronavirus restrictions now prevent large rallies.
