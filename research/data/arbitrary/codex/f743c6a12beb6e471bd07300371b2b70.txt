On Wednesday's episode of General Hospital, Hayden left Port Charles while leaving her daughter Violet behind. It was an emotional goodbye between Hayden and those she cares for and visa versa but she really doesn't have a choice. With everything that has been going on with Nikolas Cassadine (Marcus Coloma) and Valentin Cassadine (James Patrick Stuart), Hayden is being threatened and staying in Port Charles just isn't safe at this time. Hayden just introduced Violet to her father, Dr. Finn and his fiance Anna Devane (Finola Hughes), and although it's breaking her heart to leave Violet, it's best she stays behind with her dad. It's a tough scenario on and off screen for the characters and actors alike. This is the second time Budig has exited from General Hospital. The door has been left open for her return, we can hold on to that and hope she returns sooner rather than later.

I want to thank all those @generalhospitalabc fans that show up everyday and are passionate about this show and our characters. I will miss my friend..for those like him are hard to come by..but I know our paths will cross again.
