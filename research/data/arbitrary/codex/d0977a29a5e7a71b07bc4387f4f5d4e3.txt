Lord Patten said the row over the Rhodes statue should not overshadow a focus on addressing inequality. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: "I stood along Nelson Mandela at a conference in Westminster Hall with Tony Blair and Bill Clinton in 2003 at which he said how strongly he supported the trust. "He set up... something called the Mandela-Rhodes Trust to help heal the divisions. "For all the problems associated with Cecil Rhodes' history, if it was alright for Mandela, then I have to say it's pretty well alright with me." Demonstrators took to the streets of Oxford on Tuesday, which you can see in the video below, to voice their opposition to the Rhodes statue. After activists tore down the monument to slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol on Sunday (see the video below), there have been calls by anti-racism campaigners for more statues in the UK to be removed, including the Rhodes tribute. Lord Patten said: "It should be taken seriously and there should be a proper and engaged argument. "I hope it isn't an argument about symbols and so on, which doesn't avoid an argument about far more fundamental issues which touch on Black Lives Matter, like education, like public housing, like public health." Lord Patten said the fate of the statue was a matter for Oriel College, and claimed there was "hypocrisy" among critics of the statue who had also benefited from Rhodes scholarships. "For me there is a bit of hypocrisy ... in Oxford taking money for 100 scholars a year, about a fifth of them from Africa, to come to Oxford, and then saying we want to throw the Rhodes statue ... in the Thames." People should be able to examine history without a feeling of 'self loathing' Business minister Nadhim Zahawi said people should be able to examine the country's history without a feeling of "self loathing" and decisions on statues should be taken democratically. "We need to have a proper, in-depth, debate, and it's right to do that, about our history," he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. "I'd like to see, you know, a way for us to move forward, warts and all, looking at this but also not forgetting and not self-loathing, don't forget some of the good things we've done." He said the priority should be on improving the opportunities for people from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) backgrounds. "That, to me would be a priority, versus a debate just on statues. Statues are important, they are symbols, we understand our history, warts and all, but I think we ultimately will decide how our political leaders do deal with this in the ballot box." Protests in the UK, in pictures Here are the best selection of photographs from the protests across the UK in the past days. UK Black Lives Matter protests, in pictures 'Stand up to racists,' says Met's Assistant Commissioner The Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner has urged his fellow officers to "stand up to racists" as anti-racism demonstrations continue across the country. Neil Basu wrote in a letter to his UK colleagues that it was "time to stand up - stand up to racists, to inequality and injustice". He said he "had my doubts about the organisation" when he joined the force in 1992, adding it was "particularly hard" to be from a minority ethnic background at the time of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry. "The damning findings and recommendations of that inquiry are etched into the fabric of UK policing's history - but the positive outcomes, hard won, are real," he wrote. "Our progress since has not been smooth, either, with missteps and setbacks along the way. "Each setback is heart-breaking and despite how far we have come we must confront the fact that with many of our communities - especially the black community - we still have a long way to go." It had been a "particularly shattering week" for BAME colleagues amid protests and violence sparked by US black man George Floyd's death at the hands of a white police officer, Mr Basu said. "The way George died represented the worst of policing and will forever be a totemic image of racial injustice in America," he said. "His last words ... 'I can't breathe' ... have become an anthem, and I desperately hope this is their moment for change." It comes months after Mr Basu said officers should strive during the coronavirus pandemic to preserve the public's confidence through persuasion and education, rather than automatic enforcement. Writing in The Telegraph on March 30, he called for the public to show understanding toward police and for officers to "police by consent" as they were compelled to use powers he "never imagined a British police officer would be asked to use". He echoed that call in his letter to officers, writing that it was important to recognise the differences in British and US policing. "We are not the same, because unlike America we overwhelmingly police by consent, and not by force," he wrote. Mr Basu urged his colleagues to recognise demonstrators were angry not just at police brutality but also with institutional racism. "So let us view the legitimate anger, manifesting itself now in different ways, with nuance and care," he said. "Yes, some people behave badly; yes, a tiny minority are no more than criminal opportunists, but the overwhelming majority are showing solidarity with George and what his death represents. "They have a point. We need to listen to our communities, and our people, and focus on what we in the UK can do better." PM rules out end to stop and search Boris Johnson has defended the use of police stop-and-search powers, amid claims they are disproportionately used against black people. During a series of exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions (which you can rewatch in full below), Mr Johnson insisted he understood the "strong and legitimate" feelings of people in the UK over the "appalling" death in the US of George Floyd. But following clashes at some Black Lives Matter demonstrations, he insisted it was essential to keep the streets safe and to "back our police". He also refused to condemn the response of US President Donald Trump to the death of Mr Floyd while a white policeman knelt on his neck, praising the US as a "bastion of peace and freedom". Mr Johnson sought to highlight his record as mayor of London, saying he was "very proud" of initiatives which had been introduced to promote black, Asian and minority ethnic officers in the Metropolitan Police. However he was challenged by acting Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey, who said black people were 47 times more likely than white people to be stopped by police using stop and search powers. "On too many occasions, stop and search seems to mean being black is enough to be suspected of being a criminal," he said. Mr Johnson acknowledged the powers should be used "sensitively and in accordance with the law" but said they were an important tool in combating violent crime. "What has been happening in London with knife crime has been completely unacceptable," he said. "I do believe that stop and search, amongst many other things, can be a very important utensil in fighting knife crime."It does work. It worked for us when I was running London and it must work now. It is not the whole answer but it is part of the mix." Colston statue to be fished out of water and put in museum A commission of historians and other experts will research and share Bristol's "true history" following the removal of the Edward Colston statue by protesters, the city's council has said. Marvin Rees, the mayor of Bristol, said: "The events over the last few days have really highlighted that as a city we all have very different understandings of our past. "The only way we can work together on our future is by learning the truth of our beginnings, embracing the facts, and sharing those stories with others. This is why this commission is so important." Mr Rees said the members of the commission would be announced at a later date. He confirmed that the statue would be retrieved from the harbour and exhibited in one of the city's museums alongside Black Lives Matter placards from Sunday's protest. Any decision on the future of the plinth on which the statue stood will be "decided democratically through consultation", the city council added.
