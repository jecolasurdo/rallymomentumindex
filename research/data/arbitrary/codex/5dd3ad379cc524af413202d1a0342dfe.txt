It is dedicated to creating awareness and discussion about mental health in minority communities, in order to increase their access to mental health care and treatment.

Here are 10 facts about Minority Mental Health to get you thinking. Read and then join the discussion on social media using #MMHM.

To help ease the change, we have put together 15 Autumn Wellness Tips to get you ready for the colder months and keep your mental (and physical!) health in check. Start taking a Vitamin D supplement. We get most of our Vitamin D from the sun, so our intake decreases when the weather is colder since we spend most of our time inside during the fall/winter seasons. If you find you are not getting outside much, a Vitamin D supplement can boost your mood and immune system! Take some time to yourself. Autumn and winter are the Earth's way of telling us to slow down. Start a journal or track your moods to get more in touch with how your feeling. Get your flu shot and yearly check-up. Self explanatory! No one likes sniffling and aching and sneezing and coughing getting in the way of life. Yuck. You don't want to be Sicky Vicky Boost your immune system. You can do this by drinking plenty of water, washing your hands often to prevent sickness, and eating nutritious foods. Get yourself ready for Daylight Savings Time. Go to bed earlier when you can, especially the week before the clocks change. Longer periods of darkness = longer periods of sleep! Don't forget to change any manual clocks (like an alarm clock!) Make some plans for the cold months. In the winter, we tend to hibernate if we don't have things to keep us busy. Moisturize your skin. Harsh temperatures can make your skin dry. Also, you still should be wearing sunscreen. Buy in-season food. Beets, broccoli, cabbage, eggplant, kale, pumpkin, broths, roasted squash, roots and sautéed dark leafy greens are all great choices. I don't think Pumpkin Spice Lattes count, but you do you. Stay active! It can be easy to just sit around all the time, but it's important to get in some movement throughout the day. Raking leaves or shoveling snow counts! Wear layers and protect your body from the dropping temperature. Make sure you have gloves, a scarf, ear muffs, a winter coat, warm socks, and snow boots! Don't forget a snowsuit! Do some "spring cleaning” in the fall. Clean out your closet, organize that back room, and rid yourself of things you don't need. Prepare your home for possible extreme weather conditions. Do you have a shovel and/or snow blower? Do your flashlights have batteries? Is your heat working okay? Get some books to read and shows to watch. Who doesn't want to sit by the fire on chilly winter nights and read a good book or binge-watch some Netflix? Just don't get too engrossed... make sure to shower and change your clothes! Keep a schedule. The cold months can seem to drag on and push us into isolation. Stay on track by scheduling time in your day to do things you like to do. Be kind to yourself. The holidays can cause weight gain, the shorter days can cause low mood, and the flu season can cause sickness. Listen to your body and give it what it needs, and don't beat yourself up!

Pretty cool, huh? Start shopping at smile.amazon.com and help us change the world! Now that August is officially upon us, it's time for new and returning college students to get ready to head back to campus. And with that comes the endless back-to-school shopping trips so you can stock up on everything you need — textbooks, snacks, school supplies, dorm decorations and so much more. But do you have anything on that list to help support your mental health? Take a look at these nine items, all of which have helped me better take care of my mental (and physical) health during the school year. Sleep It's one of the most important (and most frequently sacrificed) aspects of mental health maintenance — especially for college students. I'm a big fan of sleep (and good sleep at that). Here are some of the products I've used to help myself get eight full hours of shut-eye each night: A White Noise Sound Machine ($49.89) This handy gadget is perfect for anyone who has a noisy roommate. It has a built-in fan that re-creates the sound of rushing air, creating "white noise” and effectively blocking out noise on a broad range of frequencies. Fraternity brothers chanting outside? No problem. Roommate stumbling in after a fun night out? You can't hear them, you're fast asleep.

The new school year was always something I looked forward to, as it symbolized a fresh start, a clean slate. It was like a reset button, presenting a brand new set of opportunities and possibilities. Much to my surprise, six years after graduating from college, I find myself back in the same situation as I prepare for my first year in graduate school, and much to my delight, I am filled with the same enthusiasm. Don't misunderstand, there is also a healthy dose of anxiety mixed in — I have had to quit my job, leave my boyfriend and friends, and move to an unfamiliar city — but when it comes to new beginnings, fear and excitement often seem to be two sides of the same coin.

To help you get ready for the semester, we've put together five tips that you can use to have a great start to the year. Relax. Starting a new year back at school can be exciting, but with new classes, adjusting to campus life and getting back on a schedule, the new school year can also bring stress. When your brain gets stress, your body experiences stress as well. It begins to release chemicals like adrenaline and cortisol, which really takes a toll on your body. Make sure to carve out some quiet time in your day–read, go for a walk, listen to a guided meditation–do something that makes you slow down and calms your mind. Your body will thank you.
