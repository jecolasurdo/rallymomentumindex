The government order came shortly after a district judge denied a request to halt construction on the pipeline.The Dakota Access Pipeline is opposed by over 200 Native American groups who fear its impact on waterways.The $3.7bn (£2.8bn) project will pass through four states, close to lands that are sacred to members of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. But only minutes earlier, US District Judge James Boasberg ruled that a decision to fast-track the pipeline project was not illegal.The federal government then in effect overruled the judge, calling on the Texas-based company to voluntarily halt construction temporarily within 20 miles of Lake Oahe, which is considered sacred to the regional native tribes.

The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe called the Obama administration's intervention "stunning"."Our hearts are full, this an historic day for the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and for tribes across the nation," tribal chairman Dave Archambault II said. "Our voices have been heard."Dakota Access, which is building the pipeline, declined to comment.

Over the Labor Day holiday weekend, violence briefly flared between private security forces and protesters who had come from across the United States and Canada.Six people were bitten by dogs, and 30 were pepper-sprayed, according to a tribal spokesman.
