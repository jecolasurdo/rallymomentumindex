"I attempted to keep the juveniles focused on me,” the officer said in the report. "I explained to the juveniles to stay calm and focus on me because they knew why I was there. I stressed that one of them could still be armed and I haven't dispelled that threat.”Once back-up arrived, the officer said he holstered his service weapon and began to help pat them down. None of the teens were armed, but when questioned about the gun they were in possession of, as seen in the video recorded at the gas station, one of the teens led police to where he had thrown it in the bushes."The handgun was located,” the officer stated in the report. "It was a BB gun, however, it appeared real. I stressed to the juveniles that carrying a real looking BB wasn't safe and very dangerous.”According to Lt. Cherie West, CCPD public information officer, the BB gun "closely resembled a live semi-automatic pistol.”West said police got in touch with each of the teens parents and spoke with them on scene before releasing them. No charges were filed against the teens."We want to remind our Clayton County citizens that we are committed to protecting and serving each and every one of our citizens through decades of established trust and effective communication,” West said in a release from the department.In an earlier social media post, police Chief Kevin Roberts said the department remains "committed to being transparent and accountable to the community.”In addition to photos of the BB gun, CCPD also release the two 911 called received and body cam video footage.

Chief Roberts and the local county authorities, you have a good officer and should stand behind him...he did nothing wrong and everything right in this case...do not give in to pressure from those on the anti-police bandwagon and from others who don't know the facts. We need good officers like this. Report Add Reply Welcome to the discussion. Please log in, or sign up for a new, free account to read or post comments. Log In Keep it Clean.
