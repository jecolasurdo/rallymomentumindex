Thanksgiving Tribune available Wednesday Local News Nov 24, 2019 Staff report WARREN — The tryptophan barely will be wearing off as area residents begin preparing for the holiday shopping season and all the local deals that will be available, as always, in the Tribune Chronicle's Thanksgiving Day edition. "We know the Thanksgiving edition of the Tribune Chronicle is a holiday tradition for readers who are getting ready to hit area retailers,” said Tribune Chronicle General Manager Ted Snyder. The Black Friday deals listed in advertisements and sales fliers make the Thanksgiving edition of the Tribune Chronicle the biggest newspaper of the year. And to make sure readers have enough time to digest all the deals — along with their Thanksgiving dinner — and to map out their Black Friday shopping plans, the Tribune Chronicle Thanksgiving Day edition will be available early again this year beginning Wednesday afternoon, chock full of all the holiday sales fliers. "The Thanksgiving edition is our largest newspaper of the year, with more than two dozen sales fliers and inserts being stuffed into the huge newspaper this year,” Snyder said. The Thanksgiving Day early bird edition newspaper will be available after 2 p.m. Wednesday at limited retail locations throughout the area. Of course, it also will be delivered to all home subscribers early Thursday morning and will be available at more than 250 local retail locations again Thursday morning. Retailers and advertisers who are scheduled to include inserts in this year's early bird and Thursday Thanksgiving Tribune Chronicle edition are: Best Buy; Big Lots; CVS Pharmacy; Dick's Sporting Goods; Five Below; GameStop; Home Depot; JCPenney; Kohl's; La-Z-boy Furniture; Levin Furniture; Lowe's; Macy's; Mattress Firm; Menards; Michaels; Ollie's Bargain Outlet; Rite Aid; Shoe Carnival; Staples; Target; Tractor Supply; Value City Furniture; Ulta Salon; Walgreens; and Walmart. Snyder suggests subscribing to the Tribune Chronicle in order to get your hands on all the fliers without having to leave your house on Thanksgiving Day or risk missing out if this high-demand edition of the newspaper is sold out early. "The best way to be guaranteed a copy of the Thanksgiving edition is to be a home subscriber, but if not, look for it at your favorite retail location,” Snyder said, adding that due to the popularity of the annual Thanksgiving edition, the Tribune Chronicle has increased the number of copies available, and staff will be actively restocking at retail locations. Despite the newspaper's large size, Snyder said the price has not increased from previous years. "The newspaper will be just as big as last year's holiday edition, and the price will remain at $1.50,” he said. "Many holiday shoppers plan their entire shopping experience around what they find in the Tribune Chronicle,” Snyder said. "We are pleased to be a part of that family tradition.” NEWSLETTER Today's breaking news and more in your inbox I'm interested in (please check all that apply) Daily Newsletter Breaking News Local News All-electric 'Endurance' pickup truck takes the stage Valley adds two COVID-19 deaths The Ohio Department of Health reported Wednesday more than 630 new COVID-19 cases, increasing the total from 46,127 ...
