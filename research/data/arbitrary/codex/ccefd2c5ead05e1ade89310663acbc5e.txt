Several reports have come in and almost all are positive. Consumer spending is up, revealing optimism and consumer confidence has been on a roll, spelling further confidence. The job reports came out at a whopping 261,000 new jobs and unemployment is the lowest in awhile. There's been some minor hiccups in inflation, but we can still expect a rise in rates soon. The Bank of England boosted rates for the first time in 10 years. The only problem I can name, a chronic one, is those out of the workforce as well as under-employed people, of which there are many. But that's another discussion altogether. For now, let's be happy for the good economic news.
