Compare gas credit cards for fair credit Earn attractive fuel credits with gas-station credit cards. Kevin Joey Chen Updated Jun 18, 2020. What changed? Fact checked Having a fair credit may limit your credit card options, but you'll still have access to credit card perks. For example, you can get valuable fuel credits with a cobranded gas card.We looked for cards with standout rewards on fuel that are accessible to consumers with fair credit. What's changed in 2020? The ExxonMobil™ Smart Card dropped off our list this year, as its signup bonus has diminished considerably. In its place, we awarded the Shell Fuel Rewards® Mastercard® with "best signup bonus.” While Discover's secured card can theoretically provide a higher rewards haul, we find that Shell's card has a more straightforward bonus that's still lucrative if used properly.

Check each card's base rewards rate — that is, the rate you'll earn without doing anything extra. Then check each card's bonus rewards — the rates you'll get for activities like meeting minimum spends.Rebates and cash back.A card may offer rebates or cash back as well. For gas-station cards like the Shell Fuel Rewards® Mastercard® and BP Visa Credit Card, you'll get these rewards back as statement credit.What is statement credit?Statement credit reduces the balance you owe on your credit card. If you apply a $100 statement credit to a $1,000 balance, for example, you now owe only $900.Signup bonus.Some cards offer impressive signup bonuses — typically in the form of large rebates on your initial fill-ups with your card. When considering a card, look at its terms to see if there's a signup bonus, and whether the bonus applies within a specific time period or simply for a certain number of fill-ups.Annual fee.Fair-credit gas cards typically have no annual fees. However, it's worth checking out a card's fee table to see if you'll have to pay.APR.Fair-credit gas cards usually have very high APRs — from around 25% to 30% variable. That said, avoid these cards if you'll carry a balance month to month. The interest can easily erase the rewards you earn.Compare gas credit cards for fair credit Sort by: Name Product Welcome offer Rewards Annual fee Filter values Credit One Bank® Unsecured Visa® with Cash Back Rewards N/A 1% cash back on all purchases or in categories based on Credit One Bank's discretion $0 to $99 Earn 1% cash back on all purchases or in categories based on Credit One Bank's discretion.
