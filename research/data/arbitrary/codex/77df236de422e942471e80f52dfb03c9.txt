For the Birds: Goldfinch populations seem down but OKSharon Sorenson, Special to the Courier & Press Published 6:00 a.m. CT June 21, 2020 CLOSECONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREIt's that time of year when feeder hosts ask, "Where are the goldfinches?"Be assured that goldfinch populations, estimated at 42 million, face no serious threat.While goldfinches wander the Tri-State year-round, they aren't necessarily the same goldfinches. As feeder hosts puzzle over the bright yellow birds' seeming summertime absence, here's the story.The fluctuating populations result when northern birds move through in fall, feeding heavily before traveling on. But many northern goldfinches find the Tri-State southerly enough and stay, boosting winter populations. Spring brings another influx, mobs emptying feeders on their way back north. Some of our winter residents join them on the return journey. Thus, as goldfinch numbers even out for the summer, depending on habitat and breeding territories, we now see the fewest goldfinches.Add to that the fact that goldfinches roam according to environmental conditions. They habitually don't nest in much of the southern one-third of the U.S., and climate change may be pushing them even farther north. So fewer may be staying in the Tri-State. Since goldfinches don't show strong nest-site fidelity, they allow natural food supplies to direct nesting location.But there's more. Unlike other birds, goldfinches are vegetarians. They don't eat bugs. They don't feed their babies bugs. Early, before plants produce ripened seed, goldfinches forage on sap, leaf and flower buds, flowers, moisture-rich leaves, and fruits — all abundant with this year's spring rains. They have little interest in feeder-seed offerings likely harvested at least a year ago.Goldfinches nest late. While experienced females breed in July, first-time moms start tending nests in early August. Female goldfinches, busy at homemaking chores, become a rare sight at feeders. So territorial behavior during breeding season affects bird populations at feeders, too.Still, there's another possible cause of feeder population decline: bad seed. Nyjer seed, sometimes called thistle seed, comes to us primarily from Ethiopia. Its oil-rich nutrition makes it the traditional winter favorite among goldfinches. But oil-rich also equates with easily spoiled. Any nyjer seed stored above about 80 degrees will turn rancid quickly. And rancid is hard to detect. Unlike buggy seed that has a webby appearance or even squirmy little bugs contaminating the seeds, rancid shows no outward change in appearance. But birds won't eat it.While maybe you've been diligent, storing the seed in climate-controlled conditions, it's possible it came to you from a warehouse without those conditions. Given summertime heat and humidity, we really don't know where or how -- or how long -- the seed has been stored, much less transported.So what to do? Buy a small amount of new seed from a vendor who sells seed by the truckload, guaranteeing rapid inventory turnover. Empty the old seed, wash the feeders (that's important), and try the new seed. If the old seed has turned rancid, birds will find the new seed in a matter of days, thus cluing you in to what's wrong.In addition, some experts suggest that, as goldfinches approach breeding season, the birds prefer something more substantial than tiny nyjer seed. They recommend offering instead black-oil sunflower seeds -- whole, chips or hearts. In my own yard, I see that preference playing out. While the freshly scrubbed and filled nyjer-seed feeder hangs unused, the sunflower chip feeder boasts good goldfinch traffic.So, no goldfinches now? Just wait until mid-October.For more information about birds and bird habitat, see Sharon Sorenson's books Birds in the Yard Month by Month and Planting Native to Attract Birds to Your Yard.
