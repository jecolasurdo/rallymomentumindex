He puts his knapsack onto the ground. A photo taken from across the street shows the knapsack at his feet. 2:45-2:49 Dzhokhar stays in front of the Forum for about four minutes, occasionally looking at his phone and appearing to take a picture with it. Approximately 30 seconds before the first explosion, he lifts the phone to his ear as if he is speaking, and keeps it there for 18 seconds. A few seconds after he finishes the call, the first explosion goes off. The crowd around him can be seen turning their heads east, toward the explosion. Dzhokhar glances to the east, and then calmly but rapidly walks west, away from the finish line.
