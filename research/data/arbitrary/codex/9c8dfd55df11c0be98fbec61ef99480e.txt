ISS Cancellation Request form available online If you submitted a request to ISS and your plans have changed, you can now submit our new Cancellation Request web form. Please indicate the type of request previously submitted and whether or not the request was already approved/processed. Temporary online travel signature request form now available ISS has launched a Temporary Online Travel Signatures request process and form. The new request form is 100% online and does not require students to submit their document in person. The U.S. government has announced during this COVID-19 period, digital I-20 forms with a scanned signature will be allowed and can be sent via email to a student's UW email account. Once the I-20 and travel signature has been processed, an ISS advisor will email you additional information and an attached PDF copy of your I-20 form. Reminder: travel signatures are not required to depart the U.S. They are required for re-entry only. You can leave the U.S. and then request ISS mail you a new I-20 that will include an updated travel signature. Travel signatures are valid for 1 year for enrolled students, and 6 months for alumni on OPT ISS advising & services online (in-person services suspended) ISS has transitioned all advising & services online. ISS advisors will process immigration requests, updates, and other student services remotely. We are currently experiencing a very high volume of emails and questions. Our responses may be delayed and we encourage you to review answers to commonly asked questions on this page and at UW Coronavirus Facts & Resources as well as Spring Quarter Facts and Information. The ISS staff is committed to providing you with uninterrupted advising, case processing, and information sessions as we transition to remote work. U.S. Government Updates June 22: Proclamation extending suspension of immigrants to the U.S. On June 22, the President signed a Proclamation that extends the suspension of entry to the U.S. of immigrants abroad seeking U.S. permanent residency (adjustment of status) and individuals who present a risk to the U.S. labor market due to COVID-19. This proclamation does not apply to F or J academic visas who will enter the U.S. for the purpose of study. J-1 academic exchange categories, and J-1 professor, research scholar, short-term scholar, and college or university students are excluded from this proclamation. This proclamation does not apply to F-1 students authorized for OPT. OPT was excluded from this proclamation and no changes have been made to the current OPT benefits. The proclamation suspends and limits entry through the end of December 2020 for immigrants abroad seeking permanent residency to the U.S. The proclamation also suspends entry to the U.S. of new H, J (non academic categories), and L visa categories through the end of December. This does not apply to immigrants or visa holders already in the U.S. under these visa categories or anyone abroad who already holds one of these valid visas. For individuals outside the U.S. who are applying for an immigrant visa for U.S. permanent residency (adjustment of status) or an H, J (non academic category), or L visa, consult an immigration attorney for advice and options. Where can I read SEVP and DOS guidance directly? Universities receive updates from the U.S. Student & Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) and the Department of State (DOS). The U.S. government also makes these updates available for the public. Department of Homeland Security – Study in the States: COVID-19 Resources Department of State guidance for J-1 students – Exchange Visitor Program Information on Coronavirus (COVID-19) Department of State temporarily suspends routine visa services at all U.S. Embassies and Consulates As of March 20, the U.S. Department of State announced they are temporarily suspending routine immigrant and non-immigrant visa appointments at all U.S. Embassies and Consulates. As resources allow, embassies and consulates will continue to provide emergency and mission critical visa services. They will resume routine visa services as soon as possible but are unable to provide a specific date at this time. If you need to travel outside the U.S. and will require a new visa before returning, we recommend you review the Embassy or Consulate's visa appointment information where you be traveling before you make final travel plans. You may want to reconsider your travel plans since we do not know how long this suspension will last. Social Security Administration has closed all offices to in person services As of March 17, SSA has suspended all face-to-face services at all Social Security offices. Review information and updates online at Social Security & Coronavirus or contact the local office to determine whether appointments are available. Proclamation on Coronavirus travel restrictions Which countries are impacted by the coronavirus travel restrictions to the U.S.? International Student Enrollment for Upcoming Quarters What is the status of summer quarter classes? The University announced on summer quarter 2020 classes that begin on the first day of summer quarter will be offered remotely and will not be held in-person. This applies to both A and full terms. The UW also announced most summer B term courses will also be offered remotely. Will fall quarter classes be online? The UW has created two task forces to develop plans for how we can safely return to in-person learning and how employees can safely return to in-person work once public health guidelines allow it. The Back to School and Back to Workplace task forces will post updates to their pages as soon as new information is available. The UW plans to be back this fall for in-person instruction and expects to provide specific details by early July. At this time, it is anticipated that autumn quarter will include both in-person and remote elements. The task force is reviewing and updating University protocols to protect student, faculty, and staff health in campus spaces, including residence halls, classrooms, labs, and libraries. Additional information and details will be available on the Back to School page as soon as it is available. If I plan to enroll full-time for summer quarter, can it count as a regular quarter instead of my annual vacation quarter? Yes, if you will enroll full-time for summer quarter (12 credits for undergraduate students / 10 credits for graduate students) and will not work more than 20 hours per week on campus, it will be considered a regular quarter. Summer quarter credits are a combination of full term, A term, and B term credits. Note: Only during the annual vacation quarter can you work on campus more than 20 hours per week. Review our Annual Vacation Quarter Eligibility. If you want to change your annual vacation quarter to autumn, winter, or spring instead, you must complete the Alternative Vacation Quarter Request. You can submit the alternative vacation quarter request after registration begins for that quarter. Can I return home for classes and will my F-1 or J-1 SEVIS record and I-20 or DS-2019 remain valid? The U.S. government confirmed that international students can temporarily engage in distance-learning, either from within the U.S. or outside the country, in light of COVID-19. SEVP will provide updated guidance as additional information concerning the scope and length of this situation becomes clearer. This guidance allows ISS to keep F-1 and J-1 SEVIS records active for students studying online full-time, either in the U.S. or at home. More information can be found here, PDF. I am planning to return home but my planned time outside the U.S. may be 5 months or more. Will I be able to return to the U.S. with my SEVIS I-20 and F1 visa? If you stayed enrolled full-time through online course work through spring quarter 2020, you will not be impacted by this rule. Whether you decide to stay in the U.S. or travel home, you will be able to return to the U.S. using the same SEVIS I-20. If you decided not to take courses spring quarter and you requested a Leave of Absence, but you plan to study full-time for summer quarter, then you will not be impacted by this rule. If you decided to take both spring and summer quarters off and you requested a Leave of Absence but you plan to return to the UW for autumn quarter 2020, then you will be impacted by this rule. Under current government policies, you must complete the Return to UW process to request a new I-20. Also, if your existing F-1 visa will expire, you will be required to apply for a new visa. Review the Embassy or Consulate's visa appointment information where you before you make final travel plans. I am currently in my home country and was planning to return to the U.S. for an upcoming quarter. What should I do? Every student's situation is different. Summer quarter instruction will be offered remotely for A and B term as well as the full summer term. No decision has been made yet about fall quarter. Once an announcement is made, the UW community will be notified and this page will be updated. If you are unable to enroll or return to the U.S. for an upcoming quarter, we encourage you to consider the following options: Immigration Leave of Absence Process Vacation Quarter (if eligible) Medical Reduced Course Load (if applicable) Consider Study Abroad credits/independent study/online course If you have further questions after reviewing the above web pages, complete our "Have a Question” form. An ISS advisor will reply to you directly about your options. We are receiving a very high volume of emails, however, so it may take 2-4 business days for a reply. I am an admitted international student for an upcoming quarter. Will I be able to begin classes at the UW? Will I be able to defer my admission if I cannot begin classes? The Undergraduate Admissions and Graduate Admissions offices work with all newly admitted international students. Those offices will process and issue immigration documents for new students. ISS will begin processing immigration records and benefits for students once they are enrolled full-time and classes begin. Questions about immigration documents, obtaining a visa, and deferring admission should be directed to Undergraduate Admissions for freshman and transfer students or Graduate Admissions for Master's and PhD students. UW Graduate School: COVID-19 Admissions FAQs or Covid-19 Information Undergraduate Office of Admissions: COVID-19 Admissions FAQs Graduating Students I am graduating and want to apply for OPT. Do I have to remain in the U.S.? Currently, government guidance states you must be in the U.S. to apply for OPT. There has been no official USCIS change or update to that policy. Because this policy is still in place, students who choose to leave the U.S. and enroll in spring quarter remotely will need to balance the risks. Universities across the U.S. have advocated together for a temporary change to the current policy and a formal petition letter has been submitted to USCIS. There has been no response or update yet but we continue to monitor the situation and will post updates to this page if anything changes. I am planning to graduate soon. What are my options? Every student's situation is different. We encourage you to review the Final Quarter Checklist to learn about your options. If you still have questions after reviewing the information, complete our "Have a Question” form. An ISS advisor advisor will reply to you directly about your options. We are receiving a very high volume of emails, however, so it may take 2-4 business days for a reply. I am nearing the end of my F-1 status and was planning to return home. What are my options? Every student's situation is different. We encourage you to review the Final Quarter Checklist to learn about your options. If you still have questions after reviewing the information, complete our "Have a Question” form. An ISS advisor advisor will reply to you directly about your options. We are receiving a very high volume of emails, however, so it may take 2-4 business days for a reply. My status is expiring soon and flights to my home country are cancelled. What should I do? We recognize it is a highly stressful and unpredictable time, with limited travel options and restrictions. Check our "Final Quarter Checklist” to see if any of the options apply to you (practical training, transfer out, etc). Contact your country's embassy here in the U.S. to see if any accommodations could be made to assist with your return home. Complete the Have a Question web form to report your situation to an ISS advisor. Submit a Change of Status application to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. If you wish to consider this option, we recommend you to consult an immigration attorney for legal advice on the change of visa status process. The U.S. government has not announced any kind of automatic extension of grace periods as of now, but this concern has been raised by U.S. institutions and immigration attorneys across the U.S. We will post to this page any updates or changes to this policy when new information becomes available. We encourage you to check this page and the FAQs regularly since this scenario will be very common for many international students. We hope to have an update from the government on this topic. How do I change from F status to tourist or visitor status? Many students apply for employment authorization, or start a new program. But if those are not an option for you and you are unable to depart the U.S. within the grace period following your UW program, you can apply to change status to another visa category. It is possible to file a Form I-539 change of status application from F-1 or J-1 student to B-2 visitor for tourism. As the change of status application can be complex and involves risks, we recommend consulting an immigration attorney. Curricular Practical Training (CPT) If my CPT offer becomes remote, can I do it from my home country? Do I still need CPT authorization? If you will remain in the U.S. for spring quarter and will be doing work remotely, you must apply for CPT authorization. You are permitted to do remote work in the U.S. for your CPT activity during the current COVID-19 situation. If you will be outside of the U.S. for the entire length of your internship, you do not need to apply for CPT authorization. We recommend you keep documentation to prove you were physically outside of the U.S. during the entire internship period. Due to Covid-19, my CPT has changed to remote work because of "Stay Home, Stay Healthy." Do I need to report this change to ISS? You are allowed to proceed with your work if you have CPT authorization. The temporary change to remote work (work from home) does not require an update to your I-20 or that you report this information to ISS. However, we do recommend you keep documentation of your remote work for your personal records. Due to COVID-19, my CPT position has been cancelled. How do I cancel my CPT or notify ISS of this change? Report your pending or approved CPT position has been cancelled to the ISS by submitting our Cancellation Request web form. If you have already started worked or participated in any orientation/training activities for this employer: SEVIS does not allow retroactive CPT authorization cancellations. ISS advisers will shorten the authorization to the last day you worked with the employer. You will still be required to register for and earn CPT-related credit according to the CPT application. If you have not worked or participated in any orientation/training activities for this employer: If ISS processes your cancellation request after the approved CPT start date, ISS advisors can only shorten the authorization to one-day. We cannot remove the CPT authorization after the start date, even if you actually did not start the position. If ISS processes your cancellation before the approved CPT start date, your CPT authorization will be fully cancelled in SEVIS. Due to Covid-19, my CPT position has been delayed to a future quarter. How do I update my CPT? If you have already submitted a CPT application, please complete the Cancellation Request web form. If you plan to delay or resume your CPT, a new CPT application would be required. You should check with your employer and your academic department before submitting a new CPT application. Allow 10 business days for processing your request once the ISS receives a completed application. Optional Practical Training (OPT) I am currently on OPT and cannot find work due to COVID-19. Can the 90-day limit on unemployment be extended? Currently there has been no new guidance from the U.S. government that waives the 90-day unemployment limit for students on OPT. Universities across the U.S. and immigration attorneys have advocated for temporary relief to this limit. As of now, there has been no update. We will post updates to this page when the U.S. government provides updates or new guidance. If you will exceed the 90-day unemployment limit, you should make arrangements to depart the U.S. before the 90 days expires. Note: Unpaid work also counts as OPT activity. You may have better luck finding a volunteer position or an unpaid internship related to your studies. Review information about the kinds of activities that count as OPT employment. What should I do if I have been furloughed or laid off due to the COVID-19 situation? Currently there has been no new guidance from the U.S. government regarding international students on OPT who have lost their employment due to the COVID-19 situation. Universities across the U.S. and immigration attorneys have requested new guidance, but there has been no update. We recommend consulting an immigration attorney to discuss your options. Things to consider: Will you remain on company payroll with benefits? Do you expect to return to work after a period of time (temporary furlough)? This situation may be less risky to your unemployment accrual since you are maintaining an employer/employee relationship even though you are not currently following your day to day work schedule. Were you laid off with the expectation that you would need to re-apply or be re-hired by them? This situation is more of a risk to your unemployment limit and recommend consulting an immigration attorney to discuss your options. This scenario is unprecedented, so working with an experienced immigration lawyer is strongly advised. We will post updates to this page when the U.S. government provides updates or new guidance. Can I apply for unemployment benefits? Eligibility for unemployment benefits is a complicated combination of immigration and labor laws. There is some concern that accepting unemployment benefits could count as being a "public charge” and potentially affect eligibility for future immigration benefits. It seems, however, some exceptions might be made by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for cases severely affected by COVID-19. We recommend consulting an immigration attorney before applying for unemployment benefits to learn more about potential consequences. If you decide to apply for unemployment, be sure to keep documentation of how your employment was directly impacted by COVID-19. You may also want to consider other financial support resources. International Student Health Insurance Program (ISHIP) For updates on ISHIP waivers, remote medical care, coverage during spring or summer quarter, etc., review the ISHIP and Coronavirus FAQ page. Travel Restrictions – students in the U.S. I am currently in the U.S. but was planning to travel outside of the U.S. Should I cancel my trip? We do not know how long these travel restrictions will last and what additional countries may be added to the restrictions already in place. With the growing cases now in the U.S., additional restrictions could be implemented within the U.S. Although there are no restrictions now, that could change without much notice. If you decide to travel, be prepared, understand the risks, and be advised that you might not be able to return to the U.S. for an unknown period of time. Your trip could be disrupted, or you may be quarantined upon your return. If your travel is related to your academic program, please consult your department or academic adviser about your travel plans. Travel Restrictions – students outside the U.S. Which countries are impacted by the coronavirus travel restrictions to the U.S.? The May 24 Presidential Proclamation updates previous travel restrictions. It suspends entry into the U.S. of all non-U.S. citizens who were physically present within the following countries during the 14-day period preceding their entry to the U.S. People's Republic of China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau) Islamic Republic of Iran Schengen Area (Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland) United Kingdom, excluding overseas territories outside of Europe Ireland Brazil Please continue to monitor the news, airline travel information, and this web page for changes or updates. Can I travel to another country before traveling to the U.S.? If you plan to travel to another country before entering the U.S., be sure to review travel restrictions for that country before making travel plans. Many countries around the world have restricted travel to/from other countries so be sure to review travel restrictions before you travel. Be aware that you must remain physically present outside of the country impacted by travel restrictions for 14 days or more before you will be allowed to enter the U.S. ISS advisors cannot advise on travel to countries other than the U.S. Make sure you do your research and understand any restrictions or requirements before traveling. How long will these travel restrictions last? This is unknown. The U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services will monitor the situation and will advise whether the restriction continue, change, or end. See the proclamation. I am currently in a country impacted by the travel restrictions. Can I provide a negative test result for COVID-19 to enter the U.S.? The U.S. government is not allowing exceptions at this time. Continue to monitor the news or this web page for updates. I am currently in a country impacted by the COVID-19 travel restrictions but have not been near any of the impacted cities. Can I return to the U.S.? The U.S. government is not allowing exceptions at this time. Continue to monitor the news or this web page for updates. My planned time outside the U.S. will be 5 months or more. I have heard there is a maximum 5 month limit. Can I still return to the U.S.? If you stay enrolled full-time in online coursework during Spring 2020, you will not be impacted by this rule. If you request a Leave of Absence because you will not study in Spring 2020, but you are able to return and study full-time in Summer 2020, you will not be impacted by this rule. If you request a Leave of Absence and your goal is to return for Autumn 2020 (no study in Spring or Summer) then you will be impacted by this rule. Under current government policies, you must complete the Return to UW processes. Also, if your existing F-1 visa will expire before your return, you would need to apply for a new one at a U.S. Embassy or Consulate before you can travel to the U.S. Review the Embassy or Consulate's visa appointment information where you before you make final travel plans. Campus Resources for International Students I am feeling very anxious about COVID-19. What should I do? If you are experiencing stress or anxiety about this situation, we encourage you to reach out to counselors, advisers, or friends to talk about your feelings. UW Counseling Services and UW Hall Health and are available to help. You can visit the ISS Campus Resources webpage for a list of support services. I need to stay in the U.S. this summer but I am not planning to take any summer classes. Will on-campus housing be available for summer quarter? Students are eligible for summer quarter housing, even if you are not taking classes in the summer. If you are enrolled on the Seattle campus for spring quarter or you will be enrolled for autumn quarter, you may apply for on-campus housing. Review the Summer 2020 Housing Guide or email HFSinfo@uw.edu with questions. How can I connect with other international students at the UW? A great place to start is with UW's CIRCLE or FIUTS. Both organizations offer a variety of programs and support for international students. They are dedicated to global engagement, leadership, and cultural understanding. Are there other campus departments or resources to help me? Yes! We have compiled a list of many campus resources on topics such as Academics, Emergency, Employment & Financial, Health & Student Support, Housing, Food, & Family, etc. Financial Resources for International Students How do apply for Severe Economic Hardship or Special Student Relief work authorization? We recognize this is a difficult and financially challenging time for international students. Below is information about applying for Economic Hardship. Currently enrolled students in F-1 status Review ISS instructions and information on the Severe Economic Hardship work authorization application Special Student Relief work authorization requires a Federal Register announcement from the U.S. government for Special Student Relief; there has not been such an announcement currently. If your request is approved, you may be able to work off-campus in one-year intervals up to the expected date of completion of your current course of study. See 8 CFR 214.2(f)(9)(ii). https://www.uscis.gov/humanitarian/special-situations Additional emergency aid resources Currently enrolled students in J-1 status Review instructions about employment permission for serious economic circumstances Graduated students in F-1 status with pending OPT applications The work authorizations referenced above require you to be a currently enrolled student or for there to have been a Federal Register announcement for Special Student Relief (there has not been such an announcement currently). OPT will be the fastest form of work authorization through USCIS currently. We will post updated information here if the U.S. government makes announcements providing financial relief for students in F-1 status. I am having difficulty paying my tuition by the deadline. What should I do? Contact Student Fiscal Services about your situation before the tuition deadline to help you determine what options may be available. For limited short-term Emergency Aid, including medical bills, housing/rent, food, transportation fees, or other basic necessities, please complete the Emergency Aid Request. Are international students eligible to receive COVID-19 economic stimulus relief? ISS advisors are not tax experts and are unable to provide tax advice. ISS purchases access codes for UW international students and scholars to access Glacier Tax Prep (GTP), a software program developed for international students. We recommend you create a profile and login to Glacier Tax Prep (GTP) to use the software to understand your tax situation. Most international students and scholars in F or J status are considered nonresidents for tax purposes, which is different from your immigration status. GTP will determine whether you are a resident or nonresident for tax purposes by calculating the number of days you have been in the U.S. After logging in to GTP, you can access answers to the following tax stimulus check questions: Am I eligible to receive a COVID-19 stimulus payment? I received a COVID-19 stimulus payment and should not have – do I have to return it? How do I return an incorrectly received COVID-19 stimulus payment to the IRS? We recommend you review the Glacier Tax Prep FAQ page by logging in or consult a tax expert about the COVID-19 stimulus relief.

Q: How do I move my I-20/SEVIS record to a different U.S. school? Please complete the steps at Transfer Your SEVIS Record. Q: How do I drop a class or withdraw 100% from the quarter? Please complete the online Course Drop Eligibility Assessment. The Course Drop Eligibility Assessment will help you learn if the course drop might affect your F-1 visa status. The immigration rules require full-time enrollment, with limited exceptions: Full-time for undergraduate students = 12 credits Full-time for graduate students = 10 credits. Please review the full-time registration requirements and exceptions If you think you fit into one of exception categories, it may be possible to drop the class without negatively affecting your F-1 status. If you do not fit into one of those categories, a decision to drop below full-time credits (10 or 12) will negatively affect your F-1 status. Another option to consider might be changing the class grading option to satisfactory/non-satisfactory. Or, you might also consider replacing the class with an online class to maintain full-time status. The challenge is that the class would need to count towards the current quarter registration, so you would need to contact the Extension advising office for more information: http://www.pce.uw.edu/online-learning/ Full Name*Please write your full name as it appears on your I-20 or DS-2019Full Name*Official UW Email Address*UW Student ID Number*Current Immigration Status (visa type)*F-1 StudentJ-1 Exchange VisitorH-1B, H-4, E-2, or otherAlternate Email Address Please write your message.* Full Name*Please write your full name as it appears on your I-20 or DS-2019UW Student ID Number*Current Immigration Status (visa type)*F-1 StudentJ-1 Exchange VisitorH-1B, H-4, E-2, or otherCurrent Location*Inside the USAOutside the USAOfficial UW Email Address* Alternate Email Address Please write your question and completely describe your situation* Q: How do I apply for degree study at the University of Washington as an international student?

Q: What should I know about international travel while my OPT is pending?After your final quarter ends, you can travel and reenter the U.S. while your 12-month post-completion OPT application is processing, with or without a job offer. You must carry your OPT receipt notice from USCIS, your OPT I-20, and the other regular travel documents. However, be aware of these risks: USCIS sometimes sends a request to OPT applicants asking for more information or for you to correct a problem with your documentation. These requests are sent by postal mail, so it might be difficult for you to respond if you are not inside the U.S. It is your application, so ISS does not have the authority to respond for you. After your OPT application is approved, you must also have proof of employment and your EAD in order to reenter the U.S. If the OPT application is approved while you are abroad, and if you do not yet have proof of employment or your EAD, this could jeopardize your return to the U.S. You must have a valid F-1 visa to travel during the OPT year (except for short trips to Canada, Mexico, and the Caribbean). It is risky to apply for an F-1 visa while your OPT application is pending. If your current F-1 visa is expired, we recommend waiting until your OPT application is approved and you have a job offer before applying for a new F-1 visa. Q: What should I know about international travel when my OPT is approved?After graduation, if your 12-month post-completion OPT has been approved and your EAD issued, you can travel and reenter the U.S. only if you have proof of employment. If you are still looking for practical training opportunities, you should not travel internationally. Travel Documents OPT I-20 signed for travel by an international student adviser within the last 6 months Proof of employment in your field of study (letter of employment, written job offer) EAD card (on the EAD card, there is a statement "Not Valid For Reentry.” This means the EAD card cannot be used by itself for reentry to the U.S.) Valid passport Unexpired F-1 visa (unless you are Canadian or are returning from a short trip to Canada, Mexico, or the Caribbean, with some exceptions) Visa Renewal You can apply for an F-1 visa during your OPT year. Follow the regular procedures to apply for an F-1 visa outside of the U.S. For the F-1 visa application, plan to provide the documents listed above, as well as proof of financial ability to stay in the U.S. and proof of continuing ties to your home country. Unemployment During Travel After the OPT approval start date, time spent outside the U.S. will count as unemployment against the 90-day limit. However, travel while employed either during a vacation authorized by an employer or as part of your employment will not count as unemployment. Please keep your primary ISS adviser informed of any travel plans while on OPT that may affect your status. Dependents If you have dependents in F-2 status who will travel without you, be sure they carry a photocopy of your EAD card and proof of your employment along with their updated F-2 I-20 that is properly signed for travel.
