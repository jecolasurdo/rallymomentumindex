Discover The Best IB (International Baccalaureate) Schools in India. Why choosing the IB (International Baccalaureate) Curriculum?The IB organization was originally founded as a response to the lack of flexibility in the different school systems around the world. Today, the IB education system is recognized in more than 100 countries worldwide, and many of the major UK and North American universities are very positive towards prospective students with an IB diploma. In an article featured in The Telegraph, John Claugthon, retiring Chief Master of King Edward's School, sheds light on some of the reasons why schools all around the world choose to offer the IB Diploma Programme. He points to the breadth of the programme as one of the key motivations: "IB schools believe that the old dispensation to the narrow world of specialisation won't do any more.”Many universities world-wide follow this line of thought, and an increasing number of them are revising their admissions criteria to attract more IB graduates. Among other examples, Claugthon mentions King's College, London, and points to the fact that 20 percent of the university's new undergraduates are IB students.If you are looking for an education that stimulates and challenges you but also requires hard work, then the IB is the perfect place for you.
