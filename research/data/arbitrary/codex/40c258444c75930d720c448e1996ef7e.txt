I am the only girl in my house which means i'm the queen. I'm a 30 something, Chicana, a Warrior mom, Advocate, Marketing Director, a Daughter, a Sister, a Military Mom, a Tia, a G-ma, a Friend, a Chacon, an Espinosa, a McNiel #Huelga #Resist I'm a mom that buy's "organic" "green" & "made in the USA!" My hubby calls me: "Mi Amor", "Mi Vida", "Mi Corazon", "Babe" or "McNiel" and my son's call me: "Mom" or "Mama". I love social media, laughing, smiling, gardening, decorating, traveling (when i can) and of all things: cleaning my house! I like going for rides on the Harley's, colorful tattoo's, eBaying & browsing Etsy as often as i can, fighting for a cause, & empowering myself and those around me. I have a great job at Poverello House as the Director of Volunteer Services. I have met and continue to meet individuals at Poverello House who will remain a special part of my life. I truly learn something new everyday!
