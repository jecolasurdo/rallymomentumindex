Makes you realize that an expectation of landing a top 15 class is VERY lofty. marcb2 | 1 month 3 weeks # ^ Very lofty. It's probably a similar sized leap from, say, #45-50 to #20 as it is from #20 to, say, #14. HT SF  | 1 month 3 weeks # ^ I'd be happy to make the first leap, spend a couple years proving we can hold there, then worry about making the second leap. marcb2 | 1 month 3 weeks # ^ First leap? VT's been in the 20-30 range most years since the early 2000s. HT SF  | 1 month 3 weeks # ^ I mean the 15-20 range. Solidify that, then climb to the 10-15 range. I can dream, that's allowed. gobble gobble chumps PLS | 1 month 3 weeks # After a good talk with coach @BillTeerlinck I'm blessed to announce that I have received an offer from Virgina Tech @MHS_FB_Recruits #wawg #wawn pic.twitter.com/NrU8P5B4vN— iamjonathanjones🦍🎒 (@they_callmejon) April 30, 2020 12 P5 offers "Why gobble gobble chumps asks such good questions, I will never know." - TheFifthFuller gobble gobble chumps PLS | 1 month 3 weeks # Top-13 for Tyrion Ingram Dawkins Top 13 🪐 Edit: @Hayesfawcett3 @DemetricDWarren pic.twitter.com/3F6EROSIRV— Tyrion Ingram-Dawkins ⁹⁰ (@TyrionI27) April 30, 2020 "Why gobble gobble chumps asks such good questions, I will never know." - TheFifthFuller jmecca 🧡🏈 | 1 month 3 weeks # ^ He claims to be the #1 player in SC, but 247 has him rated as a 3 star?

If you look at ND roster, they have 10-11 CB listed currently. Just estimating, but you would think that Max #CB for then this cycle would be 2-3. When you are at the top of the food chain, you might be able to slow-play a 4*, if you don't hit on higher-rated guys, then they become a take. If they commit to someone else in the meantime, that makes it likely harder to do. To be clear, most P5 teams play this game, VT included. Its just our "non-committables" are prob mid-low 3*. Its a crappy system, but it shows how vital it is to have Recruiters on staff who are "closers."

HokieDoug96 | 1 month 3 weeks # Somebody please clear up some confusion for me. Riley says he's not committing until he (and mom) can see campuses. It's a recruiting dead period (just verified on NCAA website it lasts until May 31). How does someone recruit or alter a recruits decision that drastically, that quickly (without coaches being able to talk to him)? Oh, and presumably without visiting campus (because apparently that's what was keeping him from committing to Tech). I'm assuming if he visited campus (just showed up), it would still be a recruiting violation for the coaches to talk to him. What am I missing? Joe Lanza PUBLISHER | 1 month 3 weeks # ^ Who said he wasn't committing until he and his mom visited? I hadn't heard that. HokieDoug96 | 1 month 3 weeks # ^ My bad on that. I just went and looked at the April thread. Somebody posted that, but gave no embedded tweet or news quote or anything to substantiate it. Still wondering how seeing all this stuff about ND "making a push" to get him and the massive swing in crystal ball selections from national recruiting analysts during a recruiting dead period is even remotely legit. I didn't think the coaches were allowed to talk to the recruits, let alone "make a push." shakeitallabout | 1 month 3 weeks # ^ Pretty bizarre that what, 2 weeks ago?, he tweeted at two national analysts that he had made a decision and both of those analysts put crystal balls in for VT. But whatever recruiting seemingly makes even less sense than usual right now. Joffrey, Cersei, Ilyn Payne, the Hound, Jeff Jagodzinski, Paul Johnson, Pat Narduzzi. swanny26 | 1 month 2 weeks # ^ Coaches can talk all they want. Just a dead period for in person recruiting. "Question No. 1: May an institution's coach video call a prospective student-athlete to conduct a tour of the institution's athletics and on-campus facilities? Answer: Yes. A coach may video call a prospective student-athlete to conduct a campus tour. A video call (e.g., Zoom, Skype, FaceTime) is considered a phone call. However, telephone recruiting restrictions (e.g., first opportunity to contact) continue to apply to prospective studentathletes and coaching staff members." Ncaa.org Henry Skutt  | 1 month 3 weeks # ^ (the campus reason was an excuse to push back his commitment to VT) gfs_hokie | 1 month 3 weeks # ^ This kind of sounds like the kid was all in on VT per crystal balls and rumors he wanted to commit ASAP and the parent(s) were all in on ND.

HokieinFLA  | 1 month 1 week # ^ If they care about getting to the NFL, Chad Morris doesn't have any track record of getting his own QBs there...

SevenLayersofPlayers 669TH MEMBER OF TKPC | 1 month 1 week # ^ To a 17-year-old kid, a half-season of Deshawn Watson is better than a mediocre starting QB (Dalton) and a first-round bust (Lynch).

The only pitch Morris can offer is "how would you like to be the next Tahj Boyd" Rayo | 1 month 1 week # ^ In fact Morris has never really done anything to show his offenses are better than Fuente's except have players like Sammy Watkins Andre Ellington and Martavis Bryant. He *could* be a better offensive coach but it's hard to really tell, there are no great comparisons. Nneckhokie84  | 1 month 1 week # ^ Maybe chad morris is not a better coach, but a better recruiter than fuente. shakeitallabout | 1 month 1 week # ^ Why exactly are we comparing Auburn's offensive coordinator to our head coach like that's apples to apples again?? If we want to compare coaches, it's Fuente to Malzahn OR Cornelsen to Morris. Malzahn has an even stronger reputation as an offensive coach than Fuente and was largely credited with Auburn's national championship. Morris flopped at Arkansas and you can debate his merits as an offensive coach but he's still a far bigger name than Cornelsen. Most people are going to take the Auburn coaches on name recognition alone but I can't say I'd argue with anyone who said Auburn has stronger coaches either. We obviously need to see more from Fuente and Cornelsen at the P5 level. All that said, it still makes very little sense to juxtapose Fuente and Morris in this situation. Joffrey, Cersei, Ilyn Payne, the Hound, Jeff Jagodzinski, Paul Johnson, Pat Narduzzi. Chris TEEMING WITH INTEL | 1 month 1 week # ^ This is hilarious. Chad's offense at Clemson from 2011-2013 were all better than any offense we had even 2016. That offense won them games against Georgia, LSU, Ohio State, FSU, Auburn, and VT every time we met. I also love that Fuente gets full credit for all his offenses and Chad gets his discredited because he had good WR's and a solid but unspectacular back like Ellington. He also had all-world running back Roderick McDowell, we better knock him for that too. If you can't see how wildly biased that take is I don't know what to tell you. Also, the idea that Clemson's offense got better after Morris left has a lot to do with the foundation Morris built (they still run his offense, using his playbook), and because they have had two first round QB's since then, the first of which (Watson) Morris was the primary recruiter and primary reason Deshaun Watson came to Clemson. Morris left them with enhanced recruiting, and a very solid foundation on offense. The talent on the team increased in all areas of the field and naturally their recent offenses that won championships may be considered better, but they had better OL's, better RB's, and elite QB's. Also, there are a lot of metrics where the 2013 Clemson O is still one of if not their best and most explosive offense. I wouldn't personally call it their best one because I would pick a Deshaun Watson led offense based on him alone, but there is an analytic backed argument to suggest it was. Also, Clemson fans aren't too happy with their play caller at the moment. They thought Chad was too aggressive, and Tony Elliot is too conservative and uncreative. So much like any other fanbase they like to complain a lot too. edit: I just realized this wasn't the damn Discourse thread...

I've always been a Chad Morris fan; I wanted VT to hire him in 2015, and I thought he was a great hire by Arkansas. I was clearly wrong; he doesn't seem to be a good head coach (although, he decided to take one of the toughest job in G5, then again in P5, so I do think he needs to be 'graded on a curve,' but I digress), but I see no reason to believe he's lost the ability to be a good OC. His Clemson offense is my dream offense. Everyone is a threat at all times, the receivers are always blocking, and it's just fun to watch.

Recruiting isn't an infinite resource exercise -- either AHB is getting the attention and time and energy, or someone else is getting the attention and time and energy.

HeloHokie '06 | 1 month 1 week # The only prospects that will truly define this class is whether or not VT is able to sign any of the following: Leigh, Brown, Gilliam, Tyleik, and Watson AKA the best OL/DL talent that are even remotely warm towards VT. If Leigh and Brown are indeed now a package deal, then I will assume that means LSU won the battle as a lot of the recent chatter surrounding Brown has him leaning to the Tigers. With Gilliam looking strongly at OU, that leaves Tyleik and Watson as the primary focus of the staff. If VT misses out on both, then it will definitely be another class ranked in the 60-70s range. Sadly, after getting a better look at VT's dearth in recruiting capacity (Sons of Saturday podcast), knowing how far ahead the truly elite programs are in terms of funding, marketing, graphics, staff, facilities, etc., the debacle over the winter with Fuente and Baylor, how even the mid tier ACC teams are performing better, as well as the downward trend of the program over the last few years, VT will probably end up at or possibly even worse than the final 2020 recruiting rankings.

Noble-Hokie | 1 month 6 days # ^ Neville dropped to 3* as well shakeitallabout | 1 month 6 days # ^ While we're on the topic, I recently noticed that Latrell Neville was had slipped down to a 3* as well. Edit: Cheers! Joffrey, Cersei, Ilyn Payne, the Hound, Jeff Jagodzinski, Paul Johnson, Pat Narduzzi. Rocco | 1 month 6 days # ^ So he's more likely to end up at VT now? jmecca 🧡🏈 | 1 month 6 days # ^ Forgive what might be a dumb question. Why does Jack Hollifield's ranking keep going down? 757hokie83 | 1 month 6 days # ^ He's losing his skills by the day j/k Now finish up them taters; I'm gonna go fondle my sweaters. dave WHERE'S DAVE? | 1 month 6 days # ^ I think his rating is still based on being a LB. I think he's going to play offense though. And as a TE prospect, he's not an elite pass catcher, but he'll definitely be a really good in-line blocking TE/HB. Those guys aren't typically rated really high but are vital recruits. WHS | 1 month 6 days # ^ I think no one is sure exactly where to play him. Some staffs like him as a DE too. boylejc2 | 1 month 6 days # ^ This may be a better topic for the discussion thread, but I believe it's because of his position, or lack thereof in 247's eyes. He's been listed as an athlete, inside linebacker, and tight end (honestly not sure what he's currently listed as cause his current position and history page don't match). As a complete side note: why is he Jack when his brother is Dax? Shouldn't he be Jax? Like some Mortal Kombat shit? HokieSax14  | 1 month 5 days # ^ WHS | 1 month 6 days # ^ I love Poole's film, athletically there aren't too many people out there like him, but ranking him at 65 strikes me as a bit high. Most of his Hudl is him playing RB or free safety, I get the sense he's going to be a bit of a project. kff17 | 1 month 5 days # ^ 247 has made a big push to re-evaluate what trends are going on at the NFL draft. And what's hot right now is LBs that were undersized but could fly around in HS. dave WHERE'S DAVE? | 1 month 5 days # ^ picked up offers from Florida State and Boston College VTBeamer | 1 month 6 days # Tony Grimes just got multiple CBs today to UNC of all places.
