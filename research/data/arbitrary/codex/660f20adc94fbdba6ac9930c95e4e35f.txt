The first webinar is being is delivered on February 18th at 12:00pm: Advancing Peer Support Research in Canada This webinar will share insights gained from an ongoing study called Peer support and Occupational Wellbeing Research (POWeR). POWeR is a 2-year longitudinal study examining the impacts of peer support on occupational outcomes, such as wellbeing, perceived inclusion climate, work engagement and/or engagement in daily occupations (e.g., involvement in the community). This study has been designed by researchers from Wilfrid Laurier University and the Université du Québec à Montréal, in collaboration with peer support organizations across Ontario. The goal of this research is to contribute to the limited but growing body of literature that empirically demonstrates the value of peer support. Throughout this webinar, we will provide an overview of previous research related to peer support and discuss why research in this area is important. The implications of this study, as well as opportunities to become involved, will also be discussed.
