Ratings and Reviews See All 4.8 out of 5 12.4K Ratings 12.4K Ratings 1960 Tiger , 10/03/2019 New APP Review As a 1960 LSU Alumni I have enjoyed watching WWL-Tv since the day it joined the air waves. I am a native of Gulfport and had many enjoyable visits to New Orleans, including attending college football games in Tulane Stadium and watching the beloved New Orleans Pels play AA baseball out at the old Pelican Stadium during my early years. Keeping up with news from the NOLA area still brings me much pleasure. After retiring from the U.S. Army in 1985, my late wife and I returned to live in Gulfport, but lost our home to Hurricane Katrina in 1995. I now reside in Spanish Fort, Alabama, on the Eastern Shore Of Mobile Bay.Having said all this, I find your new WWL-TV APP to be quite an advancement, but I'm still trying to work some of the bugs while watching on my iPad. Regardless, please know your newscasts are much appreciated and keep me well informed on events happening in the Crescent City. Regards, Walter Fulton Brocklee69 , 09/20/2019 Horrible. Bring back the old app. I understand the newness of something new but this app and this new update is just horrible. No organization,everything is all over the place just a mess. The radar set up is so hard to fine and very limited. The hurricane section is just not very well set up. This app is not user-friendly at all can't find anything. There is so much going on that the phone lags on everything. This used to be my favorite weather app my go to every day every couple hours but now I'm gonna have to find something else because I just can't deal with this cluster of a mess. The old app was perfect. But no everybody always has to mess with something that's working perfectly. Like they always say if it's not broken don't mess with it. Ugh ðŸ¤¬ Riverrich1942 , 03/21/2020 Very good, but still room to improve Have made many improvements since the beginning. Still have need to improve. The Good Morning and Good Evening seems lame for these times. Just state from the beginning when the information was last updated. PLEASE take a thorough look at the WAFB NEWS SITE. It would be a good learning tool to improve WWL's. WWL is always our go to station with wonderful, friendly professionals giving us the information we need when we need it. We thank each and everyone who works as a team to put together great news and information out to the public multiple times per day, seven days a week. Information Seller Tegna Inc.
