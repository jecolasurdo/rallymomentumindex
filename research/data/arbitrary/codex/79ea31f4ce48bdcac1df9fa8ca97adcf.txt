Election results fuel debate over Electoral College Local News Nov 15, 2016 Hannah Kittle Reporter hkittle@mariettatimes.com Despite the popular vote, President-Elect Donald Trump won the most Electoral College votes and secured his seat as the 45th president of the United States of America on Nov. 9. Mixed opinions surrounding the usefulness of the electoral college have since surfaced, raising conflicted thoughts on the issue. "I don't think it is still needed; I mean, honestly, it's been around since the country started,” said Erica Schexnider, 26, of Marietta. "We should figure out something new because it's outdated and whenever they established it, it was for white men who owned land, so there weren't that many people voting.” When using the Electoral College, each state has votes equal to its congressional delegation. The minimal vote is three as every state has two senators and at least one representative. The smallest listed are Wyoming and Vermont, which both have three Electoral College votes, and the largest is California, which has 55. There are 538 electoral college votes altogether and the first candidate to get 270 votes wins the presidency. According to the Associated Press, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote with a current count of 61,036,331 votes as opposed to Trump's 60,369,997 votes — a difference of 668,483 votes — yet lost the election when it came to the electoral votes as Trump has 290 electoral votes and Clinton has 228 electoral votes. Trump is the fourth president to win the election but not have the popular vote in U.S. history. George W. Bush beat Al Gore in 2000, Benjamin Harrison beat Grover Cleveland in 1888 and Rutherford B. Hayes beat Samuel J. Tilden in 1876, all of whom received the electoral college vote, but did not receive the popular vote. Mike Tager, political science professor at Marietta College, said while he feels the Electoral College is outdated, it would be hard to update it or eliminate it entirely. "I think it's unlikely to be changed,” he said. "There needs to be a constitutional amendment, which is very difficult to do.” Tager said initially the Electoral College was put into motion for a couple of reasons when the constitution was written. "They weren't confident, given the state of communications and the media being local rather than national, people would be able to make an informed decision,” he said. "Also, the southern states objected because they realized 90 percent of the slaves lived in the southern states and it would give them less voting power.” However, he said these scenarios are no longer relevant in society today. "Obviously, slavery has been abolished,” he said. "And with the rise of the two-party system and of media, people can make more informed decisions.” Tager added a movement involving states and the electoral college is starting, but he feels it won't get very far as changing the electoral college system. "There is a movement afoot where some states have said they were going to tie their electoral college vote to the national majority,” said Tager. "Though, I think we are probably stuck with it; I don't think it's likely to change.” Some locals feel the electoral college is important, but could use some adjustments. Jason King, 38, of Bartlett, said he feels the Electoral College could use a little adjusting. "It kind of helps regulate the balance of power, but I also believe if the people vote the majority, that person should win,” said King. "It's an old system, so maybe we should tweak a few things.” On the other hand, Tara Varnell, 25, of Caldwell, said the Electoral College is very important. "I do think that it is important,” she said. "Where I'm from, we would have absolutely no say if there wasn't an Electoral College.” Tager noted while there have been protests, he expects Trump will take the office in January. "I expect it will be like 2000; people will accept the verdict of the Electoral College because that's the way we do it,” he said. "It's in the constitution, it's in the rules, Clinton conceded.” At a glance Years when the Electoral College vote beat the popular vote ¯2016: Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton. ¯2000: George W.
