In 2015, he died at age 27 after overdosing on the powerful synthetic opioid, fentanyl. Laura Hope Laws, 17, Morphine and Cocaine Laura was an active church youth group member, a star varsity soccer player, and kind to many people.

In retrospect, we realized it was drug related, but at the time, the explanation he gave us made sense. It was all a lie. Drug activity is typically associated with violence and deception. Mark Bauer, 18, Prescription Drugs As told by his father, Phil Bauer Since the death of my youngest son, Mark, I have asked myself so many questions over and over again.

If I hadn't missed the signs of an addiction problem, would Mark still be alive? Jason Surks, 19, Prescription Drugs I worked for a community-based substance abuse prevention agency and so did my son, Jason. Jason knew the dangers.

He had the highest respect for his parents and was very kind at heart. He adored his baby brother, Ethyn and younger sister, Erika. He was raised in a solidly Christian home, and had embraced his faith. A hard working young man, he was attending a local community college, studying hard—he had a plan for his life, a direction.
