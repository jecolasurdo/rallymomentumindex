There's the question of what to do with tuition refunds — if you got one when colleges closed and sent kids home — especially if tuition was paid with money taken from a tax-advantaged 529 education savings plan. Then there's the question of whether you should still make payments on a student loan even if you don't have to because of the coronavirus.Support our journalism.

For some families, it's a welcome injection of money.ADADBut the refunds have created concern for people who paid for college expenses with money withdrawn from a 529 college savings plan.A 529 plan allows contributions to grow tax-free. If the funds are used for qualified educational expenses — required textbooks, computers, related equipment, software and Internet access as well as tuition, room and board — earnings are not taxed.However, if money from a 529 plan is used for something other than qualified education expenses, what the IRS refers to as a "non-qualified” distribution, the account holder has to pay income taxes on the earnings and an additional 10 percent penalty.Typically, if you withdraw money from a 529 plan and need to put it back, you have 60 days from the date of the refund to return the funds without incurring a penalty.ADBut these are not normal times. Because of the pandemic, the IRS has issued guidance that gives 529 plan account holders a longer window to return the refunded money, according to Roger Young, a senior financial planner at T. Rowe Price.ADIf the 60-day period ended on or after April 1, account holders have until the July 15 tax deadline to replace the money without incurring taxes or the 10 percent penalty.The extra time means some families won't have to worry about putting the money back into the 529 because they will soon be paying it right back out again when their kid returns to college in the fall."For a beneficiary continuing college in the fall, the family probably doesn't have to worry about re-contributing,” Young said. "The fall qualified expenses will likely be much more than the refund they received.”ADIf your child is graduating and won't need the money, another option is to put the funds back into the 529 and transfer it to a sibling or another eligible family member, Young said."If a student is graduating this spring and is considering future graduate school, then any refunds may still be redeposited into their 529 plan account to remain invested in perpetuity until that future scenario plays out," said Vivian Tsai, senior director with TIAA's Education Savings business.ADWith more classes perhaps being taught online, you might use the money to upgrade your child's computer, Tsai said.Q: With all the recent market volatility, should I continue contributing to a 529 plan?A: Even if college campuses don't reopen for in-person classes, you'll need money to pay for tuition and fees.ADA 529 plan still remains attractive for the tax benefits, Tsai said. The majority of 529 plans provide account owners with access to professionally managed investment portfolios and diverse investment choices, including principal-protected or money market options."Generally speaking, the sooner that the money is needed, the more conservatively the funds should be invested,” Tsai said. "It can be risky to have excessive exposure to asset classes with higher expected volatility, like stock.”Q: Should I continue making student loan payments? A: The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act or Cares Act automatically suspended payments for most people with federal student loans until Sept. 30.ADADDuring this payment "pause,” interest on federal loans owned by the government is effectively reset to zero percent.If you've lost your job or been furloughed, you may not have a choice. You have to take the payment break.But you might want to consider continuing to make payments if you can afford it. Keep in mind that every penny of your payment goes straight to reducing your principal, which will save you money in the end.However, if you qualify for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program, or you're close to loan forgiveness for an income-based payment plan, you could use the payment break to cover other expenses, or build your savings.ADBy the way, if you meet all the conditions under the PSLF program, you will receive credit toward loan forgiveness for any payments that are waived due to the Cares Act. It would be as if you made the payments.ADcomment0 CommentsToday's HeadlinesThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy PolicyToday's HeadlinesThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy PolicyAbout UsPublic RelationsCareersNewspaper in EducationToday's PaperWP BrandStudioEventsPolicies & StandardsGet The PostHome DeliveryDigital SubscriptionGift SubscriptionsMobile & AppsNewsletters & AlertsWashington Post LiveReprints & PermissionsPost StorePhoto Storee-ReplicaHelpContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareReader RepresentativeAdvertiseLicensing & SyndicationRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipTerms of UseDigital Products Terms of SalePrint Products Terms of SaleTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicySubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choiceswashingtonpost.com © 1996-2020 The Washington Postwashingtonpost.com© 1996-2020 The Washington PostContact the NewsroomContact Customer CareRequest a CorrectionSend a News TipDownload the Washington Post AppPolicies & StandardsTerms of ServicePrivacy PolicyPrint Products Terms of SaleDigital Products Terms of SaleSubmissions & Discussion PolicyRSS Terms of ServiceAd Choices Subscriber sign inWe noticed you're blocking ads!Keep supporting great journalism by turning off your ad blocker.
