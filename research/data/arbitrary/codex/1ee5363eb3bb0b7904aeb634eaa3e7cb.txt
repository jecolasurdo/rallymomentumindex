Dining Watterson Dining Commons Watterson Dining Commons is open to students, faculty, and staff, but will not offer any self-service options. Staff members will serve food to customers and ensure that customers in line and those who eat in the dining center follow the guidelines for social distancing. The Marketplace at Linkins dining center is closed the week of March 16 -22, and updates will be provided as more information becomes available. Bone Student Center On Sunday, March 15, Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker announced that restaurants and bars across the state would be closed beginning at the close of business on Monday, March 16, and would remain closed until March 30. The Governor's order impacts retail food venues in the Bone Student Center. McAlister's Deli will remain open, but all meals purchased will be for carry-out only. The McAlister's seating area for dine-in customers will be closed. Starbucks and The Landing will remain open and will continue to provide carry-out service. Seating outside Starbucks and The Landing is not dedicated to any one venue, but staff will remove chairs in order to allow for customers to practice social distancing.

Student Health Services Illinois State's Student Health Services will be open from 8 a.m.-4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday. As an added precaution, all appointments must be made over the phone at (309) 438-2778 to allow for screening for potential symptoms before a patient comes to the office.
