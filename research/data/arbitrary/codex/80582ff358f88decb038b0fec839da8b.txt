Local administrations have often tried to tackle the challenges associated with large population density through territorial-based policies. Until recently, major urban planning strategies covered all aspects of urban planning, both aesthetic and practical: streets, building facades, parks, sewers and water works, facilities and public monuments. Cities today face new challenges and urban planning has adapted to accommodate these. Administrations have to consider the future of our cities in a globalised and interconnected world, and deal with issues such as climate change mitigation, social inclusion and preserving cultural heritage. As described in 'A practitioner's guide to neighbourhood regeneration', our working group on urban regeneration's November 2011 report: "Urban regeneration is a social, economic, physical, sustainable, demographic, financial and collaborative issue”. Urban regeneration is at the core of city planning. Urban regeneration can be defined as the integrated local redevelopment of deprived areas (neighbourhood, city, metropolitan area). It covers many aspects of city life: physical, social and environmental. Approaches depend on a city's history, and therefore policies must be integrated and area-based. 123> environment WG Noise online meeting Wednesday 8 July 2020 event start date: 24-06-2020 end date: 24-06-2020 mobility City Dialogue: Building a new narrative: 'back to normal' is not the solution Join us on Monday 29 of June, starting from 15.00 (CEST) for our City Dialogue: Building a new narrative: 'back to normal' is not the solution. event start date: 29-06-2020 end date: 29-06-2020 mobility City Dialogue: The long-term impact of COVID19 in the urban mobility context Join us on Wednesday 10 of June, starting from 15.30 (CEST) for our City Dialogue on 'The long-term impact of COVID19 in the urban mobility context.' event start date: 10-06-2020 end date: 10-06-2020 environment knowledge society mobility Sharing Cities' Smart City Solutions – Webinar Series: DSM event start date: 16-06-2020 end date: 16-06-2020 environment knowledge society mobility Sharing Cities' Smart City Solutions – Webinar Series: E-bikes event start date: 30-06-2020 end date: 30-06-2020 mobility Webinar on Business models, funding and financing transport Join our webinar on 2 July from 10:10-12:00 CET on business models, funding, and financing transport to learn from your peers about innovative financing models for urban mobility. event start date: 02-07-2020 end date: 02-07-2020 environment EUROCITIES City Dialogue on Green Recovery with the City of Amsterdam - Doughnut model event start date: 28-05-2020 end date: 28-05-2020 cooperation culture economy environment knowledge society mobility social affairs Cities Today: Cities need more support from the EU in light of the coronavirus Anna Lisa Boni, secretary general, EUROCITIES, shares some thoughts on much needed solidarity at this time, and what cities are already doing to respond both now and for the longer term. publication publication date: 11-05-2020 environment IRENA webinar - Enabling Framework Conditions, Financing and Business Models for District Heating and Cooling event start date: 14-05-2020 end date: 14-05-2020 environment Lahti Energy Choice: supporting citizens' choices for more energy efficient buildings The project 'Energy Choice', was launched by the city of Lahti in 2016 to encourage citizens to renovate their properties through providing information on the potential financial and CO2 savings as a result of adopting energy-efficient solutions. case study publication date: 11-05-2020 123> ©EUROCITIES 2019 linkedin instagram flickr twitter youtube By using this site, you accept our use of cookies to improve performance and your user experience.
