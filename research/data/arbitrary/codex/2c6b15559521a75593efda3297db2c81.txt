They said Tyler's contract negotiations took a bad turn southward last month. Since then, a General Hospital rep confirmed that Tyler won't ever be returning to reprise the Nikolas role. It's not yet known if the show has plans to hire a different actor to play Nikolas or just write him off for good.
