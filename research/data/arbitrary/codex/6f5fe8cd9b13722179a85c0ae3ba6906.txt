Still, quality is better than before the crisis. Mortgage Credit Conditions Tighten Average credit scores increased on last month's mortgage production, while averaged debt-to-income ratios declined. The tighter credit conditions came as refinances continued to make up a diminishing share of mortgage production. Government Loans Drive Mortgage Credit Tightening Changes to government mortgage programs last month drove down overall mortgage credit availability. Jumbo credit conditions, however, were looser.

Behind the contraction was a drop in the number of available jumbo mortgage programs. Partially offsetting jumbo deterioration was an increase in programs with low down payments. 4-Month High for Consumer Bankruptcies Consumer bankruptcies worsened last month, with filings climbing to the highest level in four months. If the trade group for the bankruptcy industry has its way, more consumers will have access to bankruptcy. Financial Counselors Lift Distressed Mortgage Value Investors who acquire distressed home loans at a significant discount could raise the value of their investments with financial counselors who help borrowers increase their cash flow. Refi Share Stays at Record Low, Closing Rate Up As refinances continue to make up the smallest monthly share of mortgage originations during recent years, the closing rate has strengthened, and conventional share has widened. credit news archive bankruptcy news archive Credit News | Bankruptcy Statistics | Credit Score Statistics Credit scores, bureaus & technology.
