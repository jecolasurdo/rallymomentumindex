"It's not the typical college experience, not the typical commute.”Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, undermining her sacrifice and leaving her life and that of most other international students in limbo. The coronavirus has forced universities to postpone, cancel or shift commencement to online virtual ceremonies. But for international students, it has also forced questions about their very future in the U.S.The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has informed universities that if they decide to continue holding classes fully online in the fall, it is unlikely international students will be permitted to cross into the U.S.This despite the fact that international students often pay higher tuition fees than local students, providing an economic boost to many universities around the country.Public HealthWhat you need to know about coronavirus, plus a map of every case in TexasBy Wire Services and Tom SteeleIn 2019, the U.S. issued more than 364,000 F-1 visas for foreign students to study in colleges nationwide, according to the State Department. The U.S. issued more than 194,000 F-1 visas for Mexican students to study in the country from 1997 to 2019.UTEP alone had 1,003 F-1 students from Mexico this spring semester."When we look at being an institution for the region, our region is not just El Paso, it's the entire region that goes on both sides of the border,” said Catie McCorry-Andalis, associate vice president and dean of students at UTEP, who has been appointed by President Heather Wilson to be part of a task force to address the challenges posed by COVID-19."International students in general, especially those from Mexico, add a sense of vibrancy to the campus, they bring a cultural awareness and understanding that we are a global society that is interconnected,” she said.Roberta Jacobson, former U.S. ambassador to Mexico, said foreign students are key to forming ties that bind the U.S. and Mexico."Students who study in Mexico from the U.S. and those from Mexico who study in the U.S. become lifetime ambassadors for the importance of the relationship” between the two economically and culturally connected nations, said Jacobson, now a senior adviser at the Washington-based Albright Stonebridge Group. She's also a board member of the U.S.-Mexico Commission for Educational and Cultural Exchange, or COMEXUS. The nonprofit offers Fulbright Garcia Robles grants and works with students from both sides of the border."If you want stronger countries that live in peace and prosper together over the long term, there's no better investment than education,” she added. "As the military might say — it's a force multiplier.”Across the border, Ciudad Juarez can be seen from the University of Texas at El Paso's campus. Along with other U.S. universities, UTEP has postponed commencement ceremonies as the pandemic continues, leaving students students and their families without a chance to celebrate their achievements.(Especial para DMN)For generations, studying abroad was reserved for Mexico's elite. Then the number of students crossing the border exploded in the 1990s, when Mexico's President Carlos Salinas de Gortari declared he would open his nation to the world through the North American Free Trade Agreement.The opening went beyond trade. A graduate of Harvard University, Salinas de Gortari inspired Mexicans students to study in the U.S. Some headed for Ivy League schools, others to top Texas universities, including Southern Methodist University in Dallas.Luisa del Rosal, a native of Chihuahua City in the state of Chihuahua, Mexico, was all set to attend El Tec de Monterrey, but was tempted by her father, once an executive at Mrs Baird's in Dallas, to visit SMU. Some 16 years later, with a degree in political science, sociology and Italian, del Rosal is executive director of the Texas Mexico Center at the university."I always say Mexico gave me roots, but the U.S. gave me wings, and it was because of my education in the United States,” she said. "My education challenged me to be different and it also challenges other people because it brings somebody with a different background and a different life experience into a classroom with American students, and together we bring about a better understanding about each other and about our countries.”But now, COVID-19 threatens to leave a slew of broken dreams for international students, particularly from Mexico, who see in education the first step onto the stairway of the American dream.Here, on this part of the border, students from Juarez flock to UTEP and El Paso Community College.Among them is Sanchez, who's usually dressed professionally in a blazer. During her first semester, she'd rise at 3 a.m. and head for the international bridge. She did this almost daily for more than four years as an undergraduate student.She decided to attend graduate school in Western Michigan University to continue studying philosophy. Her decision was underscored especially after the pandemic. At least for now, she's secured her legal status in the U.S. as a foreign student, at a time when jobs are difficult to find.Gunnar Mebius, 23, an economics and history major at SMU, said his family, particularly his father, is heartbroken that he won't be able to travel from Saltillo to Dallas to watch his son graduate from SMU. "They planned so long for this moment, to see me really get a taste of the American dream," he said.(Esspecial para DMN)Farther south in Mexico is Gunnar Mebius, 23, an economics and history major at SMU. He said his family, particularly his father, is heartbroken because the family wasn't in Dallas to watch him graduate."Graduation was always the dream,” he said. "Friends, family were looking forward to spending time in Dallas.”What now? Where are the jobs?Mebius is in a tough place. He had planned on returning to Mexico to start his career in the Mexican state of Coahuila, in Saltillo. The pandemic, however, has made him think twice.The coronavirus is a plague on the Mexican economy. The peso continues to weaken and the country is in recession, expected to lose more than a million jobs this year.Moreover, Mebius doesn't expect an economic bailout plan, or any coronavirus plan, from the government of Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. He hopes to return to Dallas and take advantage of the one year left of his student eligibility, looking for internships, ideally in journalism."I think I can play a more constructive role from Dallas because it's more likely that I can find a job there, than here (in Mexico),” said Mebius. "I think being a Mexican student in the United States, particularly Dallas, helped me understand how important it is to be connected with Texas, especially when both sides are going through a difficult time. It's important to help lift each other.”Maria Genoveva Chavez, a student from Chihuahua, recently graduated from UTEP with a marketing degree after five years of school.In the post-pandemic life, she has no idea what her degree might even mean, or what her future can hold. While she says she hopes to find a job in the U.S., she believes that U.S. companies will prioritize citizens before hiring foreigners like her."(My family) started asking me, 'What's going to happen with your graduation?'” she said. "And then it hit me. ... I don't know where I'm going to be in the future.”She has returned to Mexico.Valeria Olivares reported from Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, and El Paso.
