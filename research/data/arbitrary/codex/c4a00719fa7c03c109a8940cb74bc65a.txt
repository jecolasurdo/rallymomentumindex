To learn the lessons of how not to manage an epidemic, it might be helpful to look to Jacksonville's past, namely the 1888 yellow fever epidemic.Jay Driskell, a historian working on a book about Jacksonville before and after the yellow fever outbreak, spoke to the Times-Union and shared three lessons learned from the aftermath of that sickness.In 1887, a decade after Reconstruction ended in the South, an interracial coalition between labor unions, black Republicans and reformer Democrats elected five black men to Jacksonville's City Council. The new City Council began shifting power in a tremendous way rarely seen in the South after Reconstruction.COMPLETE COVERAGE | Coronavirus in Florida Black men became police commissioner, city marshal and municipal judge. Municipal workers' wages went up. The city passed an unprecedented budget.Yet the governing coalition would come crashing down in 1889, after a yellow fever outbreak devastated the city for months, eventually killing 427 people. The epidemic in Jacksonville, Driskell said, was worse than in other cities at the time. The new governor, a segregationist from Duval County, used that excuse to strip the city of home rule, ending an elected City Council in favor of an appointed one until the state could pass disenfranchisement laws to prevent blacks from voting.RELATED | Nate Monroe: Jacksonville beat a pandemic once before. We'll do it againThat decision turned a city where civil rights were beginning to flourish into one where growing hostility led many of its most prominent black residents — newspaperman T. Thomas Fortune; educator, writer and diplomat James Weldon Johnson, labor and civil rights leader A. Philip Randolph — to leave for New York City."It's an incredible story,” Driskell said.The below is a lightly edited transcript of what Driskell said are lessons from Jacksonville's failure to manage the yellow-fever epidemic.This content is being provided for free as a public service to our readers during the coronavirus outbreak.

The mosquitoes became vectors of infection.There are experts. They do know what to do. They've studied this extensively for years. There is knowledge we should not politicize, and we should let certain kinds of experts to lead in this situation.Lesson 2: Quarantines, by their nature, create class conflict.Quarantines have always pitted workers and bosses, citizens and merchants, industrialists and public health advocates.The people who make money on trade and commerce don't want to see things shut down.They will fight and fight and do what they can to subvert quarantines and fight them.When they do so, all they do is prolong the misery. All they do is make things worse, even though they take a financial hit in the end.If Jacksonville had been able to figure out the quarantine more quickly, they might've been able to get through yellow fever quicker than they did.The city government was really still weak. The idea that government should have powers to intervene and declare that everyone should stay indoors, that couldn't have happened in the 1880s. Instead, they needed buy-in from merchants who had to volunteer to shut down.That didn't happen.Lesson 3: Beware of philanthropy replacing government.Private actors who aren't the government used fundraising, used charity, used philanthropy to displace Jacksonville city government.When the yellow fever hits, everybody who has the resources to bug out and leave, they leave and go to New York and form the Jacksonville Auxiliary Sanitary Association. They raise half-a-million dollars in relief funds, which is a lot of money in 1888.They then use this money to run the government by fiat.There's still an elected city government, and they're African-Americans, but the city doesn't have any money. They have no taxation. They're barely surviving.The philanthropy is used to tear down slum areas. They feared these African-American shacks that were off Bay Street.They set themselves up as the people who could solve the problem.Once the yellow fever was done, it wasn't that hard to go to Gov. Francis Fleming and say you can remove home rule and put us in power because we've shown we can do it.The third lesson is: There will be moments where people swoop in and pretend to fix things and will use it to exercise control.Loading...
