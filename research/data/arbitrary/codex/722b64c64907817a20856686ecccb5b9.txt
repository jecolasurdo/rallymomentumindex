Some of the storms over South Alabama could produce small hail and strong winds; SPC has defined a "marginal risk" (level 1/5) for this part of the state through the evening hours.TOMORROW AND THE WEEKEND: The upper trough that has been over the region all week will lift out tonight, and the air should be a little more stable tomorrow through Sunday. This means showers and storms will be more scattered nature, and fewer in number. For each day we expect a partly sunny sky with random, scattered showers and thunderstorms generally between 1:00 and 9:00 p.m. Odds of any one spot getting wet each day will around 40 percent, and highs will be in the mid to upper 80s.NEXT WEEK: We aren't expecting much change. Fairly routine late June weather with the risk of pop-up, splash and dash showers and storms during the afternoon and evening hours. Partly sunny days, highs between 86 and 90 most days.TROPICS: The Atlantic basin is quiet, and tropical storm formation is not expected through the weekend.AFRICAN DUST: The SAL (Saharan Air Layer) has moved up into the Gulf Coast region this morning, and will cover more of Alabama tomorrow and over the weekend. The sky is hazy today in places like New Orleans, Biloxi, and Gulf Shores thanks to the dust, which is mostly several thousand feet off the ground.This is dry, dusty air that originated over the African continent a couple of weeks ago, and can make the sky rather hazy. There will some reduction in air quality, but it won't bother most people. The dust will scatter sunlight, bring potential for vivid sunrises and sunsets. This is not unusual, and it happens just about every summer. The size of this SAL is larger than usual, however.ON THIS DATE IN 1967: Three, F3 tornadoes crossed the Netherlands on this day. The first tornado touched down at 4:17 PM in Oostmalle. This storm destroyed the church and the center of the village. More than half of the 900 homes in the community were damaged with 135 completely gone. The second tornado touched down near Ulicoten and tracked northward through woodlands area. This storm killed two people at a camping site near Chaam, Netherlands. The third tornado destroyed 50 houses in Tricht, killing five and injuring 32 others.BEACH FORECAST: Get the latest beach forecast for the Gulf Coast here.SEVEN DAY FORECAST: See a detailed seven-day forecast here.SUNRISE05:39:08 amSUNSET08:01:06 pmToday's Record TemperaturesRecord High101FRecord Low49FWeather CamerasVIEW ALL CAMERASMount CheahaClantonBirmingham AirportHelpful Weather LinksNational Weather ServiceThunderstorms and Lightning Weather ServiceNational Allergy LevelsLightning Safetycomponent-footer-debug-v1-01
