By Chas Early Last updated: 14 January 2019 - 10.54am Operation Desert Storm, the allied military operation led by the United States to liberate Kuwait from occupation by the Iraqi army, began with an aerial bombing campaign on this day in 1991. Saddam Hussein's troops had entered the country in August the previous year and in spite of economic sanctions, extensive diplomacy and widespread condemnation from both the Arab and western world, they refused to leave. A UN Security Council resolution demanded their withdrawal by January 15, and authorised the use of force by its member states if Iraq did not comply. As shown in the video above, Saddam's response was to set fire to Kuwait's oil fields, and when the UN deadline passed, the coalition began a series of devastating bombing raids. More than 1,000 sorties were flown in the first 24 hours. Targets were mainly military and strategic, but the Iraqi capital Baghdad was heavily hit, causing many civilian casualties. The raids were initially reported on CNN, but within two hours President George Bush had appeared on television to state the objectives of Desert Storm – to force Iraqi troops out of Kuwait, restore its government, and protect their allies in the area. In Baghdad, Saddam Hussein made his own televised address, urging the Iraqi people to "stand up to evil". The following day, Iraq would launch its first Scud missile attack against Israel.

Iraq was heavily in debt to Kuwait; it claimed that some Kuwaiti lands historically belonged to Iraq, and also claimed that they were slant-drilling for oil across the border into Iraq's own Rumaila oil field. The Iraq army was at the time reckoned to be the fourth largest in the world, numbering one million regular soldiers and nearly 850,000 reservists. By contrast the Kuwaiti army numbered around 16,000 men. Iraq forces entered Kuwait on August 2; within 12 hours most resistance had been quashed, and on August 8, Saddam Hussein installed his cousin Ali Hassan al-Majid as Kuwait's governor. UN Secretary General Javier Perez de Cuellar met Saddam in a last-ditch attempt to prevent war, but these talks, as well as those between US Secretary of State James Baker and Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz, ended in failure. Forces allied against the Iraq invasion were gathered from 34 countries – the largest coalition since the Second World War – though the US provided nearly three-quarters of the ground troops. The build-up of US troops in Saudi Arabia from August 2, 1990 was termed Operation Desert Shield. The conflict made international figures of two of Bush's commanders - Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell and Commander of US Central Command 'Stormin" Norman Schwarzkopf. After more than a month of air attacks, the coalition's forces began a land offensive on February 24. Three days later, President Bush declared Kuwait liberated – though Saddam Hussein remained in power in Baghdad. In March 2003, Bush's son President George W. Bush led a "coalition of the willing" into an invasion of Iraq. Within a month Saddam's regime was toppled, and he himself was captured after several months in hiding. He was executed on December 30, 2006. Print this story Back to top
