From genetic information connected to health, to uncovering your origins, some of these things can come as surprises. That was the case for Robert Vanosdall. He wanted to look into his past through a 23andMe kit, and soon after, life as he knew it completely changed. Vanosdall has lived all around the country. "I was born and raised in Nebraska, after high school I started going to college and then the Iraq war was going on, so I joined the Marines," he said. He was stationed in San Diego for four years, before moving back to Nebraska to finish college. "I ended up in Illinois for a bit working as a supervisor at a manufacturing plant, which kind of brought me here, to a plant here," said Vanosdall. Landing in the Southern Tier, he thought the twists and turns in life might be over. That is, until he took a DNA test late last year. "One of the things that I found out when I took that was that I was Irish? I never knew that I had Irish in me. I always thought I was British because my mom's mother was British," he said. But finding out his ethnicity isn't the only reason Vanosdall took the test in the first place. "We have an anonymous 23 chromosomes out there and you kind of want to figure out who gave them to you," said Vanosdall. "I never knew who my biological father was. I always kind of had suspicions that it wasn't who I was being told. My mom honestly thought she knew who it was but I just had to, I wanted to find out. It was always eating at me." And what he found was a DNA match at the top of the page. His half-sister he never knew about. "I was shocked. I just didn't know what to think," he said. "I was not expecting to see a sibling on there, I never even thought about running into a sibling when I took that test. I just wanted to kind of find out who I was." They were able to connect, and the surprises don't end there. "She ended up being a triplet... that blew me away," said Vanosdall. "I've never met triplets before." There's a fourth half-sister too, all from Vanosdall's biological father. "You're always kind of wondering, is there anybody out there that shares the same perspectives or looks at the world the same?" he said. So he took the trip out to Nebraska where his siblings live. "It was amazing! It was a really good time, we had a great time, really connected, bonded really well," he said. During the visit, he got a glimpse into his father's life, and maybe his own future. "'I saw a picture of him, he was probably in his 60's at the time and it was crazy because I was like looking at a picture of myself in 30 years," he said. It's an experience that changed Vanosdall's life as he knew it, but all for the better. "It gives you a sense of euphoria, it gives you a sense of belonging, knowing who you are. It's a really good feeling," he said. Vanosdall plans on meeting up with all four of his siblings in the coming months. He also will be attending one of his sister's weddings in July with his wife and kids. Vanosdall says he recommends anyone who has questions to take a DNA test, because you never know what can come out of it!
