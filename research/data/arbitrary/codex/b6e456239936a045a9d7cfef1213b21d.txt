How graduate financial aid works Financial aid is money from the federal government, state government, or your school that can help you pay for tuition, labs, room and board, and other living expenses as you attend graduate school. It can come in these forms: Scholarships Grants Work-study Federal student loans You don't have to pay back scholarships, grants, and work-study. You will need to repay any federal loans that you take out for graduate school. To find out if you're eligible for financial aid, you need to fill out a Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA®) every year you're in your graduate program. We've partnered with Embark, the leading provider of online application and admissions software to schools and universities, to give you a free, quick, and easy way to request financial aid. Complete your FAFSA® You are now leaving salliemae.com and going to our trusted partner Embark's site. Any information you provide will be shared directly with Embark and will be covered under the terms of the Embark privacy policy. I acknowledge Julia's advice on financial aid for grad school Qualifying for graduate school financial aid The most important thing you can do to get financial aid is to fill out the FAFSA®. Your school will generally use your FAFSA® information to determine whether you're eligible for federal, state, and school aid, so it's especially important to submit it. You may be familiar with the FAFSA® from your undergraduate days. But while your parents may have filled it out previously, now it's up to you. As a graduate student, you'll be considered an independent student. That means you'll use your own financial information, rather than your parents', on the FAFSA®. There are some basic eligibility requirements for getting federal financial aid for graduate students. Complete your FAFSA® You are now leaving salliemae.com and going to our trusted partner Embark's site. Any information you provide will be shared directly with Embark and will be covered under the terms of the Embark privacy policy. I acknowledge Tips for getting graduate school financial aid Submitting the FAFSA® is free. If you're asked to pay for it, you're on the wrong website. Don't lose out on money for graduate school by missing the FAFSA® deadline. Federal financial aid is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, so apply as early as you can to maximize your aid. Applications are accepted beginning October 1 for the following academic year. Financial aid is need-based, but even if you think you won't qualify, submit the FAFSA® anyway. You risk losing out on potential aid if you don't. For an estimate of how much graduate school financial aid you may be eligible for, check out the Office of Federal Student Aid's free calculator. How to evaluate your financial aid offer After you submit your FAFSA®, you'll receive your financial aid offers from every school to which you've been accepted. Financial aid offers may not look alike, but they contain the same information: the cost of attendance and the amount of financial aid you're eligible for from all sources. The graduate schools to which you were accepted develop your financial aid offers by starting with the information you gave on your FAFSA®. Then they factor in elements like the school's estimated cost of attendance (COA) and your financial situation. When it's time for you to evaluate your graduate school financial aid offers, be sure to separate the "free" money that you don't have to pay back—scholarships, grants, and fellowships—from federal loans, which you'll have to pay back with interest. Cost of attendance and financial aid Cost of Attendance (COA) is an estimate of how much a year of graduate school will cost. If you're attending at least half time, it can include things like tuition and fees, room and board, books and supplies, transportation and personal expenses.It's one of several factors the school uses to determine how much financial aid you are eligible to receive.
