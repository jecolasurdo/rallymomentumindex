Due to the state's efficiency programs, per capita energy use has remained flat, while the rest of the US has increased by about 33 percent. Energy efficiency activities between 2010 and 2012 resulted in enough energy savings to power nearly 800,000 homes for a year and cut carbon dioxide emissions by 5.3 million tons, the equivalent of removing more than 1 million cars from California's roads. The CPUC regulates ratepayer-funded energy efficiency programs. The CPUC works with the investor-owned utilities, other program administrators, and vendors to develop programs and measures to transform technology markets within California using ratepayer funds.
