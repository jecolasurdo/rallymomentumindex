Camelback Road #100 Phoenix, AZ 85016 Arizona's #1 FHA Lender (2014) NMLS #221602 | FIMC NMLS #2289 Mortgage Mar 30 2012 Good News For Phoenix Economy and Housing by Jon Tobias in Mortgage with 0 Comments Good news for Phoenix came from a report from the Metropolitan Policy Program at Brookings. Below are keys points from the study reported by the Phoenix Business Journal. • For the fourth quarter of 2011, Phoenix's economy ranked as one of the best in the West as well as in the Top 20 of all metro areas in the study, according to the report. • Phoenix was one of five cities in the West that closed out 2011 with four consecutive months of job growth, albeit the growth slowed toward the end of the year. • Manufacturing also ticked up in Phoenix, as the region landed in the Top 40 in terms of production, and was gathering steam toward the end of the year, according to the report. Output, however, was weak, with growth of only 0.3 percent in Phoenix during the last quarter of 2011. • The report also highlights that Western cities such as Phoenix, Denver and Las Vegas all saw declines in their unemployment rates in 2011.

Many times the Lender is incompatent or the assistant or the processor; but you and your staff; Rick and Lauren that I dealt with throughout , are the MOST SOLID Lending Team I have ever worked with. Professional, knowledgable, confident, organized with a sense of urgency and ON TIME. You do not over promise and under deliver like every other Lender in the business. You own the request and make it happen. So, I commend you and your staff and will continue to filter all my clients your way! Thanks again!"Read more... Aneta S.
