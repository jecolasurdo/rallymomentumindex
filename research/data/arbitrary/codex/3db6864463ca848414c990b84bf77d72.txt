Please send the name of the organization/group, contact person, and address to: maryannhuggins@outlook.com or MaryAnn Huggins, 1915 Reading Ct. S.E., Salem, OR 97302. A cover letter with an application will be sent out to all interested organizations/groups by the end of February. All grant applications must be received no later than April 15, 2020, and the grants are awarded in June, 2020. Additionally, it is no longer necessary for the interested organization/group to be a tax exempt 501(c)(3) to be eligible for grant funds.
