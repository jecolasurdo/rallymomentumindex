We compared each card on a range of features, including cash-back rewards, annual fee, welcome bonus, introductory and standard APR, balance transfer fee and foreign transaction fees, as well as factors such as required credit and customer reviews when available.CNBC Select teamed up with location intelligence firm Esri. The company's data development team provided the most up-to-date and comprehensive consumer spending data based on the 2019 Consumer Expenditure Surveys from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. You can read more about their methodology here.Esri's data team created a sample annual budget of approximately $22,126 in retail spending. The budget includes six main categories: groceries ($5,174), gas ($2,218), dining out ($3,675), travel ($2,244), utilities ($4,862) and general purchases ($3,953). General purchases include items such as housekeeping supplies, clothing, personal care products, prescription drugs and vitamins, and other vehicle expenses.CNBC Select used this budget to estimate how much the average consumer would save over the course of a year, two years and five years, assuming they would attempt to maximize their rewards potential by earning all welcome bonuses offered and using the card for all applicable purchases. All rewards total estimations are net the annual fee.It's important to note the value of a point or mile varies from card to card and based on how you redeem them. When we calculated the estimated returns, we assumed that cardholders are redeeming cash back for a typical maximum value of 1 cent per point or mile. (Extreme optimizers might be able to achieve more value.)Our final picks are weighted heavily toward the highest five-year returns, since it's generally wise to hold onto a credit card for years. This method also avoids giving an unfair advantage to cards with large welcome bonuses.While the five-year estimates we've included are derived from a budget similar to the average American's spending, you may earn a higher or lower return depending on your shopping habits.Editorial Note: Opinions, analyses, reviews or recommendations expressed in this article are those of the CNBC Select editorial staff's alone, and have not been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by any third party.Popular Offers from CNBC Select's PartnersLearn MoreTerms ApplyNo annual fee with your paid Costco membershipCostco Anywhere Visa® Card by Citi4% cash back on eligible gas (for first $7,000/yr., then 1%)Learn MoreTerms ApplyEarn 2X points on travel and diningChase Sapphire Preferred®60,000 bonus points – worth up to $750 in travelLearn MoreTerms Apply125,000 Hilton Honors bonus point welcome offerHilton Honors American Express Surpass® CardEarn 12X Hilton Honors points at U.S. supermarkets through July 2020Learn MoreTerms ApplyBest no annual fee cash back cardCiti® Double Cash Card2% cash back (1% back when you purchase, 1% back when you pay the bill)Opinions are our own and have not been reviewed, approved, or endorsed by our advertising partnersBest CardsThe 5 best credit cards for gamers and their everyday spendingElizabeth GravierHere are the best Capital One credit cards for cash back, travel and 0% APRsAlexandria WhiteHere are the best Visa credit cards for rewards and special financingAlexandria WhiteAdvertiser DisclosureAboutContactMore from SelectCNBC.COM© 2020 CNBC LLC.
