"There are other folks who will have to have a say, including the U.S. Department of Education, including other state leaders here in South Carolina."The state was granted a waiver from standardized tests this past year from the U.S. Department of Education after schools closed in the spring to limit the spread of the coronavirus.The South Carolina news came days after Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced the state would seek a waiver on testing.Eliminating the tests for the year will give students and teachers more time during the school day and help relieve some anxiety, Spearman said."We need to relieve that as much as possible during this pandemic, as well as, it's used often for comparative information — which we did not test this previous spring — and with all of those reasons, I stand on the side of teachers," Spearman said.More:SC education leader says public needs to wear masks in order for schools to reopenSpearman made the announcement during a press conference where the state Department of Education presented its guidance for the 2020-21 school year based on a report from its accelerateEd task force.During the press conference, Spearman pleaded with the public to wear masks and social distance and said she was "extremely" concerned about the spread of the virus in the past week. Spearman said an increase in cases could jeopardize the state's ability to re-open schools in the fall, and even to have summer school in two weeks.The state broke its single-day record of coronavirus cases several times last week amid a surge in the virus, particularly in young people. Dr. Brannon Traxler, a physician and DHEC consultant, said masks would likely be necessary for most students and staff at schools. The agency is also considering testing for the virus at schools."We are certainly advocating for symptom checks and symptom reminders frequently for children," Traxler said. "We think that mask-wearing is necessary to help slow the spread of this, and so we certainly very strongly encourage and really recommend either a mask, or for teachers, there's an option of a full face shield."The final report recommends districts have the flexibility to implement various learning options, ranging from full in-person schedules to full remote learning to a hybrid of the two.South Carolina's Department of Education already has a public, virtual school primarily for high school students, but Spearman said many districts are also creating their own virtual programs.The report recommends districts announce their schedules no later than 20 days before the school year starts. Because Greenville County Schools' first day of the 2020-21 school year is Aug. 17, the district is expected to notify parents of its schedule by July 28 unless the calendar is changed.Spearman suggested districts could use teachers who are uncomfortable returning because of medical reasons to virtually teach students who also remain home.Letter to the Editor:Why teachers may be overburdened when schools reopen in the fallIncluded in the guidance are recommended protocols for schools to follow if a student or staff member tests positive for coronavirus or shows symptoms while at school.DHEC's guidance has students and staff stay home from school if they exhibit certain symptoms, and schools should designate an isolated classroom for students who start showing symptoms while on campus.DHEC recommends staff and students stay home if they exhibit: fever, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, and loss of taste or smell. The agency is also recommending students and staff stay home if they have two of the following symptoms: sore throat, muscle aches, chills, and a new or worsening cough.The full report of recommendations can be found on the state department's website, DedicationToEducation.com.
