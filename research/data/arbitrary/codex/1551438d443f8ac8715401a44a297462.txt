Ping aggregates posts from friends and artists you follow, a function similar to the social-networking features in Twitter and Facebook, and includes a new database with over 17,000 concert listings from those artists.

It also creates a custom, top 10 chart of music based on those people you follow.AP Photo/Paul Sakumahttps://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/918/516/Jobs-Unveils-Ping.jpg?ve=1&tl=1https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/918/516/A-Music-Centered-Eventl.jpg?ve=1&tl=1A Music-Centered EventThe Apple event was streamed live from Apple's website, though the "open" format Apple chose to use for the live stream (based on the new HTML5 standard) proved choppy, and was only supported in certain Apple devices, such as iPads, iPhones, and the latest version of the company's operating system, MacOS X 10.6.AP Photo/Paul Sakumahttps://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/918/516/A-Music-Centered-Eventl.jpg?ve=1&tl=1PrevNextImage 1 of 11RecommendedCoronavirusU.S.CrimeMilitaryEducationTerrorImmigrationEconomyPersonal FreedomsFox News InvestigatesWorldU.N.ConflictsTerrorismDisastersGlobal EconomyEnvironmentReligionScandalsOpinionPoliticsExecutiveSenateHouseJudiciaryForeign PolicyPollsElectionsEntertainmentCelebrity NewsMoviesTV NewsMusic NewsStyle NewsEntertainment VideoBusinessMarketsPoliticsTechnologyFeaturesBusiness LeadersLifestyleFood + DrinkCars + TrucksTravel + OutdoorsHouse + HomeFitness + Well-beingStyle + BeautyFamilyFaithScienceArchaeologyAir & SpacePlanet EarthWild NatureNatural ScienceDinosaursTechSecurityInnovationDronesComputersVideo GamesMilitary TechHealthCoronavirusHealthy LivingMedical ResearchMental HealthCancerHeart HealthChildren's HealthTVShowsPersonalitiesWatch LiveFull EpisodesShow ClipsNews Clips About Contact UsCareersFox Around the WorldAdvertise With UsMedia RelationsCorporate InformationComplianceSupplier Diversity Other Fox NationFox News ShopFox News GoFox News RadioNewslettersAlertsPodcastsApps & ProductsFacebookTwitterFlipboardGoogle+InstagramRSSEmailFox NewsNew Terms of UseUpdated Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell my Personal InformationClosed Captioning PolicyHelpContact UsAccessibility StatementThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2020 FOX News Network, LLC.
