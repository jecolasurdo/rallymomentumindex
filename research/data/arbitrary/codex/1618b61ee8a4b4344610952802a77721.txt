At the time, the scope of the threat posed by COVID-19 to Americans was misunderstood. There were no confirmed cases of community spread in Utah. But by March 14, when Chapa and her family had returned to San Antonio — the judge herself insisting on wearing gloves and a mask on the flight back that day — the dawning toll of the virus had quite literally come home.

Test results later confirmed she was infected with the highly contagious, sometimes lethal virus: one of 63 travel-related cases of COVID-19 currently reported in Bexar County, where 207 total cases have been confirmed and nine people have died. "I took all the precautions and I still became infected,” Chapa, her voice cracked and weary, said from her bedroom, where she remained on Monday with a low-grade fever more than two weeks after she first got sick. "Even if we remain cautious and follow all the recommended precautionary measures, no one is immune from this.” GOOD NEWS: Because we need more of it, submit your story and we may feature it in an upcoming article Other than some tightness in the chest, Chapa has so far avoided any severe respiratory issues that would require hospitalization. But her symptoms, and that of another San Antonian who tested positive for the virus after interacting with a recent traveler, illustrate how insidious the illness can be. Chapa's fever came creeping back four days after she seemed recovered, while another woman who contracted the virus has remained practically symptom-free. As soon as she began feeling sick, the judge isolated herself in a downstairs bedroom, away from her husband, Miguel, 47, and their three children: 5-year-old Jose; 12-year-old Natalia; and 15-year-old Luz. A signature of the virus is an alarming tendency to cluster in families, due to their close contact with each other. "The frustration has been, 'Can we all get tested too, to know if we have this thing?'” Miguel said. "And what we were told is, we're not really testing families ... I was always worried that if I get sick or one of my kids gets sick, we're all isolated upstairs, we all start falling. And how does that domino process play out?” On ExpressNews.com: Doris Wallace was a talented dressmaker and a doting grandmother. She's also San Antonio's first victim of the coronavirus outbreak. He added, "Any little symptom now, you worry.” Chapa spent a "scary” few days with a high fever, feeling extremely weak. Last week, her doctor prescribed her hydroxychloroquine, the malaria drug touted by President Trump. But the drug's strong side effects made her feel like she had "ingested poison,” she said. "I couldn't lift my head off of the pillow, was nauseous and dizzy,” she recalled. On ExpressNews.com: She was released from a hospital in San Antonio with coronavirus still in her system. Weeks later, she doesn't appear to have infected anyone. After about 11 days, Chapa began to recover. She tried to continue working remotely, answering emails from colleagues on the San Antonio-based court of appeals. Eventually, her fever subsided. But wary of CDC guidelines that COVID-19 survivors can leave isolation 72 hours after their symptoms have gone, Chapa chose to stay alone in her bedroom. The World Health Organization diverges significantly from the CDC, advising survivors to remain in isolation for 14 days after a fever dissipates. "I tend to be overly cautious, so I just remained in my room,” Chapa said. "And my husband and I agreed for the safety of my kids and everything else.” The separation was difficult. A sliding-glass door separates the judge's bedroom from a back patio, where her family ate meals and looked in on her. But Miguel, an attorney, found it challenging to work remotely while trying to help the kids with their schooling, particularly for 5-year-old Jose. "That was the difficulty for me,” Miguel said. "Quite frankly, he's the one who has fallen through the cracks. Until (the virus) kind of hits you, I wasn't taking it as seriously as I should have been. What bothered me was when people say it's only like the flu. It's not like the flu in terms of being able to bounce back.” On ExpressNews.com: Get the latest update on coronavirus and a tracking map of U.S. cases The judge's up-and-down struggle to recover has had a profound impact on her daughter Luz. "At first, everyone was kind of making a joke of it at my school,” the teenager said, "and I just thought it wasn't that big of a deal. But then as it started to reach the U.S., I started to realize this is a very serious virus that we all have to take into account. Now that my mom has it, it becomes very apparent to me that it's serious.” Chapa is glad she stayed in her room. On Sunday, about 96 hours after her fever went away, it returned, she said. "I don't want to cause alarm or concern, but every member of our community needs to know this is serious,” Chapa said. "The isolation from family has been hard, but in the long run it's for the benefit of everyone's health. We just need to stay the course, stay put and stay patient.” Like Chapa, Gabby Garcia's milder experience with COVID-19 has only left her more convinced of its danger. Garcia, 42, never would have known she was infected with the coronavirus if chance hadn't intervened. The government translator and her husband, who had recently traveled to Europe with a friend, were shopping for furniture on March 14 when they learned the friend was one of the first people in San Antonio to test positive for the virus. The family hastily canceled their plans to attend a wedding that evening. Their friend was hospitalized with pneumonia the next day, and by the following Monday, Garcia had some mild chest pain, which she often experienced with her allergies, and her husband felt fine. Workers from the Metropolitan Health District showed up to their house and donned protective gear in their driveway before collecting their samples for testing. On ExpressNews.com: San Antonio has more than 100 coronavirus cases. The actual number is likely higher. The results came back the next day: Garcia was positive, her husband negative. Garcia was shocked by her results, considering her lack of symptoms. She didn't have any of the telltale signs — fever, cough, shortness of breath — and she had only talked with the friend for a few minutes when he recently visited their house. At home, Garcia isolated herself from the rest of her family, including her children, ages 8 and 4, for about a day. But after speaking with a cousin who works as a pediatrician and a Metro Health epidemiologist, she decided the effort was fruitless. "I'm like, it doesn't seem to really make much sense for me to self-isolate because this is my family. We've been living together this whole time,” she said. "If they're going to be exposed, they're already exposed and that self-isolation isn't going to be that effective anyways.” The whole family stayed home together for two weeks. Their recommended two-week isolation period ended Tuesday. They've put off their move to a new house, as they were unable to arrange for movers during that time. While it's been alarming to watch others with the same virus become sick enough to be hospitalized, Garcia said it's also scary that in some instances "you don't freaking know you have it.” Health officials now believe that scenario could be more common than previously thought; on Tuesday, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said as many as a quarter of people who are infected with the new coronavirus may never exhibit symptoms. Cases like hers, Garcia said, only underscore the importance of taking stay-at-home orders seriously. "For the vast majority of other people, you won't know that you had it, and you won't suspect. That's why you really need to stay home and protect other people,” she said. "While it wasn't severe for me, and I feel so extremely grateful, it can affect other people and kill them. You don't want that to be on you.” Brian Chasnoff is an investigative reporter based in San Antonio.
