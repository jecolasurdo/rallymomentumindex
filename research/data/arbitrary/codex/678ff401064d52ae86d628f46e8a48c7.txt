But, in December, the FCC voted to repeal the rules. And the regulations expired on Monday.

Global growthAjit Pai, who chairs the FCC, was known to oppose net neutrality and in the past had said it was a brake on innovation.In an opinion piece published on CNET, Mr Pai in the many years of net growth before the neutrality rules "Facebook, Amazon, and Google went from small start-ups to global tech giants"."America's internet economy became the envy in the world," he said.Repealing the rules would be good for consumers, he added, because it would lift regulations that stopped some telecoms companies investing.Net neutrality looks set to live on in piecemeal form as some US states are enacting legislation that will require telecoms companies operating in their territories to abide by similar laws. Washington's law on treating data equally went into force as the federal rules expired. And three other states, California, New York and Illinois, plan to pass their own versions soon.In addition, the FCC is facing legal challenges from consumer rights groups and some state attorneys general over its decision. The US Congress also plans to debate a motion to overturn the FCC decision.
