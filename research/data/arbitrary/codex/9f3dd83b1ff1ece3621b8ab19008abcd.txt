The JBS Canada plant in Brooks, Alta., operated with just a single shift each day for a full month.

This is going to take months.” Tweet This While cattle prices have been lower because of the backlog, Laycraft said he hopes to see the system return to pre-COVID normal sometime this fall.He said there are typically fewer animals going to slaughter in the summer, which means the plants will be able to make up for lost time.
