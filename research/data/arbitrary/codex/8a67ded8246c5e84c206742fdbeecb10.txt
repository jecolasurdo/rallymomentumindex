Getty United Nations -- A new U.N. report warns "the number of human trafficking victims is on the rise" as criminal gangs and terror groups prey increasingly on women and children to make money and bolster their numbers. The 90-page Global Trafficking in Persons report says that children, who account for 30 percent of all trafficking victims, include "far more" girls than boys. Sexual exploitation is the main motivation for the trafficking, the report says, accounting for about 59 percent."The vast majority of detected victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation and 35 percent of those trafficked for forced labor are female," Yury Fedotov, Executive Director of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) wrote in the report, adding that trafficking cases overall have hit a 13-year high.

Headquarters in New York on Tuesday.Human trafficking to the United StatesThe report says the United States and Mexico are often the destinations for the victims, many of whom come from Central American countries including El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. How to spot the signs of sex trafficking "Child soldiers, forced labor, sexual slavery -- human trafficking has taken on horrific dimensions as armed groups and terrorists use it to spread fear and gain victims to offer as incentives to recruit new fighters," Fedotov said in the report.

Trump says odds of deal on wall is "less than 50-50" "Victims can be in restaurants, fisheries, brothels, farms and homes," Rani Hong told the U.N. agency, recounting his experience as a victim. He was taken from his home in India at the age of seven and eventually sold for illegal adoption in Canada and later the United States. Why the U.N. compiled the reportThe U.N. report is based on data gathered from 155 nations. Fedotov said the need for urgent action was brought to international attention by the office's Goodwill Ambassador for the Dignity of Survivors of Human Trafficking, Nadia Murad, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize last year.The award to Murad, and to Dr. Denis Mukwege, was for their work to end sexual violence as a weapon of war -- work which was highlighted in interviews with "60 Minutes." When 60 Minutes met the Nobel Peace Prize winners Murad, a member of the Muslim minority Yazidi sect, was forced into slavery and raped by ISIS terrorists after her village in Iraq was destroyed and family members killed.Simone Monasebian, Director of the New York office of UNODC, told diplomats, "a lot has been done on human trafficking, but we still have a long way to go."
