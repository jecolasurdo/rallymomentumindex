Featured Fanshot Five-star Xavier target Kris Wilkes sets visits By Joel D August 30, 2016 Official dates Illinois Sept 9th-11th UCLC Sept 22nd-25th Indiana Sept 30th- Oct 2 Xavier Oct 28th-30th Uconn November 3rd-6th ...— Kris Air Wilkes (@kadw31) August 30, 2016 Wilkes will be on campus Oct. 28-30, right on the cusp of the season's beginning. Wilkes is rumored to be interested in playing college ball with four-star guard Paul Scruggs, who is rumored to favor Xavier over Indiana and UConn right now. Rumors and speculation abound. I wish the season would start already. Xavier sets home visit with Kris Wilkes By Joel D August 25, 2016 1 comment / new Featured Fanshot Four-star 2017 forward Justin Smith to visit Xavier By Joel D August 8, 2016 1 comment / new Justin Smith visits: August 14 – Michigan September 3 – Xavier September 10 – IndianaSeptember 17 – Villanova September 30 – Stanford— guestavo (@guestavoo) August 8, 2016 As you can see, the competition for Smith is of a high level. He's a 6'7" power forward in the mold that a lot of teams are moving towards, focus more on positional flexibility than pure size. He's all pace and power in the open floor, and he finishes above the rim if he gets a path. His jumper is accurate if he has time to set his feet beyond the arc. Smith works hard at both ends; it's no mystery why so many top teams are in on him. 2017 five-star wing Kris Wilkes cuts list to 11, includes Xavier Xavier has a really good class coming together in 2017, but Wilkes would be the star. By Joel D July 31, 2016 11 comments / new Four-star 2017 G Naji Marshall commits to Xavier Welcome to X, Naji! By Joel D July 29, 2016 1 comment / new Featured Fanshot Four-star 2017 G Paul Scruggs to visit Xavier next week By Joel D July 28, 2016 '17 PG Paul Scruggs to Visit IU and XAVIER next week. Followed by MSU, Illinois and UCONN. This is the only Source for Decision/Info!!— UA Indy Hoosiers (@Indyhoosiersbba) July 29, 2016 Scruggs is one of the top players in the 2017 class, and Xavier has been on him hard. He is a strong, physical guard who slashes and scores well. He's not a great shooter, but he has a great frame and uses it well. The 2017 class could be a monster for X. Xavier '17 priority target Naji Marshall cuts list Marshall seems primed to pull the trigger very soon. By Joel D July 26, 2016 Featured Fanshot Xavier offers 2018 PG Kihei Clark By Joel D July 24, 2016 LA Rockfish's 5'9 PG Kihei Clark, receives an offer from Xavier University. Playmaking floor general, w/ vision.@LasVegasFab48— Long Live Robb Stark (@JPopeDoesThat) July 24, 2016 Clark is 5'9", but he has exceptional quickness and court vision. He gets to the middle of the defense well and makes his teammates better with his distribution. Other than his size, strength and a consistent jumper are areas of weakness for him right now. Xavier adds Florida A&M transfer Malcom Bernard Immediately eligible 6'6" guard Malcolm Bernard joins Xavier, where he'll be a valuable defensive asset and a depth option on the wings. By Joel D July 18, 2016 5 comments / new Featured Fanshot Xavier offers 2018 big man Kentrevious Jones By Joel D July 16, 2016 Thankful and blessed to receive an offer from Xavier University ‼️ #GoMusketeers pic.twitter.com/nxVjnqMtU1— BigKent (@TheReal_Bigk) July 15, 2016 Jones is a 6'10", 265-pound center out of Macon, Ga. His size alone obviously makes him a force on the glass and in the paint, but he also has good footwork around the rim. NC State, Rutgers, and Texas Tech are among those also involved. Featured Fanshot Coach Mack watching 2017 guard Elias Harden By Joel D July 14, 2016 Xavier HC Chris Mack on the sidelines watching Elias Harden #ChampionsSummerClassic— AllMetroHoops (@ehoopsshowcase) July 14, 2016 Harden is a 6'6", four-star guard. Auburn, Texas Tech, and Virginia Tech are all also involved. Featured Fanshot Xavier watching priority recruits Kris Wilkes and Paul Scruggs By Joel D July 13, 2016 #Xavier is three deep -- Chris Mack and two assistants -- sitting front row for Paul Scruggs and Kris Wilkes #LetsGoX— Terrence Payne (@terrence_payne) July 13, 2016 The Musketeers staff is really going after the 2017 top 100 pair. Wilkes is a 6'6" or so small forward who does his best work in the lane and has an expanding face-up game. Scruggs is a tough, physical guard who can really make plays going to the rim and defends like a maniac. Either of these players would be a great add for X. FAMU grad transfer Malcolm Bernard to visit Xavier Bernard led the Rattlers in almost every major statistical category last year; is he right for X? By Joel D July 13, 2016 Featured Fanshot Xavier going two deep on 2017 wings Kimani Lawrence and Jermaine Samuels By Joel D July 8, 2016 Xavier 2 deep with Chris Mack and Luke Murray for 2017s Kimani Lawrence and Jermaine Samuels.— Adam Zagoria (@AdamZagoria) July 8, 2016 Xavier has Mack and Murray watching a pair of 2017 wings.

Reeves has received an offer from Xavier. (HT @AdamFinkelstein) @ajreeves11 https://t.co/PpD6fmzs8T— Verbal Commits (@VerbalCommits) July 7, 2016 Reeves is a 6'5" shooting guard out of Massachusetts with a ton of potential. He is a strong and athletic slasher who finishes really well around the rim. His jumper is solid and developing out beyond the arc. Providence, Louisville, UConn, and URI are among other programs that have offered. Featured Fanshot Xavier's Chris Mack prioritizing Nojel Eastern By Joel D July 8, 2016 Rick Pitino continues to remain a constant presence at Brandon Randolph's games, and Chris Mack is focused on Nojel Eastern. #nikeeyb— Jeff Borzello (@jeffborzello) July 8, 2016 Eastern is a bigger (6'6") guard who is kind of a combo more than a pure 1 or 2. His shooting from deep is intermittent, but he gets into the defense well and is a good playmaker. He's an ESPN 100 player with interest from top teams from the Big East, Big Ten, and Pac 12. Featured Fanshot Xavier watching 2017 wing Jordan Nwora By Joel D July 6, 2016 Pitt, Marquette, Duke, Cal, G Tech, Xavier, Seton Hall, Memphis, Miami, L'Ville, Texas, USC, Iowa and more now watching @JordanNwora '17.— VT Academy Hoops (@VTAcademyHoops) July 6, 2016 Hooray for the July evaluation period!
