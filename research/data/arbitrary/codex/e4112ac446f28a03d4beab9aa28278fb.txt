It consists of a diverse group of over 350 senior Rhodes Scholars with collective expertise in more than forty subjects ranging from artificial intelligence to ancient art. Organizations seeking a speaker can inspect the complete list of subjects on the AARS website, www.americanrhodes.org, and then make a request by emailing speakers@americanrhodes.org. "We are fortunate to have numerous knowledgeable and accomplished individuals in our group," said Ralph Smith, AARS president, "and many of them regularly speak in their areas of expertise. What we have now done is to make that expertise available, with no speakers' fees, in a more organized way as part of the public service mission of the Rhodes Scholarship. The Speakers Bureau was started within our community last December, and now we are opening it up to the public. Our group is looking forward to adding to the public dialogue on the important issues of the day and also in more specialized areas." The Rhodes Scholarships were founded in 1902 by the Will of Cecil Rhodes and are regarded as the oldest and one of the most prestigious awards for international, post-graduate studies. The first class of American Rhodes Scholars arrived at Oxford in 1904. There are now more than 2,000 Rhodes Scholars living in the United States, including many distinguished government officials, professionals, business leaders and academics.
