WINTER HAVEN -- Three people were arrested on drug trafficking charges after Polk County sheriff's detectives say they found dozens of bags of heroin and hundreds of grams of marijuana while serving a search warrant.A fourth person was arrested on non-drug-related charges, and four children between the ages of 5 and 10 were found in the home.Arrested were Rakeem Rivers, 28, Gary Scott, 29, Andrea Kinsler, 27, and Dameshia Kinsler, 29.The Sheriff's Office said detectives were serving a search warrant at 114 Harbor Drive in Winter Haven after receiving a tip that illegal narcotics were being sold out of the residence.The total street value of the drugs seized at the home was $11,740.Detectives said they found 193 grams of marijuana in a toilet about to be flushed, along with 30 bags of heroin packaged for sale and $5,500 cash.A bag of heroin was found in Andrea Kinsler's purse. And inside Rivers' vehicle, parked on a nearby vacant lot that he also owns, was 60 grams of heroin and 420 more grams of marijuana, according to detectives.According to his arrest affidavit, Rivers admitted selling marijuana and said he was in the process of flushing it down the toilet after he heard the detectives announce they were there to serve a search warrant.He faces felony heroin and drug charges.Scott also faces felony trafficking and other drug charges.In a news release Thursday, the Sheriff's Office said that when Scott was asked about the illegal narcotics in the home, he said, "Okay, I'll take the blame for everything," and told detectives he tried to flush the heroin and weed down the toilet.Andrea Kinsler faces charges of felony heroin possession with intent to sell, and a misdemeanor paraphernalia charge. She was released on $1,500 bail.The PCSO reported that Andrea's sister, Dameshia, arrived during the search and tried to go underneath the crime scene tape to go into the house. Detectives said she was "warned numerous times" not to cross the crime scene tape, but she ignored their commands and was arrested for resisting arrest, a first-degree misdemeanor. She was released from the Polk County Jail on $500 bail.The children in the home were turned over to family members, and the Department of Children and Families was called."We often rely on the public to be our eyes and ears in the community -- and when we receive tips about suspicious activity at a house, we take them very seriously," Sheriff Grady Judd said. "Not only did we seize trafficking amounts of drugs from this house, there were children inside. Make no mistake -- we will not tolerate illegal drug trafficking in our county. We will see to it that drug dealers go to jail and are prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law."Kathy Leigh Berkowitz can be reached at kberkowitz@theledger.com or at 863-802-7558.
