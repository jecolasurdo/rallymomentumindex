I am ending my internship scared that my future internships or jobs will not meet the standards that have been set so high so early in my career." (Noor Alabdulbaqi, Science) "My experience at Wellcome has been wholly positive and inspiring. I have a science background and have found that Finance has allowed me to really understand how the Trust makes such a difference in the research community. My understanding of accounting, financial processes and controls has developed through my work on mini projects. Everybody is really committed and enthusiastic, and has made this summer enjoyable and rewarding." (Thomas Clarke, Finance) "Working for the Investments division has been truly unique – I've been able to develop my research and financial skills from working on a macro overview of India and a project on commodities exposures.
