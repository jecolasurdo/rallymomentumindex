Known as 'Sitting-Vig' to his friends, in his free time he is normally watching a film as he attempts to watch more films than anyone else. Career fields include Business, Engineering, Marketing, Legal and Healthcare The program incorporates Eurocentres online provision – focusing on language and employability skills – and a minimum four-week online virtual internship in a choice of 18 career fields. "We are now using our language training expertise to effectively prepare students for the workplace” The initiative aims to enhance the student learning experience and provide career-progression opportunities, in response to global mobility challenges created by the coronavirus pandemic, the organisations said. "We are now using our language training expertise to effectively prepare students for the workplace and provide them with high-quality placement opportunities in English-speaking host organisations around the world, making us the pathway into the workplace for international students,” Zach Holmes, CEO of Eurocentres noted. Virtual Internships – started in 2018 – was launched to meet changes in demand as the future of work approached, according to Daniel Nivern, co-founder & CEO of Virtual Internships. "More students across the world... need to prepare for remote work experience as well as create a network of virtual connections to succeed,” he said. "We are very excited to be partnering with Eurocentres, a leader in 21st-century language skills, to expand our reach to more students from more diverse backgrounds.” Earlier in 2020, Eurocentres launched its online platform, which offers "a rich learning experience for students with virtual interactive live classes, personalised tutorials and career programmes”, Holmes added. According to the providers, the Eurocentres Virtual Internship Programme augments the online provision by enabling students to apply what they have learned in a real work English-speaking environment, gain invaluable experience and improve their career prospects. Career fields include Business, Engineering, Marketing, Legal and Healthcare, where students will develop all the professional skills required to ensure long-term career success by becoming more appealing to employers, the companies added. The program also has flexible start dates with Eurocentres programs beginning weekly and the 4, 8 or 12-week internship placements starting on a fortnightly basis. Related articles Still looking?
