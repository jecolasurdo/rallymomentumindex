It recounts the incredible experiences of four average Americans who became extraordinary: Medal of Honor recipients Alvin C. York, Charles Whittlesey, and George McMurtry, whose lives converged in the saga of the Lost Battalion, and the sportswriter-turned-war correspondent Damon Runyon, who ensured their sacrifices would never be forgotten. Their experiences are set against a nation on the cusp of its greatest century, from the mean streets of New York City, to the rugged mountains of Tennessee, and the western plains. More details will follow as the project progresses. Update: Read more about my forthcoming book.
