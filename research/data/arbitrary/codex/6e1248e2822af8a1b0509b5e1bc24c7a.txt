Trump defends work habits, attacks media in series of tweets The Hill 4/26/2020 John Bowden © Getty Images Trump defends work habits, attacks media in series of tweets President Trump lashed out at the national news media over coverage of his work habits and the now-shuttered Russia investigation in a series of tweets Sunday afternoon.The president unleashed a slew of attacks apparently over an article published on Thursday detailing reports of the president's private life amid the coronavirus epidemic, a story which he labeled "a phony story" that was "written by a third rate reporter who knows nothing about me." The story was actually written by two reporters, Katie Rogers and Annie Karni."I work from early in the morning until late at night, haven't left the White House in many months (except to launch Hospital Ship Comfort) in order to take care of Trade Deals, Military Rebuilding etc., and then I read a phony story in the failing @nytimes about my work schedule and eating habits, written by a third rate reporter who knows nothing about me," he wrote."I will often be in the Oval Office late into the night & read & see that I am angrily eating a hamburger & Diet Coke in my bedroom. People with me are always stunned. Anything to demean!" Trump added.....schedule and eating habits, written by a third rate reporter who knows nothing about me. I will often be in the Oval Office late into the night & read & see that I am angrily eating a hamburger & Diet Coke in my bedroom. People with me are always stunned. Anything to demean!- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 26, 2020The people that know me and know the history of our Country say that I am the hardest working President in history. I don't know about that, but I am a hard worker and have probably gotten more done in the first 3 1/2 years than any President in history. The Fake News hates it!- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 26, 2020In a pair of tweets issued minutes later, the president went on the attack once more, this time attacking the national news media in general and stating falsely that reporters had received Nobel Prizes for their efforts."When will all of the "reporters" who have received Noble Prizes for their work on Russia, Russia, Russia, only to have been proven totally wrong (and, in fact, it was the other side who committed the crimes), be turning back their cherished "Nobles" so that they can be given to the REAL REPORTERS & JOURNALISTS who got it right," the president tweeted."When will the Noble Committee Act? Better be fast!" he added, repeating his misspelling of the Nobel Prize Committee.When will all of the "reporters" who have received Noble Prizes for their work on Russia, Russia, Russia, only to have been proven totally wrong (and, in fact, it was the other side who committed the crimes), be turning back their cherished "Nobles" so that they can be given....- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 26, 2020....Lawsuits should be brought against all, including the Fake News Organizations, to rectify this terrible injustice. For all of the great lawyers out there, do we have any takers? When will the Noble Committee Act? Better be fast!- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 26, 2020The second pair of tweets was widely mocked on Twitter over the president's repeated misspelling of "Nobel" as well as his false assertion that any journalists had been awarded by the Swedish organization for their reporting on the investigation into the Trump campaign and Russian interference in the U.S. election of 2016.
