New bill would reduce past prison sentences in Florida for the first time - News - The Florida Times-Union - Jacksonville, FL Sections NewsSportsEntertainmentLifeObitsClassifiedsHomesCarsJobse-Edition Subscribe Site Archive Log in Subscribe Now New bill would reduce past prison sentences in Florida for the first time Andrew Pantazi @apantazi Friday Feb 8, 2019 at 6:34 PM Feb 8, 2019 at 8:34 PM A new bill in the Florida Legislature would clear the way for future efforts to reduce prison populations while also offering some in prison a chance to reverse their mandatory minimums. The bill, SB 704 sponsored by Sen. Darryl Rouson, would implement last November's Amendment 11, which ended Florida's 134-year history of refusing to make sentencing reductions retroactive. The bill would automatically make any future criminal justice reforms retroactive, and it would make all past reforms, including a 2014 change to drug laws and a 2016 change to a 20-year mandatory minimum on aggravated assault, apply to people currently in prison. "Having this passed as it's written today would be one of the most, if not the most, substantial changes to the Florida criminal justice system,” said Raymer Maguire, the ACLU of Florida's criminal justice manager. "This bill, while not perfect, would be a major, major step forward for Florida.” There are no official numbers on how many people are currently in prison on outdated sentencing laws who would experience relief under this bill, but Maguire that it's at least a few hundred. But Maguire said that unlike other criminal justice reform bills, the larger impact of Rouson's proposal wouldn't be immediately felt. Instead, it would empower the Legislature to make future reforms that could drastically cut prison populations. Without Amendment 11's passage, future reforms would have only been limited to any future cases, while those currently in prison would be unaffected. "It's important to think about the reforms we're going to pass this year, the reforms we're going to pass next year and the reforms we're going to pass in five years. Getting Sen. Rouson's bill passed is key to getting these other reforms passed.” The amendment passed with 62 percent of the vote statewide. It was the only constitutional amendment sponsored by a Democrat that made it through the Constitution Revision Commission process last year. "Now for the first time, voters are saying we want you to have the power to make these reforms retroactive,” said Greg Newburn of Families Against Mandatory Minimums. Newburn helped draft Amendment 11 with Rouson, and he led the campaign to get voters to approve the initiative. "I would hope the Legislature takes that as a guide and says that they should.” "I am 100 percent confident that had the savings clause not been in the constitution in 2014 and 2016 that those reforms would have been retroactive. Now that the savings clause is not in the constitution, they should be retroactive. There's no good reason not to do this.” Until January, Florida was the only state with a constitutional ban on retroactively amending criminal statutes, according to a Constitution Revision Commission staff analysis of the amendment. That ban is sometimes called a savings clause. In 1885, Florida banned retroactive sentence reductions in its constitution. That ban has neutered past attempts to reduce the state's massive prison population. For a decade, fewer and fewer inmates have been coming into prison, but that hasn't made much of a dent into the prison population, which still had about 97,000 inmates in January, according to a state database. Prison costs are at the highest they've ever been — $2.6 billion in the current fiscal year — thanks in large part to long sentence lengths that have led to older inmates. "The hope is that the legislature will use its wisdom when outrageous or onerous sentences have been imposed,” Rouson said Friday. "I hope that the legislature will use this wisdom and apply it so that people get another chance at life. That's what this is all about.” Rouson's bill doesn't apply to the 2016 and 2017 changes to the death sentence that required unanimous jury decisions. Prior to 2016, defendants could be sentenced to death even if juries didn't unanimously agree on the sentence. That changed after a U.S. Supreme Court decision and a subsequent Florida Supreme Court opinion, but the Florida Supreme Court has only made the decision apply to sentences issued after June 2002. Some have hoped Amendment 11 could make the new death penalty rules apply to older cases and give those on death row a second chance at sentencing. "We wish we could include the death penalty,” said Gainesville Public Defender Stacy Scott. But she said she understood that the death penalty would make the bill untenable for some legislators. "We like Rouson's bill.” Since Amendment 11 passed, public defenders across the state have gotten calls from people in prison asking if their now-outdated sentences could be reduced. When Orlando Public Defender Bob Wesley heard about one past client who was still in prison 12 years after getting an aggravated assault conviction — had he been convicted today, the mandatory sentence would have been five years, not the 20 he was given — he considered asking a judge to modify the sentence under Amendment 11. But he said he became convinced that he would first have to wait for legislation like Rouson's proposed bill. "My only fear,” he said, "is the legislature will jump in to reduce minimum mandatories for drug cases but not for violent crimes.” Leah Sakala, a policy associate in the Justice Policy Center at the Urban Institute, said that cutting sentence lengths retroactively is critical to reducing Florida's incarceration rate. "It's both about being able to correct past errors but also about ensuring correctional systems evolve when thinking evolves,” she said. "We know a lot more now than we did in the '80s and '90s when a lot of important policy was put in place that has had enormous implications about the number of people in prison and who would be affected by important criminal justice decisions.” Andrew Pantazi: (904) 359-4310 Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you.
