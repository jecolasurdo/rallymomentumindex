Credit: PA The decision to delay rather than cancel this year's post-primary transfer tests is set to face a legal challenge being brought by the mother of a 10-year-old girl. One or both of two privately commissioned tests are currently used by schools that select their intake pupils on the basis of academic ability. They are provided by the Association for Quality Education and the Post-Primary Transfer Consortium. The 2020 tests, scheduled to be sat in the autumn, have been delayed by at least two weeks due to the coronavirus pandemic. AQE tests: 21 November, 28 November, 12 December 2020 PPTC tests: 5 December 2020 However, the mother contends that it is "unfair” to expect children to sit the tests after suffering so much disruption to their education. She said the situation is exacerbated for pupils of Irish language schools who plan to sit the exam in Irish. A statement from Phoenix Law noted: "With her parents already juggling siblings, work and not having a high standard of the Irish language to maintain quality of teaching at home, the young person cannot continue to learn like some other children.” The Post Primary Transfer Consortium and Education Minister Peter Weir have been named in the legal challenge. It is difficult to envisage how children will be ready for any exams in November or December when we are not even sure how or if schools will open in September. – Ciaran Moynagh, Phoenix Law The mother said her daughter has not been at school since 23 March, adding: "We do not know when the schools will reopen, however the minister and test organisers have seen fit to set a date for the new exams regardless. "They have a duty not only to educate children, but to ensure their emotional well-being and access to educational opportunity regardless of background. I do not feel their decision reflects this. "I believe my daughter, and many others, have been significantly disadvantaged which in turn is causing further unnecessary stress to the children and their parents at this already very difficult time.” Solicitor Ciaran Moynagh added: "GCSE and A-level students have been accommodated by significant shifts in approach. "Transfer test students deserve equal accommodation as these exams have an equally significant impact on a young person's prospects.” READ MORE: System to award exam grades in NI outlined Coronavirus: Everything you need to know Check the number of cases in your area with our interactive map Listen and subscribe to our podcast All the coronavirus information you need in one place - from health and work to what you can do to stop the spread of the virus Last updated Thu 14 May 2020 Education courts Coronavirus Share Tweet Reddit Advertisement Related news Belfast's Green Greek Goddess Pollen Count: Levels remaining high on Friday NI Weather: Chance of showers or thunderstorms on Friday Top stories Social distancing halved to one metre in Northern Ireland Police say search for Belfast teenager still missing person inquiry Coronavirus: No new deaths and one new case in Northern Ireland in past 24 hours Appeal after coastguard volunteer is tied up by burglars following call-out Liverpool boss praises 'inspirational' Derry Girl for on street exercises Man charged with raping woman in Belfast park Play video Independent review into RQIA board resignations announced Catch up with UTV Live Catch up with UTV programmes UTV Weather: Latest NI forecast ITV ITV2 ITVBE ITV3 ITV4 CITV ITV Presents Be on TV Mobile Signed Stories Corporate ITV Plc Jobs Press Centre ITV Media Commissioning Information Help Contact Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Notice By using this site, you agree we can set and use cookies.
