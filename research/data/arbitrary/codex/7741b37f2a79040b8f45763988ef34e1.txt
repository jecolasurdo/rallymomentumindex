Kayatta Jr. led the sharp questioning."You've got lots of qualifiable jurors in Boston. Your own data show it," he told one of the government's prosecutors. "You just need to make sure that the government doesn't cause the court to pick the wrong ones. But that's what it's sounding like you did."Kayatta later questioned how the lower court, at the government's objection, didn't allow the defense to ask certain questions of potential jurors."It's just very puzzling," he said. "You have a defendant who is clearly guilty of this heinous crime, and you then stretched and don't try to follow the rules."Tsarnaev's defense attorneys agree their client was responsible for the April 15, 2013, twin bombings at the marathon's finish-line that killed three people and injured 264 people more. But they contend that he was less culpable than his accomplice, older brother Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed by authorities following a four-day manhunt. They argued that Tsarnaev, 26, did not receive a fair trial in the city where the bombings occurred because of relentless media coverage and city-wide trauma that "filtered" into the jury pool. They said two jurors lied by concealing prejudiced remarks made on social media about the case before the trial.The appeals court adjourned without making a decision and gave no indication about when a ruling might come. Tsarnaev's lawyers have asked for a retrial of his conviction and death sentence, but because of his admission of guilt, they acknowledged any judicial action likely would apply only to sentencing. Tsarnaev, who was 19 at the time of the bombings, did not attend the hearing. Both sides received an hour to make their case. Federal prosecutor William Glaser said during the selection process that potential jurors disclosed their news sources on the bombings and the amount of information they consumed. He said a lower U.S. District Court found other questions were not relevant to determine whether jurors could set aside bias. "At the end of the day, it's not exactly what the jurors have heard or seen, but rather whether they can set aside what they have heard or seen and decide the case based on the evidence presented before them," Glaser said.Each of the 12 jurors chosen for the case confirmed they could be impartial, Glaser said. He argued the presumption of bias under the law exists only in "extreme cases," and that because the marathon bombings were an "attack on the whole country," Boston as a trial venue was fair.But U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Ojetta Rogeriee Thompson interjected: "It was acutely felt here."Tsarnaev's lawyers noted the bombings led to a "Boston Strong" city unity rallying cry.The judges pointed to the influence of statements raised by the defense from high-profile Bostonians, including then-Mayor Thomas Menino's endorsement of the death penalty for Tsarnaev, and former Boston Red Sox star David Ortiz's rallying of a crowd at Fenway Park days after the bombing."We're not talking about just individuals. We're talking about a whole community standing up," Court of Appeals Judge Juan Torruella said.Daniel Habib, Tsarnaev' attorney, pointed to the social media use of two of the jurors, who he said lied about statements during the selection process. One was the jury's forewoman, who he said concealed 22 Twitter posts mourning the victims of the bombings, praising the law enforcement officers who captured Tsarnaev and calling him a "piece of garbage.‚Äù He said she also was among residents in Boston's Dorchester neighborhood whose home was under a take-shelter order during the manhunt of the Tsarnaev brothers.Habib said another juror disobeyed court instructions when he posted on Facebook that he was a potential juror. One of his friends, according to Habib, replied that he should "play the part,‚Äù "get on the jury,‚Äù and send Tsarnaev "to jail where he will be taken care of.‚Äù"It wasn't just that they were reading the Boston Globe," and consuming other news about the bombings, Habib said, "they were listening to their family and friends, complete strangers, even social media."But while Tsarnaev's defense team noted that 69% of prospective jurors in Boston said they believed he was guilty before the trial, prosecutors countered that 38% said they would be able to put aside their opinions and review the evidence.Before his conviction, Tsarnaev's lawyers sought to move the trial to Washington, D.C., but U.S. District Judge George A. O'Toole denied the motion.Tsarnaev's defense also argued they should have been allowed to introduce evidence in the lower court tying his brother to the killings of three people in the Boston suburb of Waltham in 2011. They said it is evidence of him being the mastermind of the marathon bombings.Tsarnaev was convicted of all 30 charges against him, including conspiracy and use of a weapon of mass destruction.The three people killed in the marathon bombings were 29-year-old restaurant manager Krystle Campbell; Lingzi Lu, 26; and 8-year-old Martin Richard. MIT police Officer Sean Collier was shot and killed by the Tsarnaev brothers during the manhunt.
