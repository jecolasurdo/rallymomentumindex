Caring for Mental Health during the COVID-19 Crisis CBHI Director Lin Mei MD PhD shares information on dealing with the stressors of the pandemic. Medical experts suspect the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 may be capable of harming the brain How slowing an outbreak "flattens the curve" and can save lives. Tracking COVID-19 in the pandemic What cases are where? How many have recovered? Use the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 tracker to know the latest. CBHI's own Aasef Shaikh MD PhD named the Penni and Stephen Weinberg Chair in Brain Health at University Hospitals CBHI's own Mark Griswold PhD appointed Pavey Family Designated Professor of Innovative Imaging CBHI's own Xin Qi has received a $1M grant to advance therapies for Huntington's Disease CBHI's Jonathan Haines and colleagues study Alzheimer's disease across diverse populations. Interested in participating in the study? Check out the Genetics of Dementia enrollment page. Pasko Rakic M.D., Ph.D. Will Give the Story Landis Lecture at the 2020 CBHI Annual Meeting in August. Registration opens in April, 2020. New Research by CBHI Investigators Sheds Light on Autism and Schizophrenia. Researchers in the Mei lab in the department of Neurosciences at CWRU have found that a gene critical to clearing up unnecessary proteins plays a role in brain development, and mutations in that gene can contribute to the pathophysiology of autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia. The discovery, published Nov. 25 in Neuron, provides important insight into the mechanism of both disorders. CONGRATULATIONS to CBHI Investigators Wenquan Zou, Shu G. Chen, and colleagues who have been awarded a five year, $3.6 million grant to develop a skin based test to diagnose Parkinson's disease by detecting misfolded alpha-synuclein proteins that are hallmarks of the disease. CBHI's own James Young M.D. awarded Case Medal for Excellence in Health Science Innovation Cleveland FES Center featured in VA Research News CBHI investigators Cameron McIntyre, Aasef Shaikh, and Camila Kilbane work with the HoloLens. Martha Sajatovic appointed Rocco L. Motto Professor of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry A member of our Executive Committee, Dr. Sajatovic received this honor in September, 2019. CBHI's own Heather Broihier has earned the NIH Landis Award, which comes as no surprise to her students and trainees.... CBHI Scholars Announced The 2019 CBHI Retreat Thank you for making our second annual Retreat a success! Check out the Poster Prizes, and take a look at what we did! CBHI Physicians and brain health featured in Cleveland Magazine CBHI's own Cathy Sila M.D. is on the cover, and contributed to the magazine's article on brain health. National Institute on Aging awards $4.23 million to establish Cleveland Alzheimer's Disease Research Center The National Institute on Aging has awarded a $4.23 million grant to CBHI investigators to establish the Cleveland Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. The two-year award will support the development of a multi-institution collaborative focused on accelerating research for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. CBHI's James Leverenz, Lynn Bekris, Alan Lerner, Jonathan Haines, Mark Cohen, Brian Appleby, Martha Sajatovic, and Xiongwei Zhu will lead the effort. Get to know our Director, Lin Mei M.D., Ph.D. Neurodegeneration Study Group Debut CBHI's newest study group met for the first time at the CWRU School of Medicine on Thursday, 18 April 2019. The group, originally the AD Study Group, has been re-named in an attempt to generate content useful to all researchers working on neurodegeneration. Join us to discuss funding opportunities and meet other researchers in the field. Not sure how to find us? Check out our Parking page. T32 award renewed. CONGRATULATIONS!!! to Xiongwei Zhu Ph.D., Professor of Pathology, and the departments of Pathology, Neurosciences, Physiology & Biophysics, and Genetics & Genome Sciences at CWRU School of Medicine as they have had their T32 grant application, ”Training in Neurodegenerative Diseases,” renewed by the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke. The grant began with a successful application in 2013 by Joseph LaManna Ph.D. that supported two predoctoral candidates after successful completion of their qualifying exams. This first renewal will support three training slots for a period of five years, trained by approved trainers in each of these departments. A call for applications to fill candidate slots will be forthcoming. Think you understand how neurons communicate in the brain? Think again. Biomedical Engineers from the Case School of Engineering have described ephaptic coupling between electric fields that can produce a self-propagating wave of electrical activity. Did you know that laughter is good for your brain? It can reduce the levels of stress hormones in the blood and can mitigate the effects of stress. In a study published by the The Tohoku Journal of Experimental Medicine, researcher JongEun Yim found that "laughter decreases serum levels of cortisol, epinephrine, growth hormone, and 3,4-dihydrophenylacetic acid (a major dopamine catabolite), indicating a reversal of the stress response... " So, have you laughed today? CBHI's Johnathan Haines PhD to study AD across populations First human patient grafted with iPS cells for PD Keep up with the latest in stem cell therapy for PD. Cannabinoid exposure in adolescent brains can disrupt neural regulation Learn more about the ramifications. Kicking off the Development Study Group Check out our first meeting of the Development Study Group. We had an interactive web platform featured in our Novelty Blitz, and scientific presentations from the Mei lab. Did you know that diet can profoundly affect brain function? Learn how a ketogenic diet can reduce seizure frequency in epilepsy. Have you checked out our cbhi Study Groups? We have created six Study Groups as areas of focus within CBHI. Behavior and Cognition Cerebrovascular and Trauma Computational Neuroscience, Devices, and Imaging Development Neurodegeneration Therapeutic Interventions: Drug Development, Stem, and Progenitor Cells We also have an Investigator Initiated Group on Neuroimmunology. The Development Study Group will have monthly meetings beginning in November, 2018. Check them out! Are you interested in starting a group related to Brain Health? Contact us at cbhi@case.edu. Groundbreaking SPRINT Mind study/TEAM CBHI Investigators from Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine and University Hospitals are major contributors to the SPRINT MIND study, funded by the National Institutes of Health. The study has released preliminary data that seem to indicate that reduction of systolic blood pressure to a target 120 mm Hg (versus 130 mm Hg) may significantly reduce the risk of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and MCI and dementia (through all causes) combined. Professors at CWRU and UH who participated in the study have also spearheaded the Targeted Management Intervention (TEAM) focused at reducing stroke risk in males of African-American descent. "Our TEAM study has developed an effective behavioral intervention that can help people, especially African-Americans at high risk for stroke, get their blood pressures closer to what we know now are appropriate targets," said Martha Sajatovic MD, Director of the Neurological and Behavioral Outcomes Center at CWRU School of Medicine, and a Professor of Psychiatry at UH, who was first author of the study that appeared in the American Journal of Health Promotion. Departmental Seminars An important component of the academic life on our campuses takes place in departmental seminars. Due to the current need for social distancing, DEPARTMENTAL SEMINARS AT CWRU ARE CANCELED UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.
