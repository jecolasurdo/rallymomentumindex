The Guardian's Jamie Grierson investigates. Plus: Larry Elliott on Rishi Sunak's coronavirus budget How to listen to podcasts: everything you need to know Presented by Anushka Asthana with Jamie Grierson and Larry Elliott ; produced by Hannah Moore, Courtney Yusuf and Nicholas Cox; executive producers Nicole Jackson and Phil Maynard Wed 11 Mar 2020 23.00 EDT Last modified on Wed 18 Mar 2020 07.43 EDT Thousands of prisoners are still in jail under an abolished sentencing regime known as imprisonment for public protection (IPP). The sentences were scrapped in 2012 but not retrospectively. IPPs were introduced in 2005 to detain serious offenders who were perceived to be a risk to the public. It was estimated that around 900 would be imposed. But more than 8,000 were handed down, with consequences that some families believe have led to the deaths of their loved ones. The Guardian's home affairs correspondent Jamie Grierson has been meeting families of those who have died while serving indeterminate sentences, and tells Anushka Asthana that they are demanding answers to help prevent similar deaths. Also today: Larry Elliott on what was billed as Rishi Sunak's coronavirus budget.
