Understanding the Electoral College Local Columns Nov 27, 2016 JACK LOESCH What you will hear over the coming days, weeks, months is a call to end the practice of picking our president using the Electoral College system. Since Hillary Clinton, and previously Al Gore, garnered more votes than the eventual president, the Electoral College system will be portrayed as undemocratic, disenfranchising the voter, a relic thrust upon us by a bunch of powdered wig wearing bigots. Anyone who espouses this belief does not understand the history or the importance of this mechanism we use to select our president. To appreciate how and why we have this process, you must go back to the founding of the country. The colonists had just won an eight-year war fought to free itself from the shackles of a tyrannical government. The last thing they wanted to do is to create a strong central government that would merely emulate that which they had just escaped. Thus they devised a central government that exists at the pleasure of the states, not the other way around as we have been taught to believe. The fifty states themselves were individual sovereign entities that came together and agreed to a coalition to provide that which they cannot easily provide for themselves. In other words, the federal government only exists to perform those services the states cannot do individually. To that end, they created the Constitution placing constraints on the central government's powers. Key to this argument from the above passage is that the states "agreed” to create this government. There was a fear that the larger states — Massachusetts, New York, Virginia — would dominate the smaller states. As three fourths of the states were required to consent, the smaller states were needed to ensure constitutional ratification. Several compromises were included to placate the smaller states. Major among these was the bicameral system of the Senate and the House of Representatives with the Senate having equal representation from each state. Also included was the Electoral College to select the president. The basis for this electoral complication is that most of the nation's founders were actually afraid of democracy. Benjamin Franklin wrote: "Democracy is two wolves and a lamb voting on what to eat for lunch.” Alexis de Tocqueville dubbed it "the tyranny of the majority.” The Framers understood the dichotomy of individual rights and majority rule and struggled to find methods to diminish the contradiction. The Electoral College weighs the less populous states more heavily than the larger states. For example, the least populous state, Wyoming's three electors (two awarded because it has two senators and one for its representative), gives it a higher percentage of the Electoral College than its population warrants. Under this system, the smaller states retrain slightly more power in selecting the president than a direct popular vote would afford them. Going back to the original point that the federal government exists at the pleasure of the states and that the states are sovereign: we no longer favor this definition of our union. While secession is not practical or, as subsequent Supreme Court cases have found, even a legal remedy to an imbalance of power, tyranny of the majority is still a legitimate concern. Do we in Ohio want to be at the mercy of the citizens, and thus their political ideology, of leftist wingnuts in New York, Illinois, and California? That is exactly what the direct popular election for President would enable and the Electoral College attempts in a small way to alleviate. The Framers deliberated four months during the sweltering heat of the summer of 1787. The document that they authored was extremely insightful. We owe them the same careful deliberation when considering abandoning the plan that they conceived. We mustn't throw aside a system that has worked for two centuries just because we fail to understand why it exists in the first place.
