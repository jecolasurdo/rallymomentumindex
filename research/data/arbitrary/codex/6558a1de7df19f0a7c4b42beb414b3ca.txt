The C-47, nicknamed 'That's All Brother', is one of five Dakotas that have flown over from the US for the commemorations in France on June 6. After leading the sky transporter squadrons dropping thousands of paratroopers over France in 1944, the plane had been sold for scrap and had lain derelict in Wisconsin before being tracked down by historians. Douglas C47 Dakotas of No. 46 Group fly in formation over Wavre, Belgium, heading for the drop zones east of the River Rhine as part of Operation Varsity. Which involved more than 16,000 paratroopers and several thousand aircraft and was the largest airborne operation in history to be conducted on a single day and in one location. 24th March 1945 The aircraft was then acquired, refurbished and restored to flying condition by the Texas-based Commemorative Air Force. It has landed at Baginton Airport in Coventry for a scheduled maintenance stop after previously stopping for fuel in Scotland and Iceland. American paratroopers file along with full equipment to board their transport plane for the allied invasion of Nazi occupied Europe on D-Day. 6th June 1944. After Coventry it will fly to Duxford before making its way to Normandy for the D-Day anniversary. Many more planes will re-create scenes from D-Day, including the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight's (BBMF) own Dakota. A highlight of the commemorations will be a parachute drop by members of 16 Air Assault Brigade from the RAF Dakota over Sannerville in France. The RAF's Air Vice-Marshal Harvey Smyth said: "This will be a unique opportunity to see the RAF's BBMF Dakota operating alongside Dakotas which have flown to UK from the US for the D-Day commemorations. "It is also timely in NATO's 70th year to reflect on the strong partnership between UK and the United States – a partnership that for several decades has been the bastion of freedom in Europe and beyond.” Download the CoventryLive app Click here for iPhone and here for Android Visit our Facebook pages for Coventry and Nuneaton or visit our Twitter pages for Coventry and Nuneaton Watch our videos on YouTube and see our photos on Instagram Find old stories in our online Archives and search for jobs, motors and property, or place an advert or family notice here livecoventryFollow @live_coventryMore OnArmed ForcesCoventryRoyal Air ForceCoventry AirportBagintonWorld War II NewsallMost ReadMost RecentMoney Saving ExpertMartin Lewis issues warning to everyone with a credit cardThe Money Saving Expert spoke after a Financial Conduct Authority changeHour-by-hour weather for tomorrow as thunderstorms forecast to hit Coventry and WarwickshireweatherHeatwave will give way to showers and lightning, according to the Met Office20-minute old, £200,000 supercar wrecked in motorway crashUK & World NewsThe car stopped due to a mechanical fault and was hit from behindSix top tips to keep cool in a car without air-conditioningCoventry NewsThere is nothing pleasant about sitting in a car in the summer months as the sun's rays beat down through your windscreen.Mum's plea for fundraising as Teigan, 9, diagnosed with terminal brain tumourCoventry NewsTeigan was diagnosed with the tumour on Easter Sunday whilst her mum was 36 weeks pregnantNuneatonBoy taken to hospital after 'getting into difficulty' at water park near NuneatonThe air ambulance attended the incidentFormer Tory campaign manager in court over indecent images of children chargesCrimeMark Andrew Lerigo appeared before magistrates accused of making, distributing and possessing indecent imagesSuspected Bedworth cocaine dealer appears in courtBedworthHe appeared via video linkTeen arrested in connection with shop robberyNuneatonTwo staff were assaulted and cigarettes and alcohol were stolenHour-by-hour weather for tomorrow as thunderstorms forecast to hit Coventry and WarwickshireweatherHeatwave will give way to showers and lightning, according to the Met OfficeMost ReadMost RecentMoney Saving ExpertMartin Lewis issues warning to everyone with a credit cardThe Money Saving Expert spoke after a Financial Conduct Authority changeHour-by-hour weather for tomorrow as thunderstorms forecast to hit Coventry and WarwickshireweatherHeatwave will give way to showers and lightning, according to the Met Office20-minute old, £200,000 supercar wrecked in motorway crashUK & World NewsThe car stopped due to a mechanical fault and was hit from behindNew opening hours, football ban and more: Changes you'll notice when pubs reopenPubs in CoventryIf pubs fail to obey the new measures, they face being shut downSix top tips to keep cool in a car without air-conditioningCoventry NewsThere is nothing pleasant about sitting in a car in the summer months as the sun's rays beat down through your windscreen.Coventry City FCFormer Coventry City youngster released without making single appearance for Premier League sideGeorge Thomas came up through the ranks at the Sky Blues before joining Leicester CityBoy taken to hospital after 'getting into difficulty' at water park near NuneatonNuneatonThe air ambulance attended the incidentFormer Tory campaign manager in court over indecent images of children chargesCrimeMark Andrew Lerigo appeared before magistrates accused of making, distributing and possessing indecent imagesWhy losing defender to Coventry City would be 'a big loss' for League One clubCoventry City FCThe Sky Blues have been linked with a summer move for Sunderland centre-back Tom FlanaganHow you can get a special celebration of Coventry City's promotion to the Championship firstCoventry City FCCoventry City news | We've produced a special online souvenir of the Sky Blues' promotion featuring bonus videos and picture -
