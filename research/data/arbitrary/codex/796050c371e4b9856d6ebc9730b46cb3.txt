We are reliably informed that some unscrupulously corrupt politicians and thieving church leaders are sponsoring this new breed of e-rats of uninformed and clueless individuals hell-bent on churning out unguarded and unsubstantiated statements against IPOB since our leader started his exposition on some fake pastors and men of God in Nigeria who have refused to boldly speak up against the incessant and state sponsored killings and slaughtering of Christians in Nigeria. For the benefit of doubt and for the sake of the gullible who are susceptible to these lies, we consider it necessary at this point to put the records straight. Our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu in his life never condemned Christianity because he was raised in a Christian home by Christian parents and will never do such. He has respect for Christianity, Islam and other faith-based religions around the world. He is surrounded by Judeo-Christian faith practitioners of which he is one. His parents died professing Judeo-Christian values. Only those fake pastors who believe solely in collecting tithes and offerings in churches without looking tangibly towards improving the lives of their fellow Christians in Nigeria are the ones behind this twisted narrative. For the umpteenth time, our Leader does not hate Christianity and will never attack the faith. What he is against is the twisting of some Christian doctrines by selfish and greedy pastors to fleece their brainwashed followers. May we also use this opportunity to appeal to all those who may have misunderstood our leader as disrespecting men of God or showing no regards for Christian doctrines to disabuse their minds and understand that he is only opposed to wolves in sheeps' clothing. He still has respect for honest men of God who have not compromised their divine mandate. Again, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu is not against any Biblical injunctions practised by genuine Christians in reverence to God Almighty. It is on record and confirmed by the Nigerian 'PRESIDENCY' that IPOB and its leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu have been at the forefront of defending Christians in Nigeria more than any Christian group or pastors and men of God have ever done. IPOB spend a huge amount of money every month in highlighting the plight of persecuted Christians in Nigeria and beyond. Over 80% of the content of his messaging on Twitter @MaziNnamdiKanu is about persecuted Christians. In this digital age, the Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN) with all their resources does not have a single social media presence. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has been filling that gap for them. Our leader is unwavering in his divine assignment to liberate Biafrans and also every suffering Nigerian who wishes to be free and no amount of cheap Zoo blackmail can deter him. Therefore, everybody must support his ongoing expository effort which is a mandate from God Almighty Chukwu Okike Abiama the Elohim in Heaven. All of us shall benefit from it when this struggle is over. Our intelligence has revealed that based on these facts, Fulani terrorists in Nigeria government gathered some pastors and men of God, particularly corrupt Igbo politicians to sabotage efforts by IPOB and our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu towards Biafra restoration. The insensitive and unguarded statements by these faceless groups and individuals, no doubt sponsored by politicians and some dubious men of God are becoming so confusing to the point that one can hardly tell the difference between a man of God and a politician. While some pastors and men of God from Biafraland and other parts of the world appreciate the true gospel which our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu preaches on Radio Biafra to liberate the entire continent of Africa, these self -seeking fellows are bent on twisting the truth he speaks. Chukwu Okike Abiama the Most High God in Heaven by his infinite grace and mercy is using our leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu to educate and liberate our people from the bondage of religious confusion which some pastors are using to destroy the thinking faculties of our people in the whole of Africa for a long time now. Forming different groups to attack the great family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) is futile because God Almighty Chukwu Okike Abiama is behind us to deliver Africa and particularly Biafrans who are the bearers of the light of God with which Africans will see.

After much consideration and deliberations IPOB high command decided to urge Biafrans both home and in the diaspora, to observe this year's remembrance and celebration of our brothers and sisters who were killed and starved to death during the genocidal war on the peaceful land of Biafra by Nigeria government and her foreign allies including Britain, Egypt, USSR and Czechs Republic between 1967 and 1970, through fasting and prayers. The programme for this year's event, will last for three days from 27th to 30th of May, 2020. This year's episode and event will start with prayers and end with prayers. There will also be candle processions at every state, LGA, ward and churches in our land. It is very imperative that our people observe these great days for those who paid ultimate price and sacrificed their youthful lives for our own lives to be today. This great event will start on 27th and end on 30th of May. There won't be any sit-at-home or indoors because our people stayed much days at home during the coronavirus lockdown. IPOB wouldn't like to bother people with another lockdown in form of sit-at-home. This year's anniversary will begin with reading of Psalms of David from chapter 1 to the last chapter. Every individual and group(s) should observe this year's prayer designed to remember our fallen heroes and heroines who paid the ultimate price for our living. Nigeria government and her partners in crime decided to wipe-out the whole race but God Almighty in Heaven, 'Chukwu Okike Abiama' said no to that through these our brethren who sacrificed their lives for us to live. Therefore, IPOB families and Biafrans across countries of the world are encouraged to use this year's anniversary to pray for all our fallen heroes including all those who were killed by the overzealous Nigeria security personnel in the course of the renewed quest to restore Biafra. We shall also use this year's event to pray for divine protection of all Biafrans everywhere on the surface of the earth against the covid-19 pandemic ravaging the world. We shall also pray for the speedy recovery of all those infested with the scourge, and for immediate end of the global pandemic. COMRADE EMMA POWERFUL MEDIA AND PUBLICITY SECRETARY FOR IPOB Published by: Chibuike John Nebeokike For: IPOB Read more »     Announcement Announcement IPOB Mocks Federal Government Over Hired Faceless Attack Dog, To Defend Self, Challenge PAF For Live Address 10:29 IPOB PRESS RELEASE May 09 2020 | IPOB We the Indigenous Peoples of Biafra, IPOB, under the leadership of Mazi Nnamdi Kanu have noticed with interest, the childish attempt by the Federal Government to defend itself against the pure gospel of redemption by our leader using a faceless and non-existent group called Peace Accord Forum. The Federal Government's resort to hiring faceless and amorphous groups to defend itself against incontrovertible expositions by our leader, Mazi Nnamdi Kanu, is nothing but an undeniable sign of total defeat. We are now glad to know that the cabal running the crumbling government of Nigeria is more than ever, jittery, and on irreversible panic mode over our leader's sustained expository messages on Radio Biafra and other media platforms about the fraud going on in Nigeria. The greatest fraud of the century anywhere around the world. They have confirmed their morbid fear about the imminent collapse of their government of deceit as well as the forced marriage called Nigeria courtesy of our leader's unveiling of the truth about their fraud, hence their resort to recruiting faceless groups as their attack dogs. The charade called press release by the so-called Peace Accord Forum via its imaginary National Coordinator, Ambrose Omorodion, published in The Nation Newspapers of May 7, 2020 was a poor script by the DSS. The purported "body of Northern and Southern organisations" as claimed in the publication is nothing but a creation of the deflated DSS as there is nothing like such group anywhere in Nigeria. For the discerning minds, why did the report not have a by-line as is the tradition in authentic newspaper reports everywhere in the world if they are real? As if that was not enough blunder, why is the group losing sleep over the words of a dead man since it claims that our leader Nnamdi Kanu is dead and buried? If Kanu is dead, why bother to respond to him? We do not need to dissipate energy proving that our Leader is alive, hale and hearty as he comes live on air during his broadcasts every Wednesday and Sunday unlike the impostor acting as the Nigerian President. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu gives real time, and responds to questions during his live broadcasts, an action the hyper-reality mask wearing Buhari doubler cannot attempt. We challenge the man that claims to be the President of Nigeria to hold a live broadcast and take questions from journalists instead of the continued use of photoshopped and pre-recorded videos by the cabal and his media handlers to deceive the gullible populace but certainly not Biafrans because we are smarter. Is it not a big shame for Nigerians, about 200 million of them, that a president they claim they elected democratically cannot address them live and respond to questions by journalists in this coronavirus era when other world leaders do so almost on daily basis? Is Buhari afraid of the press or the press afraid of him? Why does he no longer hold media chat? Why has Nigeria suddenly become a country governed by press statements by the 'Presidency' instead of a President? The non-existent PAF in the purported press release, laboured in vain to diffuse the truth unveiled by our Leader concerning the wife of President Muhammadu Buhari, Aisha Buhari. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu said what would have passed as fair comment in saner societies but certainly not in the Fulani -controlled nepotistic and despotic government of Nigeria. We still stand by our Leader that Aisha Buhari, wife of the President without any budgetary provisions should be asked where she got the money she used to procure the 118 trucks of relief materials she donated to Kano State as Covid-19 palliative. Why is it that close to a month since after the death of Abba Kyari the de-facto President cum Chief of Staff to the President, a so-called President Buhari has not appointed his replacement? Today one camp of the cabal will drop a name, the next day another camp will drop a different name? Do they think that Nigerians don't reason? Well if they don't, Biafrans do, and that is why our leader is not going to stop exposing them until those in bondage are set free. Mazi Nnamdi Kanu will be live again on Sunday 10 May 2020 at 7pm GMT to continue his heaven ordained gospel of restoration of Biafra and freedom for all Nigerians. Now Aisha Buhari who had openly complained in a video that Abba Kyari's daughter locked her out of her room in Aso Rock, who fled Aso Rock for about two months claiming to be on Hajj, has suddenly taken charge of Aso Rock because the obstacle is out of the way. Our leader is not in any propaganda game but simply unravels the truth to dismantle the cabal in Aso Rock. He backs up every claim with incontrovertible evidence. He only speaks the truth nobody would dare speak, the truth Nigerians are afraid of speaking in order to educate and sensitise the people. We are grateful to God that more people are now beginning to reason like human beings and asking questions about the deceit surrounding the Nigerian Presidency. The world is now asking: 'Why is there a hole in Buhari's neck? That's why the cabal is very uncomfortable. The writer of the PAF crap called press release is an amateur and should be fired immediately by those that recruited him. Instead of puncturing our leader's points with proofs he decided to chase after the wind. For instance, his shameless and untenable claims that "Kanu is dead and buried", and that "Kanu is an impostor", only confirm the fact that he has nothing to say and is bereft of original ideas. It is a childish strategy to deflect attention away from the fraud in Aso Rock has failed. Our leader has maintained with proof that the Buhari elected in 2015 as Nigerian President was dead and buried in Saudi Arabia. He has also proved with undeniable pictorial and video evidence that the man in Aso Rock is an impostor. So, for saner minds, the so-called press release is only but 'copycat'; the writer is a lazy student. Now that the non-existent PAF has volunteered to take on our leader on behalf of the federal government, its imaginary Coordinator should in his next outing address the press live instead of dishing out garbage in the name of press release so his fellow Nigerians can know his real identity. We are not surprised that the Nigerian government and its latest recruit, PAF, wish death for our leader but Elohim the Almighty God Chukwu Okike Abiama will continue to preserve his life until Biafra is restored and transformed into the centre of excellence that heaven ordained it to be. Having realised their futile attempts to reduce the teeming followership of our leader during this live broadcast on Facebook, they have resorted to cheap, lame and baseless propaganda but they should get prepared to work harder because they will cut to pieces on Sunday. We won't relent in exposing the truth until this false contraption with faulty foundation finally collapses. COMRADE EMMA POWERFUL MEDIA AND PUBLICITY SECRETARY FOR IPOB Published by: Chibuike John Nebeokike For: IPOB Read more »     Announcement Announcement Press Release: IPOB Condemns The Dispatch of Coronavirus Infested Alamajiri To Biafra Land 05:56 IPOB PRESS RELEASE May 05 2020 | IPOB We the global family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) ably led by our great leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu wish to draw the attention of Biafrans and the world at large over the ploy by some Northern elements to export coronavirus from its Kano epicentre to other parts of Nigeria particularly Biafra land. Those behind this evil plot are currently pursuing its actualisation under the guise of repatriation of Almajiris to their home states. It is a known fact that Biafra has no Almajiri as that is not our culture. Why then are those behind the sending of Almajiri boys to Enugu doing so if not to infest Biafrans with Covid-19? No Almajiri is of Biafra origin. Why then are they being sent to Enugu? IPOB won't accept despatching of Almajiri boy to Enugu or any part of Biafra land. Arewa North dominated by Fulani have been secretly sending Coronavirus patients in the name of sending out their Almajiri group to Enugu state since the lockdown started. Some of those Almajiri sent to Enugu State but intercepted by security agents were tested and found positive of COVID-19 pandemic. Dispatching Almajiri to our land under any guise will not be accepted. We shall stoutly resist this move. It is no longer hidden that coronavirus pandemic (COVID19) is currently ravaging Kano and other parts of the North. Instead of locking down to stem the spread as was done by all states in Biafra land, Northern leaders opened their borders and allowed free movement of their people many of who are now infested with the pandemic. Now they intend to infest the rest of us with the virus under the guise of repatriation of Almajiris. We won't allow this evil plot as no Almajiri is from Biafra Land. We, therefore, urge everybody in Biafra land including politicians, businessmen and women as well as students, churches and all the stakeholders in our land to stand up and stop these evil people with their Almajiri group transferred in Biafra. Our land cannot be a depot for Almajiri. Let them stay in North where they were incubated. Everybody knows that Almajiris are wanderers causing uprising, mayhem and crises in the whole of North. Most of the attacks against Christians and Biafrans living in the North as well as Christian communities in the North have their signature tunes. We also want all Biafrans to be on the red alert because the North has devised another means of spreading this deadly disease in our land via Almajiris. They used Fulani terrorists as herdsmen, Nigeria military, police and Boko Haram attack before and failed because Biafraland is a blessed land and protected by Most High God Chukwu Okike Abiama in Heaven who is protecting and overseeing the affairs of our lives towards this deadly pandemic disease. The North knows that South East and South-South don't have Almajiri or wayward people since our lives. Therefore, they must immediately recall them before it gets too late because IPOB will not accept that nonsense transfer of human beings affected with diseases to our territory. We are not unaware about the new plans which was perfected in the north to kill Biafrans, before sending these Almajiri to Enugu we were reliably informed that Fulani would start another approach to reduce Biafra populations therefore, we'll never accept that rubbish brought here called Almajiri. Former President Goodluck Jonathan did all he could to stop and eradicate Almajiri system spread in the north during his administration. He even built schools and gave them good incentives but those who created and benefited from Almajiri institution refused and destroyed all the Almajiri schools built by Jonathan and they even accused him of destroying Northern Nigeria. Nigeria government led by Jubril Al-Sudani and his cabals in Aso Rock directed those who shared all palliatives including rice, tomatoes, beans, indomie and milk as well as money donated by Biafra sons and daughters to only people of the North without giving a single individual or group in the land of Biafra. Instead, they deemed it so imperative to bring in COVID-19 patients and Almajiri who were affected with diseases around them to our land. Our land is free from coronavirus by the power of Almighty God Chukwu Okike Abiama (God Almighty). We accuse governors, PANDEF, Ohanaeze Ndigbo led by John Nnia Nwodo of giving Fulani chances for using our land as dumping ground and it won't go through with them. Arewa political elite and elders created and groomed Almajiri for their selfish gain. Therefore, they must live with their creation because we are going to make life unbearable for them. COMRADE EMMA POWERFUL MEDIA AND PUBLICITY SECRETARY FOR IPOB. Published by: Chibuike John Nebeokike For: IPOB Read more »     Announcement Announcement Allow Free Press Coverage And Release All Detained Journalists - IPOB Orders Umahi 08:35 IPOB PRESS RELEASE April 23 2020 | IPOB The attention of the great family of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB) worldwide has been drawn to the incessant harassment, humiliation and arrest of innocent journalists in Ebonyi State since the beginning of this year 2020 by Dave Umahi. Gov. Dave Umahi has not stopped harassing and giving threatening messages to journalists in Ebonyi state over their insistence in exposing through their factual reports, the ongoing genocides and unprovoked attacks against hapless Ebonyi people by Fulani herdsmen, terrorists, and security operatives in some instances. Governor Dave Umahi and his foot soldiers in Abakaliki Government House have never hidden their sympathy for the Fulani cabals behind the mass atrocities in Biafra land including Ebonyi State just because of his selfish political ambition. It's no longer in doubt that Ebonyi State Governor Dave Umahi and his co-conspirators have been strategically supporting the humiliation and killing of Ebonyi people since he took over office in 2015. Under governor Dave Umahi's watch in Ebonyi State, journalists who believe in reporting truths are no longer safe. In the last four days Governor Dave Umahi has ordered the arrest of Sun Newspaper's Correspondent in Ebonyi state, Mr Chijioke Agwu. Not done yet, just yesterday (Tuesday) 21st of April 2020, the LGA Chairman in Ebonyi state who was acting on the instructions of Dave Umahi ordered the arrest of Mr Peter Okutu Vanguard Newspaper's Correspondent in the state. These journalists committed no crime other than exposing the atrocities of terrorists and security agents against innocent Biafrans in Ebonyi State. We, therefore want to put the world on notice how this Saboteur Governor is conniving with the enemies to suppress his own people. We equally want to remind Gov. Umahi that we have been watching and monitoring his actions. His recent antics to arrest innocent journalists for reporting the truth will not go unpunished. It remains a puzzle that Gov. Dave Umahi will turn a blind eye during Fulani herdsmen invasion as well as soldiers' and police killing of innocent people in his State only to resort to intimidation and arrest of innocent journalists for reporting the truth. We advise Dave Umahi and his agents to retrace their steps because on the day of reckoning, their slave masters in Abuja and Sokoto cannot save them. Governor Dave Umahi must stop his infamous clamp down on innocent journalists because they committed no crime against his government. It is the right and duty of journalists as the watch dog of society, to expose atrocities of both criminals and state actors for the good of all. IPOB will no longer tolerate intimidation, humiliation and arrest of innocent Biafrans including journalists and others residents for no just cause. COMRADE EMMA POWERFUL MEDIA AND PUBLICITY SECRETARY FOR IPOB. Published by: Chibuike John Nebeokike For: IPOB Read more »     Announcement Announcement IPOB warns against killing of Biafrans by Nigerian Security Operatives 12:27 IPOB PRESS RELEASE April 21 2020 | IPOB We the global family of the Indigenous People of Biafra IPOB ably led by the prophet and liberator of our time Mazi Nnamdi Kanu are unequivocally condemn the rampant and incessant harassment, humiliation and killing of innocent and unarmed citizens of Biafra in Nkpor Anambra state, Aba and Ohafia in Abia State as well as Warri Delta State. This renewal of killings in Biafraland by Fulani dominated army and police have become a norm and will soon raise catastrophe in our land and Nigeria at large. We cannot allow such barbaric killings to continue unchallenged if the perpetrators don't immediately stop this cruelty. Any soldier, police or security personnel who takes pleasure in elimination of life of any Biafran will be made to drink the cup of his wickedness. Nigeria military, Police and other security apparatus has in recent days killed more than 20 innocent citizens in Biafraland since coronavirus lockdown started. Some of the victims of this cruelty include: Mazi Ebuka Nwonye, 25, who was murdered in cold blood at Nkpor Anambra State; Mazi Promised, 46, killed at Uratta Road, Aba; Chinaemerem, also killed in Aba; and Mazi Ekene Obieze, 24, stabbed severely with dagger by Fulani soldiers and police deployed in Biafraland who are determined to reduce our population at all cost. Some victims including Mazi Ekene Obieze are still in critical conditions in the hospital. As if this is not enough, the killer squad under the guise of the police SARS, murdered in cold blood one Mazi Friday Arunsi, a middle-aged man in his home town Ebem Ohafia, Abia state that resulted to a very big uprising in Ohafia on 18th of April, 2020. It is ridiculous that Nigeria police and army personnel have abandoned their duties and resorted to chasing rats on the street of Ezego in Nkpor Anambra State and other several roads and streets in Biafraland massacring innocent and unarmed citizens with reckless abandon. We wonder why Nigeria army and police would prefer slaughtering lives of Biafrans extrajudicially during this period people facing hard time because of lockdown issued to curb the spread of coronavirus pandemic disease that is ravaging the whole world. Nigeria government in its deceptive attitude refused to give Biafrans their own share of money and food stuff during this coronavirus lockdown that is ravaging the whole world but shared palliative gifts only to the people of northern Nigeria. Biafrans were left out during this government sharing from Abuja. It is on record that the entire former Eastern region comprising the South-South and South-East zones are the economic backbone and power force of this cage called Nigeria. Nigeria government refused to include Biafrans in its Covid-19 palliative but allowed its security agents to be killing our fathers, mothers and youths who ventured to come out and look for food materials to buy for their families. Majority of Fulani terrorists were recruited into Nigeria military and police and 50% of them were deployed in Biafra to kill Biafrans. We also want to alert the world that they have, once again resumed their secret operation of searching house to house looking for IPOB members and those regarded as IPOB supporters. It is clearly open that Nigeria government led by Fulani people decided to shut down South-East and South-South to eliminate any reasonable person seen outside. It is important we inform Biafrans at home never to allow themselves to be used as escape goat or cajoled into submissions because Biafra is coming. Fulani-led government has also devised another way to force only Biafrans to accept injection of fake vaccine being distributed everywhere now. The vaccine is really contaminated with virus and disease. Our great leader Mazi Nnamdi Kanu told you this during his numerous broadcasts on radio Biafra. Therefore, no Biafran should take this contaminated vaccine to avoid the consequences. Why should Fulani-led government of Nigeria not use their Fulani people to test their vaccine? Why should soldiers intimidate our people in Mbaise Imo State and other states in Biafraland to accept vaccination? Fulani must use force on their fellow Almajiri in the North to accept the injection because they have a lot of sickness and disease in the North. With this kind of humiliation and intimidation going on now, we are urging every traditional ruler, President Generals of Town Unions (PGs), women groups and organizations, youth associations, politicians and stakeholders in every state and community in Biafra land to advise their people never to involve themselves in this vaccine they are moving around in different states particularly in Biafra land. We reject it totally. We were reliably informed how money was distributed to state governors in our land to allow and lure our people into taking this deadly vaccine. We therefore warn the compromised governors to retrace their steps before it's too late. They can't be allowed to jeopardize or sacrifice the lives of the people on the altar of politics or personal gains. A day of reckoning is fast approaching!
