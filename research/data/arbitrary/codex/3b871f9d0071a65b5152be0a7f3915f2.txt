But is that ok? Despite the UK going into lockdown on March 23 there is still some confusion over what you can and can't do - particularly when it comes down to shopping trips. The coronavirus pandemic is still ravaging the UK with the death toll now standing at more than 30,000. Shops are open for essential supplies - whether that be toilet rolls, baked beans or fresh fruit. If you're unsure of what you can, or can't do, here are the rules regarding shops, the Manchester Evening News reports. Shopping - What you can do: Buy several days' worth of food, including luxury items and alcohol Buy a small amount of a staple item or necessity (for example a newspaper, pet food, a loaf of bread or pint of milk) Read More Related Articles Major changes to Newcastle's busy roads to come after lockdown announcement Read More Related Articles Lockdown changes will be 'modest and small' as people urged to obey the rules Collect surplus basic food items from a friend Buy tools and supplies to repair a fence panel damaged in bad weather If you're out on your weekly shop, you won't stopped from browsing the "non-essential" aisles. The document adds that people have a reason to visit shops as long as they're open so it's not appropriate to stop them purchasing items considered to be "non-essentials" S hopping - What you can't do Police say it is not reasonable to pop out for DIY supplies so you can do up your kitchen, for example. However, B&Q was able to reopen as it is classified as an essential retailer. The chain has asked customers to focus on buying essential goods, implementing social distancing measures and protecting staff and services such as kitchen and bathroom design, paint mixing, timber cutting and key cutting are not available at present. It's important to remember that shops also have their own rules which you will need to follow, so check ahead of visiting.NewcastleChronicleFollow @ChronicleLiveMore OnCoronavirus NewsallMost ReadMost RecentCounty DurhamFour in a Bed contestants reveal gruelling filming schedule for 20 minute showFour in a Bed contestants have opened up about how long filming on the Channel 4 show actually takesCoronavirus LIVE updates: Outbreaks could have started in canteens and car shares; 149 UK deathsCoronavirusThe latest breaking coronavirus news and updates including deaths in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, plus UK lockdown changes, shielding guidance and daily deaths confirmationIn pictures: Thousands flock to the coast as the North East basks in sunshine North East WeatherThe North East's beaches were packed with sun-seekers on Thursday as the region enjoyed another hot day.
