Security agents searched the properties linked to New South Wales state legislator Shaoquett Moselmane, amid long-standing allegations of links to the ruling Chinese Communist Party. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation confirmed to AFP that "search warrant activity is occurring in Sydney as part of an ongoing investigation". They added that there was no "specific threat to the community." Moselmane's pro-Beijing stance has long raised eyebrows even among colleagues in the Labor Party. New South Wales Labor Party leader Jodi McKay told reporters she was informed about the operation on Moselmane's home and office and said she had begun the process of suspending his membership of the party. "It's dreadfully concerning," she said. "It's important that every MP focuses on the people in their state." Moselmane has publicly praised Xi Jinping's "unswerving" leadership during the coronavirus pandemic, contrasting it favourably with Australia's own response. Local media have reported he hired a staffer who trained at Beijing's Chinese Academy of Governance, a school of party members going into public office. The operation is another signal of Australian authorities' new willingness to tackle allegations of Chinese subversion of Australian politics and is likely to raise the temperature in an already fractious relationship between Beijing and Canberra. Last year the former head of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, Duncan Lewis, said China wanted to "take over" Australia's political system with an "insidious" and systematic campaign of espionage and influence peddling".ReutersTIMELINE-Threats and stalemate one year after Trump last met N.Korea's KimNearly one year after U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un last met, North Korea has returned to conducting short-range missile tests and issuing harsh rhetoric, while Washington shows little interest in easing sanctions. The two leaders' last meeting - at the Demilitarised Zone between the two Koreas - did little to break the deadlock in denuclearisation talks. This has led to bouts of increased tension, though Trump - who once derided Kim as "Little Rocket Man” - has largely downplayed Pyongyang's actions.The TelegraphIran explosion: Blast seen near military base in TehranIranian authorities are investigating after an explosion east of the capital near a site linked to the regime's nuclear testing programme. A bright and large flash of light was seen in the night sky over Tehran early on Friday in images shared widely on social media, Iran's Fars news agency reported. "In the early hours after midnight on Friday, a number of social media users reported seeing an orange light in the eastern part of Tehran," said Fars. "In the videos sent by (our) readers, this light is seen for a few seconds," it reported, adding it was following up the issue with the relevant authorities. Fars said later that the flash was caused by "an industrial gas tank explosion" near a facility belonging to the defence ministry.Associated PressSudan warns window closing in Nile dam dispute, asks UN helpSudan has joined Egypt in asking the U.N. Security Council to intervene in a dispute over Ethiopia's newly built hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile, warning that the window for the three countries to reach an agreement "is closing by the hour.” Sudanese Foreign Minister Asmaa Mohammed Abdalla asked the council in a letter obtained Thursday by The Associated Press to call on leaders of the three countries "to demonstrate their political will and commitment by resolving the few remaining issues and conclude an agreement” on the basis of the draft Sudan submitted June 14. Ethiopia announced last Friday that it would begin filling the huge dam's reservoir in July after last week's talks with Egypt and Sudan failed to reach an accord governing how the dam will be filled and operated.Associated PressClashes between Yemen's gov't, separatists mar ceasefireFierce fighting continued in southern Yemen between Emirati-backed separatists and the country's internationally recognized government Thursday, security officials said, a blow to the Saudi-led coalition's declared ceasefire between the factions. Battles in the flashpoint Abyan province between Saudi-backed government forces and Emirati-funded southern secessionists killed at least 54 fighters on both sides over the last 24 hours, said Yemeni security officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to brief the media. The Saudi-led coalition, which is mired in a years-long conflict with Iranian-supported rebel Houthis, said earlier this week that the separatist and government forces had reached a truce.Associated PressRace relations in Wisconsin capital are a tale of 2 citiesIn this college town that considers itself a bastion of progressive politics and inclusion, race relations are really a tale of two cities. Demonstrators who toppled statues of figures with no racist history this week say they went after the sculptures because they wanted to shatter a false narrative that the state and the city support Black people and racial equity. "The crowd at large was absolutely conscious of the political motivations,” protester Micah Le told The Associated Press in a text, referring to the statue of the Civil War abolitionist Hans Christian Heg and another sculpture of a woman with her arm outstretched that honors the state's "Forward” motto.AFPUN Security Council to meet Monday on Ethiopia damThe United Nations Security Council plans to meet Monday to discuss Egypt and Sudan's objections to Ethiopia's construction of a mega-dam on the Nile River, diplomatic sources said Thursday. The public video conference was called by the United States on behalf of Egypt, according to the sources. Ethiopia wants to start filling the reservoir for the 475-foot (145-meter) Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam in July, with or without approval from the two other countries.The TelegraphBoris Johnson faces Tory rebellion over rights of child migrants to come to the UKBoris Johnson is facing a growing rebellion from Tory MPs who want to guarantee the right of lone migrant children to seek refuge in the UK. Six Conservative MPs including former ministers Tim Loughton and Andrew Mitchell have joined with Labour to back an amendment to the immigration bill to guarantee the rights of lone migrant children to be reunited with any family legally in the UK. Yvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Committee, who tabled the amendment said: "Without urgent action, next year vulnerable lone child and teenage refugees will lose important rights to rejoin family in the UK who can care for them.” A Brexit negotiating paper released last month revealed that the UK is seeking to ditch its mandatory obligation under the so-called Dublin agreement to take in the asylum-seeking children, replacing it with a right for EU nations to "request” their transfer to join relatives in Britain. It coincided with the closure of the so-called Dubs Scheme, under which 478 unaccompanied child refugees were resettled in the UK over the course of four years. The amendment to the Immigration (EU Withdrawal) Bill would transfer the EU rule into UK law when the Brexit transition period ends. Ms Cooper said: "By January, both the Dublin and Dubs routes for child refugees to get sanctuary here will end. "The Government has said it wants family reunion for child refugees to continue but has not set up a legal framework to do it and we are running out of time. That's why we tabled the amendment.” Mr Loughton, who also sits on the Home Affairs Committee, said: "It's the right thing to do. We are often dealing with kids who have parents killed in wars and they need any relative they can to establish a link with the UK. You may find children who currently qualify no longer do after this year.” A Government spokesman said protecting vulnerable children was a key priority and more than 7,300 children had been safeguarded in the year up to March 2020 and more than 44,900 children since 2010. He said: 'In fact, last year we received the highest number of unaccompanied asylum seeking children since 2008 and more than any EU country last year. 'Protecting vulnerable children is a key priority for this government and the progress we have made – with generous support from local auAssociated PressColorado reexamines Elijah McClain's death in police custodyThe Colorado governor on Thursday ordered prosecutors to reopen the investigation into the death of Elijah McClain, a 23-year-old Black man put into a chokehold by police who stopped him on the street in suburban Denver last year because he was "being suspicious.” Gov. Jared Polis signed an executive order directing state Attorney General Phil Weiser to investigate and possibly prosecute the three white officers previously cleared in McClain's death. McClain's name has become a rallying cry during the national reckoning over racism and police brutality following the deaths of George Floyd and others.Associated PressU.S. officials change virus risk groups, add pregnant womenThe nation's top public health agency on Thursday revamped its list of which Americans are at higher risk for severe COVID-19 illness, adding pregnant women and removing age alone as a factor. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also changed the list of underlying conditions that make someone more susceptible to suffering and death. Sickle cell disease joined the list, for example.AFPUN chief: COVID-19 signals need for global approach to problemsUnited Nations (United States) (AFP) - UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres on Thursday called on the world to strengthen multilateral cooperation, saying a global approach has been the key to addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.Associated PressVirus whistleblower alleges retribution has only intensifiedA government whistleblower ousted from a leading role in battling COVID-19 alleged Thursday that the Trump administration has intensified its campaign to punish him for revealing shortcomings in the U.S. response. Dr. Rick Bright, former director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority, said in an amended complaint filed with a federal watchdog agency that he has been relegated to a lesser role in his new assignment at the National Institutes of Health, unable to lend his full expertise to the battle against COVID-19. The complaint also said that Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar is leading a "coordinated effort” to undermine Bright in his new duties, and that has led to former colleagues shunning the sidelined scientist.AFPWorld pledges $1.8 billion for crisis-stricken SudanThe international community pledged $1.8 billion at a conference to drum up support for Sudan on Thursday, in an effort to help the northeast African country battle economic woes after the ousting of long-time dictator Omar al-Bashir. "This conference opened a new chapter in the cooperation between Sudan and the international community to rebuild the country," German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said at the video conference co-organised by Germany with Sudan, the European Union and the United Nations.Associated PressAP-NORC poll: Support for restrictions, virus worries waneAfter months of steady progress, new confirmed cases of COVID-19 climbed to near record levels in the U.S. this week.

The deal, which the UAE later said involved two private companies, comes despite recent warnings from UAE officials that Israel's planned annexation of parts of the occupied West Bank would harm its efforts to improve relations with Arab states. In a speech to graduating Israeli fighter pilots, Netanyahu said an announcement was expected "in a few moments” and came after months of "intense contacts.”BBCMalawi presidential election: State broadcaster says opposition leadingOfficial results are yet to be declared but state media says Lazarus Chakwera is heading for victory.AFPRussians cast early votes in ballot to extend Putin's ruleRussians began casting early ballots Thursday in a nationwide vote on controversial constitutional reforms that could keep President Vladimir Putin remain in power until 2036.

Masks and disinfectant gels are being made available to 110 million eligible voters across 10 time zones.Associated PressWhite House punts on Israel annexation; more talks plannedPresident Donald Trump's top national security aides have been unable to reach a decision on whether to support an Israeli plan to annex significant parts of land the Palestinians claim for a future state, an impasse that could affect the timing of any action by Prime Minister Benjaimin Netanyahu. The White House said Thursday that consultations with Israeli officials will continue as they try to formulate a proposal that would support Trump's plan for an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal. The Trump administration's decision on annexation could alter America's position in the Middle East and affect Trump's election-year support with evangelical Christians, an important part of his political base.Associated PressUN food agency calls for aid to prevent another Syria exodusGrowing desperation in Syria could trigger another mass exodus unless donor countries send more funds to alleviate hunger and the international community ensures aid shipments can reach the war-ravaged country, the head of the U.N. food agency said Thursday. World Food Program Executive Director David Beasley said it's critical to keep aid flowing through border crossings, at a time when growing numbers of people are "literally on the brink of starvation.” The conference attempts to raise several billion dollars each year to alleviate the fallout from Syria's nine-year-old war, which has displaced millions of people.Associated PressDueling Trump-Biden events offer contrasting virus responsesA presidential campaign that has largely been frozen for several months because of the coronavirus took on a degree of normalcy on Thursday when President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden swung through critical battleground states presenting starkly different visions for a post-pandemic America. Touring a shipyard in Marinette, Wisconsin, Trump insisted the economy is "coming back at a level nobody ever imagined possible.” "Amazingly, he hasn't grasped the most basic fact of this crisis: To fix the economy we have to get control over the virus,” Biden said.Associated PressDeVos issues rule steering more virus aid to private schoolsThe Trump administration on Thursday moved forward with a policy ordering public schools across the U.S. to share coronavirus relief funding with private schools at a higher rate than federal law typically requires. Under a new rule issued by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, school districts are ordered to set aside a portion of their aid for private schools using a formula based on the total number of private school students in the district. The policy has been contested by public school officials who say the funding should be shared based on the number of low-income students at local private schools rather than their total enrollments.Associated PressLaw enforcement struggles with policing in reckoning momentAs calls for police reform swell across America, officers say they feel caught in the middle: vilified by the left as violent racists, fatally ambushed by extremists on the right seeking to sow discord and scapegoated by lawmakers who share responsibility for the state of the criminal justice system. The Associated Press spoke with more than two dozen officers around the country, Black, white, Hispanic and Asian, who are frustrated by the pressure they say is on them to solve the much larger problem of racism and bias in the United States. "You know, being a Black man, being a police officer and which I'm proud of being, both very proud — I understand what the community's coming from,” said Jeff Maddrey, an NYPD chief in Brooklyn and one of many officers who took a knee as a show of respect for protesters.Associated PressVirus testing, tracking still plagued by reporting delaysTest results will be expected back the next morning, before the day's practices and games begin. Having access to quick test results will play an important role in resuming sporting events, keeping businesses and factories open, and returning to school in the fall. The situation is even worse in many hot spots around the world, including South Africa, where results have sometimes taken up to 12 days.Associated PressUS health officials estimate 20M Americans have had virusU.S. officials estimate that 20 million Americans have been infected with the coronavirus since it first arrived in the United States, meaning that the vast majority of the population remains susceptible. Thursday's estimate is roughly 10 times as many infections as the 2.3 million cases that have been confirmed. Officials have long known that millions of people were infected without knowing it and that many cases are being missed because of gaps in testing.What to Read NextFighting misinformation online is 'easier than people think': Steve BallmerYahoo FinanceSad that Pride Month is ending?
