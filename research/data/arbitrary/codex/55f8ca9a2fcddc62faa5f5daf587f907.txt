New and Promising Treatments for Ulcerative Colitis SubscribeNew Treatments and Medications for Ulcerative ColitisMedically reviewed by Saurabh Sethi, MD, MPH — Written by Stephanie Watson — Updated on January 14, 2020Current treatmentsSurgeryNew drugsPossible treatmentsClinical trialsTakeaway OverviewWhen you have ulcerative colitis (UC), the goal of treatment is to stop your immune system from attacking the lining of your intestine. This will bring down the inflammation causing your symptoms, and put you into remission. Your doctor can choose from several different types of medications to help you achieve these goals.In the past few years, the number of drugs used to treat UC has increased. Researchers are studying other new and possibly improved treatments in clinical trials. Current treatmentsA few different types of medication are available to treat UC. Your doctor will help you choose one of these therapies based on: the severity of your disease (mild, moderate, or severe) which drugs you've already takenhow well you responded to those medicationsyour overall healthAminosalicylatesThis group of drugs contains the ingredient 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA). They include:sulfasalazine (Azulfidine)mesalamine (Canasa)olsalazine (Dipentum)balsalazide (Colazal, Giazo)When you take these drugs by mouth or as an enema, they help bring down inflammation in your intestine. Aminosalicylates work best for mild-to-moderate UC, and can help prevent flares.CorticosteroidsCorticosteroids (steroid drugs) suppress the immune system to bring down inflammation. Examples include:prednisoneprednisolonemethylprednisolonebudesonideYour doctor may prescribe one of these drugs short-term to calm a symptom flare. It's not a good idea to stay on steroids long-term, because they can cause problems like high blood sugar, weight gain, infections, and bone loss.ImmunomodulatorsThese drugs suppress your immune system to prevent it from causing inflammation. You may start taking one of these medications if aminosalicylates haven't helped your symptoms. Examples of immunomodulators include:azathioprine (Azasan)6-mercaptopurine (6MP) (Purinethol)cyclosporine (Sandimmune, Neoral, others)TNF blockersTNF blockers are a type of biologic drug. Biologics are made from genetically engineered proteins or other natural substances. They act on the specific parts of your immune system that drive inflammation.Anti-TNF drugs block an immune system protein called tumor necrosis factor (TNF) that triggers inflammation. They can help people with moderate-to-severe UC whose symptoms haven't improved while on other drugs.TNF blockers include:adalimumab (Humira)golimumab (Simponi)infliximab (Remicade)vedolizumab (Entyvio) SurgeryIf the treatment you've tried hasn't controlled your symptoms or stops working, you may need surgery. A procedure called proctocolectomy removes the whole colon and rectum to prevent further inflammation.After surgery, you won't have a colon to store wastes. Your surgeon will create a pouch outside your body called an ileostomy, or inside your body from part of your small intestine (ileum). Surgery is a big step, but it will relieve the symptoms of UC. New drugsIn the last few years, a few new UC treatments have emerged. Tofacitinib (Xeljanz)Xeljanz belongs to a class of medications known as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors. These drugs block the enzyme JAK, which activates cells of the immune system to produce inflammation. Xeljanz has been approved since 2012 to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and since 2017 to treat psoriatic arthritis (PsA). In 2018, the FDA also approved it to treat people with moderate-to-severe UC who haven't responded to TNF blockers. This drug is the first long-term oral treatment for moderate-to-severe UC. Other drugs require an infusion or injection. Side effects from Xeljanz include high cholesterol, headache, diarrhea, colds, rashes, and shingles.Biosimilars Biosimilars are a relatively new class of drugs that are designed to mimic the effects of biologics. Like biologics, these drugs target immune system proteins that contribute to inflammation. Biosimilars work in the same way as biologics, but they may cost much less. Four letters are added to the end of the name to help distinguish the biosimilar drug from the original biologic.The FDA has approved several biosimilars for UC in the last few years, including:infliximab-abda (Renflexis)infliximab-dyyb (Inflectra)infliximab-qbtx (Ixifi)adalimumab-adbm (Cyltezo)adalimumab-atto (Amjevita) Treatments under investigationResearchers are constantly searching for better ways to control UC. Here are a few new treatments under investigation.Fecal transplantA fecal transplant, or stool transplant, is an experimental technique that places healthy bacteria from a donor's stool into the colon of someone with UC. The idea may sound unappealing, but the good bacteria helps heal damage from UC and restore a healthy balance of germs in the gut.Stem cell therapyStem cells are the young cells that grow into all of the various cells and tissues in our bodies. They have the potential to heal all kinds of damage if we harness and use them correctly. In UC, stem cells may alter the immune system in a way that helps bring down inflammation and heal damage. Clinical trialsDoctors have a wider range of treatment options for UC than ever before. Even with so many drugs, some people have trouble finding one that works for them.Researchers are constantly studying new treatment approaches in clinical trials. Joining one of these studies can give you access to a drug before it's available to the public. Ask the doctor who treats your UC if a clinical trial in your area might be a good fit for you. TakeawayThe outlook for people with UC is much better today, thanks to new drugs that can calm intestinal inflammation. If you've tried a drug and it didn't help you, know that other options may improve your symptoms. Be persistent, and work closely with your doctor to find a therapy that ultimately works for you.
