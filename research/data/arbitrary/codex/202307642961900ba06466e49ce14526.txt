Smith that he engaged the help of Robert K. Bell, 24, of Warwick to help him find a buyer for some pills that were laced with fentanyl, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Providence.The sale resulted in the death of 27-year-old Nicholas Bateman, a construction worker who'd struggled with addiction, according to information from previously published reports and Bateman's obituary.On Thursday, Smith sentenced Bell to 32 months in federal prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release.Smith sentenced Grimaldi to serve 30 months in federal prison, also followed by three years of supervised release.According to information prosecutors presented in court, Bell set a price for the drugs and arranged for Grimaldi to meet Bateman in a West Warwick parking lot, where Grimaldi provided Bateman three pills which were marked and colored to look like oxycodone tablets. The pills were laced with fentanyl, according to the U.S. Attorney's Office.Grimaldi admitted that he watched while Batemen swallowed half of a pill. Bateman became unresponsive within minutes and was later pronounced dead at Kent County Hospital. Fentanyl was found in his bloodstream. The Rhode Island Medical Examiner determined that Bateman died as a result of the toxic effects of alcohol and fentanyl.Bateman's obituary says he "lost his well-fought struggle with addiction on Saturday, July 1, 2017."He was the "son of proud parents Craig and Janice (Mello) Bateman," and was a 2006 graduate of Old Rochester Regional High School, according to his obituary. He attended the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. Bateman was employed with the International Laborers Union Local 22 of Malden, Massachusetts, and "contributed to a number of major construction projects in Boston.""Nick enjoyed working out at the gym, making people laugh and helping others," his obituary says.U.S. Attorney Aaron Weisman said in a news release Friday, "Defendants' actions in this case ended in the gravest possible result: a young man's life tragically cut short. "The severity of this conduct, reflected by the sentences meted out in this case, reaffirms our commitment to prosecute those who profit from or share deadly illegal substances with others, and to seek the greatest measure of justice for the victims of their actions," Weisman said.jperry@providencejournal.com(401) 277-7614On Twitter: @jgregoryperry Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you.
