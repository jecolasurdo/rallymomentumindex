And at Bradley Hospital, so much of that support has come in the form of delicious meals and snacks. As our exhausted staff continues to treat the children in our care through layers of personal protective equipment and while coping with unprecedented levels of stress and anxiety, we could not be more thankful to the many friends who have stepped up with edible rewards. Kelly and Bernie Lambrese of Bristol teamed up with neighbors and beloved local restaurants Lobster Pot, Leo's, Roberto's, Le Central and DeWolf Tavern to create "Feeding the Front Line.” Through their wonderfully successful GoFundMe project, they've been feeding hundreds of Rhode Island healthcare workers – including 100+ exquisite seafood and pasta dinners for our own Bradley team. Recognizing that it isn't just clinicians caring for people with the coronavirus who need some TLC, the effort to also take care of children's behavioral health staff has taken off, starting with our friends at Feast and Fettle in East Providence who showed up on a tough day with terrific home-cooked meals. Michele and Chris Levy of Narragansett purchased 100 slices of Gregg's famous chocolate cake and drove around Rhode Island delivering them to grateful staff in Bradley residential programs. And as the holiday week of Easter/Passover came to a close, Bravo Bradley co-chair (and self-designated Easter Bunny) Tim O'Neil arrived with 250 bags of jelly beans – enough for one for each person on our program teams. That's right, a whole bag to help brighten the day! There are many others who have pitched in along the way with comfort foods and snacks of all kinds (with a few top secret family recipes mixed in). Please know how much these gestures truly help and how much better we all feel knowing so many are thinking of us. Looking ahead, we are beyond appreciative of those who have plans to keep sustaining our staff in the works. Lunches from Agawam Hunt Club and treats from Ocean State Job Lot are en route, as is more nourishment from local restaurants via FoodfortheFront.com. And if you're interested in joining this wonderful group of people putting smiles on the faces of our dedicated staff during this crisis, please reach out to Anne Morton Smith at (401) 432-1451, or asmith18@Lifespan.org.

Around the holidays, they tend to take it up a notch, and we'd like to share a few special shout-outs for Holiday Season 2019. Blesin Marquez and her husband Joe Pagnani, co-owner of Danny's Appliance Store in Providence, heard about the wonderful work happening at Bradley Hospital, and decided it was the perfect place to spread some holiday joy. Their wonderful customers contributed to a collection, Danny's Appliance matched it, and Blesin went out to personal select $2,000 in new coats, hats, gloves, undergarments, stuffed animals and toys for Bradley kids of all ages! Blesin Marquez and Joe Pagnani of Danny's Appliance with front desk supervisor Carmen Medeiros and Director of Nursing Dr. Mary Sullivan A giant thank you to Claflin, who started off our season with an amazing drive for new puzzles with employees at their headquarters in Warwick. Puzzles are a terrific way to play and learn, and our kids are grateful to take their favorites with them when they go home. Bradley staff with a plethora of puzzles from Claflin Michelle Tuttle is an aspiring fabric artist who enjoys working at FabNewport, a unique community-based non-profit maker space and learning studio. With Bradley's young people in mind, she created 12 wonderfully cushy pillows with the phrase "Dream Big” sewn into each one. A perfect comfort gift for the adolescents in our residential Bradley Center program! Fabric artist Michelle Tuttle with Fab Newport student Gianni For six years, Donny and Kyle McKendall of Massachusetts have hosted a beautiful holiday party in their home and all their friends and family bring gifts for kids on Bradley's adolescent inpatient unit. This year, in consultation with our staff, they focused on art supplies and puzzles and gifted us with 98 puzzles, 101 coloring books, 81 packs of colored pencils, 26 packs of markers, 1212 drawings pads, 7 packs of crayons and a whole bunch of other wonderful things. Puzzles and Art Supplies gifted by Donny and Kyle McKendall (below) and friends Bradley Hospital honors Joseph L. Dowling, Jr., MD with Humanitarian of the Year award at its annual meeting On October 10, friends and supporters of Bradley Hospital gathered at Agawam Hunt in Rumford for the eighth annual meeting of the Bradley Hospital Foundation Board of Trustees. Lawrence A. Aubin, Sr., chair of the Lifespan Board of Directors and the Bradley Hospital Board of Trustees, called attention to the hospital's unique position in the field of children's behavioral health and lauded its service to families, both locally and nationally. He also took the opportunity to congratulate Henry T. Sachs III, MD, on his appointment as president of Bradley Hospital. Sachs also retains the roles of chief medical officer for Bradley as well as Lifespan's medical director for child psychiatry and behavioral health. Foundation chair Lawrence B. Sadwin led a brief business meeting, during which a slate of new Trustees was presented. The audience warmly welcomed new members Kelly Lambrese, William Tracey and former Bradley Hospital president, Daniel J. Wall. Vice-chair Carol Peterson shared accomplishments from the Foundation's fiscal year, noting that fundraising for renovations to the inpatient wing's interior play-space is now complete. Dr. Henry Sachs delivered his annual state of the Hospital report, highlighting that KIDS LINK, the 24-hour children's behavioral health hotline based at Bradley, is the only such service highlighted by the CDC for its effective clinical interventions for suicide prevention in adolescents. The Bradley Hospital Humanitarian of the Year Award was given to renowned ophthalmologist Joseph L. Dowling, Jr. MD, whose seven decades of community service in Rhode Island is nothing short of remarkable. "Rhode Island is a better place to be because of Joe Dowling,” said award presenter Larry Sadwin. "Fortunately for all of us, his passion for helping others has had a monumental impact on Bradley and the lives of thousands of children and their families.” Congratulations and thank you Joe!

House Concert Raises Over $15,000 for Bradley's Healing Arts Program On August 10, 2019, Dr. and Mrs. Biswa N. Paul hosted a house concert in memory of their son Jay D. Paul at their Lincoln, Rhode Island home. The concert raised more than $15,000 to benefit Bradley Hospital's Healing Arts Program. Organized by their son Shuva, a Cincinnati attorney, the concert featured musical performances and was headlined by Srinivas Reddy (sitar) and Nitin Mitta (tabla). Reddy has toured extensively and is a visiting assistant professor of religious studies at Brown University. Rhode Island's own ATR Treehouse staged the event free of charge. Acclaimed chef and author Sanjiv Dhar, owner of popular Rhode Island restaurants including Rasoi and Kabob & Curry, generously contributed a portion of the sumptuous dinner. Apurv Gupta, MD, served as master of ceremonies for the gathering of over 60 people, who traveled from as far away as New York, New Jersey, and Ohio. Said Apurv: "The energy brought by those who came was itself healing and transformative.” Shuva's partner, Madeleine Mitchell, a professor in Cincinnati, co-organized the event. Said Madeleine, "Every penny of every donation went to the Healing Arts Program.” The Healing Arts Program, serves patients throughout the hospital and its residential programs who struggle with complex mental health conditions that co-exist with depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and developmental disabilities. Program evaluations have shown that the arts contribute significantly to the wellness of children, especially those who suffer from trauma and abuse. Bradley Hospital art therapists are trained in the creative arts, psychology and counseling, and provide one-on-one and group treatment. "Choosing the Healing Arts Program was the easiest part," said Shuva. "No one has to convince my family and friends of the value of music and art in everyday life. Supporting the Healing Arts Program is the least we can do in my brother's memory, as he had battled mental illness for more than half his life." Jay's mother, Anjali Paul, delivered the evening's closing words, "Be human,” she said. "That is the way to make others human, too.” From left: Melissa J. Weaver, art therapist at Bradley Hospital; Neel Paul, Lorelei Paul, Shuva Paul; and Bradley Hospital foundation chair Lawrence B. Sadwin. Retiring President Daniel J. Wall presented with prestigious Lifetime Achievement Award Friday, June 28, 2019 saw the end of an era at Bradley Hospital with the retirement of longtime President Daniel J. Wall. Joining the Hospital as its Director of Finance in 1988, he went on to become President in 1992. Over three decades of leadership, he presided over extraordinary growth; when he joined Bradley the hospital had 300 discharges each year, all of which were inpatient, with a small handful of outpatient clients. Today, Bradley Hospital sees more than 5,000 individual patients each year, and boasts programs at multiple levels of care, including inpatient, outpatient, intensive outpatient, partial hospitalization, group therapy, in-home treatment, residential treatment, and special education schools. The Hospital is world renowned for many of its programs, as well as for its leading-edge research. It's public health programs are credited with playing a major role in reducing the teenage suicide rate in Rhode Island. During his tenure, Wall oversaw the modernization and expansion of many areas of the Hospital, which occupies the original site and building in East Providence that opened in 1931. At a private event hosted by the Bradley Hospital Foundation Board of Trustees at the Squantum Association, Wall was presented with the prestigious Bradley Hospital Lifetime Achievement Award. There was also a little fun to be had at his expense as well as plenty of tears. Hospital leadership is now in the capable hands of Chief Medical Officer Henry T. Sachs, MD, who will serve as Interim President. Friday, June 28, 2019 saw the end of an era at Bradley Hospital with the retirement of longtime President Daniel J. Wall. Bradley Hospital Honors Humanitarians Bill and Tina Carr at Foundation Board Annual Meeting On October 11, friends and supporters of Bradley Hospital gathered for the annual meeting of the hospital's foundation board of trustees at Agawam Hunt in Rumford. Lawrence A. Aubin, Sr., chair of the Lifespan Board of Directors and the Bradley Hospital Board of Trustees, highlighted the hospital's unique position in the mental health field and lauded its service to families, both locally and nationally. Foundation chair Lawrence B. Sadwin led a brief business meeting, during which a slate of new Trustees was presented. The audience warmly welcomed Lynne Barry Dolan, Diane M. Hunter, Anthony J. Landi, Jr., Michele Levy, and Tricia S. O'Neil to the foundation board. Special guest, Rhode Island Governor Gina M. Raimondo, attended this year's annual meeting to personally join hospital leadership in honoring two extraordinary contributors to Bradley's success, Bill and Tina Carr. The couple received the 2018 Bradley Hospital Humanitarian of the Year Award at the event. "Rhode Island is a better place because Tina and Bill Carr are here,” said Governor Raimondo during her remarks. As the couple accepted their award, attendees rose to their feet and erupted in thunderous applause. Added Bradley president, Daniel J. Wall, "The children and families we care for are truly fortunate that the Carrs chose to focus the lion's share of their advocacy and personal philanthropy on advancing the mission of Bradley Hospital. It is with our deepest appreciation and thanks that we present them with this well-deserved honor.” Henry Sachs, MD, Bradley's medical director, delivered his annual state of the hospital report, including a powerful statistic: In 2018, Rhode Island has been ranked with the lowest teen suicide rate in the country. He explained that through a myriad of programs, Bradley worked hard to move the needle to that position. It had been ranked 16th just two years prior. Dan Wall returned to the podium to shine a light on the life-changing resources for children and families made possible through philanthropy and the contributions of everyone in the room, including the new Carol A. Peterson Welcome Center, the Verrecchia Clinic for children with autism and developmental disabilities, and the new co-occurring disorders programs. In addition, he noted that, "More than 130 days later, we're still celebrating the incredible success of Bravo Bradley,” recognizing 2018 event co-chairs Betty and Joe Brito.

"Play4Kids” Golf Tournament Raises More than $60,000 for Bradley Hospital and FRIENDS WAY Although rain forced the postponement of this year's "Play4Kids” Golf Tournament from its original September date, the sky was a picturesque hue of blue for 18 gorgeous holes at Ledgemont Country Club on Wednesday, October 17. Eager to hit the links in support of a great cause, enthusiastic golfers enjoyed friendly competition on beautifully-manicured fairways, coming together to raise more than $60,000 for Bradley Hospital and FRIENDS WAY, southern New England's leading bereavement program for children and adolescents. The day's program featured a moving speech by Ashley Lawrence, a Barrington High School senior who shared the story of her experience at Bradley Hospital. The young woman's experience motivated her to coordinate a fundraiser for Bradley's Healing Arts Program at Rocky Silva's American Karate this past summer, and to invite fellow students to write letters of encouragement to patients being treated in various psychiatric programs. "The Bradley partial program I was in, Journey, was a crucial element in getting me to where I am today,” said Ashley during her remarks after the tournament. "Although it was a difficult time in my life, the program made me want to get up every day, to show my inner self, and to enjoy and share my sense of humor and my smile. Not everyone may be ready to acknowledge the challenges of living with a mental illness, but I am grateful to Bradley and to FRIENDS WAY for the positive difference they're making in the lives of kids like me. I know they save lives.” During the pre-dinner cocktail hour, Lord Hobo Brewing Company joined players and guests, offering tastings of their award-winning craft beers. The 2018 "Play4Kids” Golf Tournament was made possible by title sponsor, Cox Business; awards dinner sponsor, Epic Systems; and leading sponsors Adler Pollock and Sheehan, Bill and Tina Carr, Centerville Bank, The Claflin Company, and Marcum LLP, among all of the event's generous supporters.

Kicking for Causes event raises more than $26,000 for Bradley's Healing Arts Program Bradley Hospital is honored to have been selected as the recipient of funds raised by Kicking for Causes, a non-profit fundraising and advocacy organization that engages families and children in leadership development, martial arts training, and creative fundraising in support of local charities. Led by founder Andrew Lazouras, the group recently hosted their annual fundraising event at Rocky Silva's American Karate in Seekonk, Mass., raising more than $26,000 to benefit Bradley's Healing Arts Program. Breakthroughs for Bradley: Martial Arts to Support Healing Arts combined the passion of martial arts with giving back to the community. Leading up to the event, kids and families solicited sponsorships for thousands of boards to be broken throughout the day-long fundraiser, which also featured a variety of art activities, great food, raffles, music and demonstrations. A compelling performance by Emma Cinotti of "Cuts That Spell,” a spoken word and dance piece about self-harm and depression, underscored the importance of the event to the many families in attendance. "We see kids from many different backgrounds at the studio, some with behavioral health challenges, and our mission is to work with each one individually to help build a healthy mind, body and spirit,” said Kicking for Causes founder Andrew Lazouras, who is also program director at Rocky Silva's American Karate. "Many of our families benefit from the care provided at Bradley, and we see the important parallels between our work and that of the Healing Arts program. It's a natural alliance for us.” Bradley's art therapy department and its Healing Arts Program serve patients who struggle with complex mental health conditions such as depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and developmental disabilities that co-exist with behavioral health problems. Program evaluations have shown that the arts contribute significantly to the wellness of children, especially those who suffer from trauma and abuse. Bradley Hospital art therapists are skilled mental health professionals trained in the creative arts, psychology and counseling, and provide one-on-one and group treatment. Funds contributed by Kicking for Causes will help the Healing Arts program further its reach by supporting expansion of its on-campus offerings to Bradley's residential programs. Everyone at Bradley Hospital is deeply grateful to Kicking for Causes and everyone at Rocky Silva's American Karate who made this extraordinary event possible!

John Peterson Memorial Basketball Tournament Raises More than $25,000 To close Mental Health Month, Bradley Hospital and Rhode Island Hospital hosted the first annual John Peterson Memorial Basketball Tournament on Wednesday, May 30 in the East Providence High School gymnasium. The fundraiser was held to honor the memory of John Peterson and his dedication to patients struggling with mental illness. John, who served as the director of clinical business operations at Bradley Hospital, passed away unexpectedly this past March. Prior to his untimely death, John had been collaborating with colleagues James Florio, Jr., MBA, director of psychiatry operations and business development at Rhode Island Hospital, and Michael Montella, outpatient operations analyst for Bradley and Rhode Island Hospital outpatient psychiatry, to organize a charity basketball game. Making sure John's vision became reality, the event featured a friendly – yet competitive – basketball game between colleagues from Rhode Island Hospital Adult Psychiatry and Bradley/Hasbro Children's Child Psychiatry, as well as a three-point contest with donations for every basket made during a two-minute period. In what was a nail-biter, the Adult Psychiatry team squeezed out a single-digit win on an evening that raised more than $25,000 for transportation and other support services for adult psychiatry patients, and for the healing arts programs in children's psychiatric residential settings. The night of fun and reflection attracted fans from across Lifespan behavioral health services. John was a beloved staff member at both hospitals, and friends and colleagues look forward to continuing to raise funds in his honor for programs that were of significant meaning to him. Nothing could be more fitting for this long-time basketball fan that what will now become a much-anticipated annual event.

Bradley Hospital's Annual Gala, Charting the Future, Raises Record $883,975 More than 400 guests came out to Rhodes on the Pawtuxet on Friday, June 1 in support of Bradley Hospital's 2018 Bravo Bradley gala, Charting the Future. Chaired by Betty and Joe Brito of Bristol, the signature event raised a record $883,975 to advance the pioneering pediatric mental health care, education, and research of New England's only psychiatric hospital devoted to children. Of the total raised, the event's fund-a-need generated $258,000 to support enhancements to Bradley's Compass Program, a community-based residential treatment program for girls ages 13 to 18 who are struggling with mental illness and ways to stay safe. "Thanks in large part to the incredible generosity of our donors, Bradley Hospital is truly a place of breakthroughs, healing and hope for thousands of children and families struggling with mental illness,” said Daniel J. Wall, president of Bradley Hospital. "I could not be more thankful to everyone who made this year's gala a success and who stand alongside Bradley as we heal the hearts and minds of the children who need us most.” As guests arrived at the historic venue abutting Rhode Island's largest river, they posed for souvenir photos alongside a replica 1889 Herreshoff wooden sailboat before enjoying the event's opening cocktail reception. The boat was on loan to Bradley for the evening courtesy of the Herreshoff Marine Museum of Bristol. After being welcomed into the ballroom with remarks from hospital leadership, guests were introduced to Jessica O'Connor, the 2018 USA Ambassador Miss Rhode Island Teen and a Bradley patient, who sang a moving rendition of The Dark by Beth Crowley. Shortly after, guests watched the gala's emotional video, which captured the traumatic stories of four young girls receiving treatment at Bradley's Compass Program and how the program is teaching them the skills they need to have a "life worth living.” At the conclusion of the video, Jessica returned to the podium to share her personal experience with Bradley Hospital before welcoming celebrity auctioneer Paul Zekos of The Zekos Group to present the live auction and fund-a-need. Among the auction's many exciting items, spirited bidding surrounded each package, with two experiences generating friendly competition among guests. A farm-to-table dinner for ten prepared by Chef Ben Lloyd of The Salted Slate in the comfort of the winning bidder's home sold for $15,000, while a package of four, third row center orchestra tickets to the Broadway sensation Hamilton in New York City with hotel and dinner accommodations in the heart of Times Square sold for $16,875. In returning to the stage to announce the event's fundraising total, event chairs Betty and Joe Brito put forth an unexpected philanthropic challenge, offering to match any additional donations dollar-for-dollar. The couple' generosity spurred another $40,000 in gifts, which the Britos leveraged into $80,000 for Bradley. "When families don't know where to turn, when their children are gripped by the stronghold of mental illness – or worse – Bradley is there to help,” said Joe. "Bradley Hospital is charting the future for our children and with all of us by their side, the sky is truly the limit,” added Betty. After the evening's program concluded, guests danced to the sounds of Night Rhythm Band. Bradley Hospital extends its gratitude and appreciation to Charting the Future commander sponsors, Betty and Joe Brito, and Susan and David Brown; leadership donor, Amica Companies Foundation; helmsman sponsors Carol A. Peterson, and Ocean State Job Lot Charitable Foundation, and the more than three dozen sponsors and supporters whose generosity made the event possible.

Bradley Hospital Opens Verrecchia Clinic for Children with Autism and Developmental Disabilities Thanks to an extraordinary million-dollar gift to the Every Child, Every Day campaign for Bradley and Hasbro Children's Hospitals from Al and Gerrie Verrecchia and their family, the nationally-renowned Center for Autism and Developmental Disabilities has extended its continuum of care to include a dedicated outpatient clinic. On April 10, 2018, Bradley celebrated the opening of the Verrecchia Clinic for Children with Autism and Developmental Disabilities. The service is a crucial one and timing couldn't be better: estimates show 1 in 59 children will be diagnosed with autism. And children with developmental disabilities are more than four times as likely to experience behavioral and psychiatric issues. "Families are greatly in need of specialized services to assist their children and to help them learn behavioral strategies to support them at home,” said Karen Cammuso, PhD, clinical director. "I am so pleased this new clinic can offer what they need.” The Verrecchia Clinic offers individual and family therapy, parent training in behavior management, group therapy, psychiatric evaluation, and medication management. Its clinical staff includes psychologists, social workers, a psychiatric nurse specialist, and psychiatrists. The Verrecchia Clinic team works collaboratively across the Lifespan system, including the Children's Neurodevelopment Center at Hasbro Children's Hospital. Thanks to the generosity of the Verrecchia family, their gift will allow Bradley staff to spend important time on case management, as well as specific work to assist families as they transition their children into adult care settings. It also allows the hospital to build on its legacy of autism research and breakthroughs for the future. "Children have been very good to us,” said Al Verrecchia, the former Chairman of Hasbro, Inc. "And because we have been so fortunate, it's important to us to give back to the children in our community,” added Gerrie. Since 1986, Al and Gerrie have been integral members of the Bradley and Hasbro Children's Hospital family. Their commitment to the future of every child through their generosity and leadership is an inspiration to all. Al took their commitment one step further by chairing the Every Child, Every Day campaign. Special Ocean State Job Lot Donation Brings Smiles to Bradley Hospital Patients For many of us growing up, having a favorite stuffed animal for a best buddy provided some of childhood's fondest memories. And now, thanks to Ocean State Job Lot, kids in Bradley Hospital programs can enjoy what sadly isn't a universal experience for all children. In early April, the local company generously donated a truckload of stuffed animals to be embraced by the arms of children treated at Bradley's main campus and in its residential homes. Amanda Pelletier, clinical director of the residential Compass Program, was hesitant at first to accept the oversized plush toys, thinking, "I run a house for teenage girls – not small children.” Then, she saw one of her girls hugging a giant unicorn and knew immediately it was just what they all needed. Many of the residents have endured significant trauma, including abuse and neglect, during their early childhood. "These girls didn't grow up with cozy bedrooms filled with familiar stuffed animals to help them to fall asleep at night,” she says. "When I watched each girl select their animal, name it, hug it, and carefully put it on their bed, I was reminded that the Compass Program not only provides cutting-edge treatment, we also provide a safe, comfortable home.” At the Compass Program, residents practice Dialectical Behavior Therapy, which teaches safe and effective skills to tolerate distress and regulate emotions. When residents are sad, they can practice self-soothing skills by hugging their giant, soft stuffed animal. While taking the time to focus on their senses can't make all problems go away, it can help them to feel better and more in control of their emotions. This leads to effective problem solving strategies and making healthy choices. Susan Lantz, RN, clinical nursing director of Adolescent Services, remarked that many of the children in her area have little to call their own. When the teens are discharged, they will now receive a beautiful stuffed animal to help with their transition. In the meantime, the animals are providing staff with plenty of smiles. With friends like Ocean State Job Lot helping to heal the hearts of children, it makes our work here at Bradley Hospital a little easier, and we are truly grateful! Bradley Celebrates Opening of Carol A. Peterson Welcome Center After months of diligent planning, hard work, and an outpouring of community generosity, Bradley Hospital dedicated the new Carol A. Peterson Welcome Center on Thursday, February 22. The celebration marked the completion of a $2 million renovation project that created expanded and enhanced waiting areas for children and families, as well as a new art studio for the hospital's signature Healing Arts program and a new space for training and conferences. Spearheading the effort to make the renovation possible was Carol A. Peterson, of Cranston, who made a $1 million lead gift to the project. The gift is the single largest gift received by the hospital since its founding in 1931 through the wills of George and Helen Bradley in honor of their only child, Emma Pendleton Bradley. The project was also supported generously by Tina and Bill Carr, Paula and Joe Ruggiero, and The Manton Foundation, among others. "There is no question that this is a very special moment in the history of Bradley Hospital, and one that would not have been possible without the incredible generosity of Carol and all our donors,” said Dan Wall, President of Bradley Hospital. "When families come to Bradley filled with anxiety and fear, a bright and welcoming area helps let them know they've come to the right place.” Bradley's main lobby was last renovated four decades ago, when annual discharges were just 300 patients, all of whom were there on an inpatient basis. Today, the hospital sees more than 5,000 children and families annually, through seven different levels of care and many unique programs. Combine that with what is arguably the most popular academic training program for child psychiatry in the country and an outstanding department of behavioral education, and the hospital's volume of traffic far exceeded its capacity. "The transformation of this space sends an incredibly powerful message,” added Wall. "As Carol has said many times, Bradley's lobby is essentially our front door to the public. The new Carol A. Peterson Welcome Center is just that. We've put out a beautiful welcome mat that tells families they've arrived at a place of hope.” Grateful for Bradley's Care, Family Makes Gift in Daughter's Memory In 2015, Gloria Ormonde Rodrigues established the Tiffani Ormonde Memorial Fund to honor the life of her daughter, Tiffani, who was a longtime Bradley Hospital patient. The Foundation's mission is to raise funds to support programs that helped Tiffani during her life and continue to benefit patients today. Last November, Tiffani's family and friends hosted the 4th annual Tiffani Ormonde Memorial Fundraiser at the Rhode Island Shriners Hall in Cranston. Featuring a ranch-themed party and exciting auction, enthusiastic guests dressed in their finest western-wear raised $9,000 to benefit the Center for Autism and Development Disabilities (CADD). Earlier this winter, Bradley was honored to host Gloria, and her extended family and friends, for a check presentation and luncheon with the CADD staff who deliver the outstanding care that helped Tiffani thrive. Our entire staff remembers Tiffani with great affection. "We were all so fond of Tiffani — that her family remembers her in this beautiful way is very touching,” said Margaret Klitzke, MD, CADD Unit Chief. "We are so grateful to the family for their generosity, which will have a tremendous impact on the experience of children while they're in our care.” Cardz for Kidz Help Lift Spirits of Bradley Hospital Patients in More Ways than One Few things have the ability to brighten a child's day more than receiving a greeting card and knowing someone is thinking of you. Sadly, the stigma of mental illness may be what keeps many from sending get well cards to kids when they're in the hospital for a psychiatric issue. But thanks to Cardz for Kidz, Bradley patients are receiving cards filled with inspirational messages that bring a smile to their face. Founded by Ike Nwankwo and based in Chicago, Cardz for Kidz is dedicated to uplifting the spirits of hospitalized and traumatized children across the globe by delivering cards handmade by volunteers. For the past year, Bradley has been honored to be a Cardz for Kidz site, with patients having received hundreds of beautiful cards. The cards arrive for holidays and every day enjoyment, and offer inspiring messages like, "You're incredible,” "I believe in you,” and "There's only one you!” They come in a variety of languages, and often feature pop-outs, stickers, and even crayons and pictures to color. The response from Bradley patients has been amazing, with some wanting to give their cards to fellow patients when they leave the hospital. "It's incredibly heartwarming to see how much the kids enjoy the cards,” said Nicole Nappi, RN. For Ike, who had his own difficult hospital experience when he was younger, it's important that he knows the cards are making a difference. "The staff at Bradley has made sure we know the impact the cards are having on the kids—it means the world to our volunteers, and to me,” he said. To celebrate the partnership, Cardz for Kidz recently raised funds to purchase a GOKart, a new mobile gaming console, for the Bradley inpatient units. Together, Ike and Jared Richter from Gamers Outreach in Ann Arbor, Michigan, creators of GOKart, traveled to Bradley to present the gift. As an added bonus, they arrived with a big envelope stuffed with new cards! We are thrilled to have the first GOKart in Rhode Island, and are truly grateful to Cardz for Kidz for making it possible.

Brings Global Day of Joy to Bradley Hospital The December holiday came early for patients at Bradley Hospital when twenty-eight employees from Hasbro, Inc. visited the hospital during the company's 5th annual "Global Day of Joy” celebration. Throughout the festive day, these ambassadors of cheer played games with patients on all four inpatient units, as well as the OCD partial and children's partial units. Laughter emanated down each hallway as children and adults alike enjoyed some of Hasbro's most popular (and messy) games, such as Pie Face and Egged On. Best of all, the generous toy company provided tons of toys for patients to choose from and keep. Before the day came to an end, Tom Courney, Hasbro, Inc.'s Chief Operating Officer, joined in the fun—stopping by to donate hundreds of fidget spinners as the toy company's personal thank you to Bradley employees. As always, a fun time was had by all and we are grateful for the wonderful holiday cheer! Bradley Annual Meeting Celebrates Hospital's Banner Year Annual meeting keynote speaker Gabby Pascale is presented with flowers from Foundation Board Chair Lawrence B. Sadwin. On the heels of what was the busiest summer in the 86-year history of Bradley Hospital, friends and supporters of the country's first psychiatric hospital devoted exclusively to children and adolescents gathered for the Annual Meeting of the Bradley Hospital Foundation. The event was held on October 12 at the Squantum Association in East Providence. Right: Keynote speaker Gabby Pascale is presented with flowers from Foundation Board Chair Larry Sadwin. The evening began with remarks by Lawrence A. Aubin, Sr., Chair of the Lifespan Board of Directors and the Bradley Hospital Board of Trustees, who highlighted the hospital as the system's key to being able to provide truly comprehensive care to children. And in his annual State of the Hospital report, Henry Sachs, MD, Bradley's Chief Medical Officer, shared that even with the constancy of full capacity throughout the hospital, Bradley achieved a patient satisfaction score of 99 percent. Foundation Board Chair Larry Sadwin led a brief business meeting, during which the slate of officers and directors for the upcoming fiscal year were presented. New members include Betty Brito, Rick Granoff, and Mehdi Khosrovani. John Robitaille was thanked for his many years of service to Bradley, and will continue as a member of the Board of Governors. New members of the Board of Governors include Edward and Christine Caron, Sixcia Devine, Jason and Annette Grant, Rosemary Khosrovani, Tim and Tricia O'Neil, and Deborah Tate. Bradley president Dan Wall acknowledged the extraordinary commitment of Bradley Hospital friends and supporters, and marveled at the momentum presently underway on the Foundation Board. He reported that the lobby project currently in progress would be open by 2018, and expressed special thanks to leading donors, including Carol Peterson, who led the fundraising effort with a million-dollar gift, along with Bill and Tina Carr, Joe Ruggiero, and the Manton Foundation. The Bradley Hospital Lifetime Achievement Award was presented to Gregory K. Fritz, MD, a leader in various roles since joining the staff in 1985, including chief medical officer and then academic director since 2007. He is currently president of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, and is retiring from both positions this fall. Even with the wonderful tribute to the much beloved Dr. Fritz, the true highlight of the evening was the keynote, delivered by Gabby Pascale, a ten-year-old Bradley patient and advocate for children's mental health. A student at Winsor Elementary School in Johnston, Pascale organized a mental health awareness day and walk against stigma, raising funds for the PediMIND research program run by Daniel Dickstein, MD. Pascale brought down the house with her unwavering delivery, stating, "I am strong, and all the kids you help here are strong. We all fight every day and we should be proud. We should talk about it more. I want no child to be afraid to talk about how they feel—I hope they shout it out loud, all these terrible things they feel, and show people how wonderful it is that they got up today anyway.” L-R: Daniel J. Wall, President; Thomas F. Anders, MD, Past President and Foundation Board Member; Gregory K. Fritz, MD; and Lawrence B. Sadwin, Foundation Board Chair. Bradley Hospital's "Play4Kids” Golf Tournament Raises More than $60,000 Olivia Deaton with Bradley Hospital President Daniel J. Wall After rain washed out the September date for this year's Bradley Hospital "Play4Kids” Golf Tournament, the skies smiled on Tuesday, October 17, offering up a gorgeous day for golf and good cheer at Ledgemont Country Club. Nearly 100 golfers enjoyed eighteen holes under a picturesque blue sky, coming together to raise more than $60,000 for Bradley Hospital and FRIENDS WAY, Southern New England's only bereavement program for children and adolescents. The event's program was punctuated by a moving speech by Olivia Deaton, a Barrington High School senior who shared her experience of losing a friend to suicide. Olivia's grief moved her to create a foundation to raise funds to fight the stigma of mental illness and support critical treatment programs, in the hopes of helping more young people avoid the fate of her dear friend. "All of you here are doing so much more than playing golf or donating money—you are helping change kids' lives,” said Olivia during her remarks. "Because you care, you are helping to prevent kids from suffering the same fate as Devin, and you are helping kids like me become stronger. I could never tell you how much that means to me and to all of the people you are helping.” Title sponsor, Cox Business; gold sponsor RICOH; and silver sponsors The Claflin Company and Marcum LLP, among the event's more than two dozen supporters, made the 2017 "Play4Kids” Golf Tournament possible.
