"As we've had to adapt to new ways of living, the 'must-have' trends or the 'in-season' pieces feel very obsolete,” she says. "We've been forced to take a look at what really matters in our lives and, for some, fashion doesn't have as strong of a hold on our priorities as it once did.”Instead, as many across the country traded suits for loungewear or fancy dresses for laid-back athleisure wear, she's seen fashion this summer turning to freedom: Wear what makes you happy. "Gone are the days of excessive buying and hoarding of garments that end up in landfills,” she says. "I think that tie-dye, crochet, neon and statement sleeves are trends that are uplifting, colorful, fun and can provide some escapism or optimism for better days ahead.
