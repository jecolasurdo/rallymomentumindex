No one wants to avoid all of the calorie-packed favorites, but choosing Thanksgiving dishes that also provide a few nutritional benefits will help keep your waistline in check.

Eating sweet potatoes regularly can also help reduce the risk of breast cancer in women by 25%, according to a study by Harvard Medical School.

We can tell you -- loads of butter and plenty of assorted high-fat meats. One scoop can have up to 550 calories. Instead, replace the butter with low-sodium chicken broth. Then your stuffing won't leave you feeling as, well... stuffed.

Aside from being an excellent source of protein, studies show that turkey can also boost the immune system and aid in healing processes. Gobble up!

Studies show that it provides little nutritional value, merely adding calories to everything it touches.Hide Caption 5 of 9 Photos: Say 'Thanks' or 'No thanks' to these Thanksgiving dishesSay 'Thanks' to green beans – Green beans alone are one of the healthiest Thanksgiving foods. Research shows that they are an excellent source of vitamin C and antioxidants. But be careful with green bean casseroles -- adding canned soup, butter and cream can bring an extra 200 to 300 calories and should have you saying "No thanks" instead.Hide Caption 6 of 9 Photos: Say 'Thanks' or 'No thanks' to these Thanksgiving dishesSay 'No thanks' to dinner rolls – A hot, buttery dinner roll may be tempting -- and let's be honest, you'll want more than one -- but fight the temptation and escape from hundreds of calories. Choose your carbs carefully by looking for whole grains; many premade rolls are highly processed, which should only make your decision to say "No thanks" easier. Hide Caption 7 of 9 Photos: Say 'Thanks' or 'No thanks' to these Thanksgiving dishesSay 'Thanks' to pumpkin pie – Pumpkin is a good source of fiber and vitamin A and promotes healthy vision, mucus membranes and skin. That said, say your thanks and cut yourself a slice of pumpkin pie. It is the holidays after all! Hide Caption 8 of 9 Photos: Say 'Thanks' or 'No thanks' to these Thanksgiving dishesSay 'No thanks' to pecan pie – Although pecans themselves are good for the heart, plop them in a pie and you could eat more 500 calories and 27 grams of fat in a single slice. Holidays are made for indulgence, but after a typical Thanksgiving meal, the last thing you should do is to top it off with a high-calorie dessert like this.
