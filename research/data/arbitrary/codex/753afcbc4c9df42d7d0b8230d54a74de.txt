Former first ladies Rosalynn Carter, Barbara Bush, Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan and then-Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton gather at a Betty Ford Center anniversary on Jan. 17, 2003. AP Photo/Reed Saxon, File America's first ladies have rich histories to rival their commander-in-chief husbands.Edith Wilson basically ran the government after her husband had a stroke; Grace Coolidge had a pet raccoon; and Melania Trump speaks six languages.Continue to learn facts about each first lady, from Martha Washington to Melania Trump.Visit Insider's homepage for more stories. The 41 women who have followed their husbands to the White House to become America's first ladies may have lived lives overshadowed by their partners.But these women each have a unique story to tell — filled with tragedy, joy, and often accomplishments unusual for women of their time.James Buchanan was the only bachelor president, but a few presidents' wives didn't act as official first ladies, or didn't live to see their husband's become presidents, so we've excluded them here. Sometimes first daughters or sisters acted as the official hostess, or no one filled the role.Here are the most interesting little-known facts about the small club of women who have called 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. home. Martha Washington Martha Washington Hulton Archive/Getty Images The nation's first first lady stayed by her husband's side during much of the Revolutionary War. General George Washington often asked her to join him at his winter encampment, and thought it so necessary that she be there that he "sought reimbursement from Congress for her traveling expenses," according to the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association. Abigail Adams Stock Montage/Getty Images John and Abigail Adam's love letters are world famous, but she also had a sweet correspondence with another president, Thomas Jefferson.Thomas Jefferson and John Adams became friends when they were both sent to Europe as American diplomats shortly after the Revolutionary War, but other the years their political differences caused them to fall out.However, when then-President Jefferson's daughter Polly died in 1804, Abigail immediately wrote to him to express her sadness at the loss.There would be other periods when Abigail and Jefferson didn't talk after that, but they were on speaking terms at the end of Abigail's life.In January 1817, a little less than a year before Abigail's death, Jefferson wrote her a letter saying "our next meeting must then be in the country to which [time] has flown, — a country for us not now very distant." Dolley Madison Gilbert Stuart/Wikimedia Commons President James Madison's wife may be credited with instilling the importance of bipartisanship in US politics.According to the New York Historical Society, Dolley Madison would invite members of different political parties to her social functions, at a time when tensions between parties were so high that debates could often devolve into physical violence and even duels.Her parties stressed civility and encouraged cooperation, in part thanks to the presence of women. Elizabeth Monroe Elizabeth Monroe, the wife of James Monroe, served as first lady from 1817 to 1825. John Vanderlyn/Wikimedia Commons Before becoming first lady in 1817, Elizabeth Monroe followed her husband — the country's future fifth president — to France, where he was appointed United States Minister under George Washington.The Monroes lived in France during the height of the French Revolution, and Elizabeth is credited with saving the Marquis de Lafayette's wife from execution at the guillotine. Louisa Adams Louisa Adams Hulton Archive/Getty Images The first foreign-born first lady was, perhaps unsurprisingly, one of the most well traveled.Louisa Adams was born to a British mother and an American father in London, where she later met her future husband, John Quincy Adams. She didn't move to America until four years after their marriage.Louisa spent much of her union following John around to his different diplomatic postings, from Berlin to Russia — but always felt most at home in her husband's native New England. Anna Harrison anna harrison Library of Congress Anna Harrison was the first first lady to be widowed while her husband was in office. President William Henry Harrison died a month after catching a cold at his inauguration. His wife was still in the process of packing up to join him in Washington when she learned of his death.She lived to be 88. Letitia Tyler Mrs. John Tyler, head-and-shoulders portrait, facing front was first lady between 1941 and 1942 Library of Congress Letitia Tyler was the first first lady to die while her husband was in office, at the age of 51 in 1842. Her death also made her the youngest first lady to ever die. Julia Tyler Julia Tyler john tyler's second wife Harris & Ewing / Library of Congres Julia Tyler was the first first lady to marry her husband while he was a sitting president, when she tied the knot with President John Tyler two years after his first wife's death. There was some criticism of the marriage at the time, due to the couple's 30-year age difference. Sarah Polk Bettmann via Getty After her husband President James K. Polk's four years in office, the couple retired to their home, "Polk Place," in Nashville, where he died in 1849.Sarah lived at the home for the rest of her life, standing her ground even when the Civil War broke out in 1861, and fighting came to Tennessee. Polk Place was considered neutral ground by both armies, and the former first lady is said to have entertained both Union and Confederate leaders at her house during this period. She too lived to age 88. Peggy Taylor Margaret Taylor, who was married to Zachary Taylor, was first lady from 1849 to 1850. Wikimedia Commons While her husband was away fighting in the Mexican War, Peggy Taylor made an oath with herself that if he came back alive, she would never go out into society again. She continued to hold that vow when her husband became president in 1849, relegating all social duties at the White House to her youngest daughter, Mary Elizabeth. Abigail Fillmore Library Of Congress/Getty Images Abigail Fillmore is sometimes credited with establishing the White House's library, but the National First Ladies Library casts doubt on this claim. She was, however, an avid reader and keen observer of the political happenings of the time, acting as an unofficial adviser to her husband. The couple amassed a personal library of more than 4,000 books. Jane Pierce Jane Pierce first lady 1886 J.C. Buttre/Library of Congress Like many other first ladies, Jane Pierce was not exactly excited to fill the position.

Julia Grant Julia Grant. Kean Collection/Getty Images Julia Grant was the first former first lady to write a memoir, blazing the way for similar books from the likes of Laura Bush and Michelle Obama, according to the History Channel. But it wasn't published until nearly 75 years after her death. Lucy Hayes Lucy Hayes. AP Photo Lucy Hayes was the first first lady to graduate from college. Her time as first lady is perhaps best known for banning alcohol from the White House, which earned her the nickname "Lemonade Lucy," according to the History Channel. Lucretia Garfield Lucretia Garfield between 1860 and 1870 Library of Congress Moving into a White House made dry by her predecessors, Lucretia Garfield ignored pressure from the temperance movement and reversed the policy not to serve alcohol, according to the History Channel.

Caroline Harrison Library of Congress/Corbis/VCG via Getty Images Caroline Harrison served as the founding president general of the Daughters of the American Revolution, an organization whose members can trace their ancestry to those who aided in the Revolutionary War.She also helped raise money for Johns Hopkins University medical school, but only on the condition that they let women in. Ida McKinley PhotoQuest/Getty Images Ida Saxton met her future husband while working as a cashier at her father's bank in Canton, Ohio, and the two appeared to share a deep love.When he was shot by an assassin in September 1901, his first thoughts went to his wife."My wife — be careful how you tell her — oh be careful," he told his secretary.

Ellen Wilson Ellen Wilson. Topical Press Agency/Getty Images While her husband, future President Woodrow Wilson, was teaching at Bryn Mawr College in Pennsylvania during her first pregnancies, Ellen Wilson insisted on going home to Georgia to give birth so that her children would not be born Yankees.But she didn't embrace some of the darker aspects of the South. The descendant of slave owners, she worked to improve housing conditions in black slums.Her time as first lady was short lived, as she died in August 1914, about a year-and-a-half into her husband's presidency. Edith Wilson Edith Wilson. Hulton Archive/Getty Images President Woodrow Wilson married Edith Axson a little less than a year after the death of his first wife, Ellen. Edith Wilson has sometimes been called the "first woman to run the government" since she took over a lot of her husband's responsibilities when he suffered a stroke in 1919 that left him partially paralyzed. Florence Harding Bettmann via Getty Images President Warren G. Harding was Florence Kling's second marriage, after her first husband — whom she married at 19 — left her after she gave birth to their son.Though she was born into privilege as the daughter of the wealthiest man in Marion, Ohio, proud Florence refused to move back home and went to work to make rent. Grace Coolidge National Archives First lady Grace Coolidge caused somewhat of a scene at the 1927 White House Easter Egg Roll, when she brought along the family's pet raccoon, Rebecca.According to the History Channel, Rebecca clawed at the first lady and some children before she had to be taken back to to her quarters for safety.The Coolidges adopted Rebecca when a Mississippi resident sent the animal to the White House as a Thanksgiving table offering. The president decided to pardon the raccoon instead of killing it for meat, and it quickly became one of his fondest companions.

She also learned Latin and Mandarin Chinese. Eleanor Roosevelt Eleanor Roosevelt at an event in New York, New York Sept. 24, 1942 John Rooney/AP Photo Orphaned at a young age, Eleanor Roosevelt was walked down the aisle on her wedding day by then-President Teddy Roosevelt, her uncle.

"I wanted to play tennis. I wanted to swim and my hair turned, as I'm sure someone else will tell you, orange, green, yellow, depending upon how much chlorine in the pool. So I decided to go white." Hillary Clinton Cynthia Johnson/Getty Images Hillary Clinton met her husband, future President Bill Clinton, when they were both law students at Georgetown University.

"It was the first time that I had prayed to God for something, begged him for something, not the simple childhood wishing on a star but humbly begging for another human life. And it was as if no one heard. My begging, to my seventeen-year-old mind, had made no difference. The only answer was the sound of Mrs. Douglas's sobs on the other side of that thin emergency room curtain." Michelle Obama Cheriss May/NurPhoto via Getty Images As the nation's first black first lady, Michelle Obama grew up encountering racism and bias.In her memoir, "Becoming," she told an emotional story about how a college counselor discouraged her from applying to Princeton, even though she was at the top of her class at her magnet school, in student government, a member of the National Honor Society, and the sister of a current Princeton student.She applied anyway and got in.
