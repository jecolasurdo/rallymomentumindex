(FBI via AP, File) By Sean Philip Cotter | sean.cotter@bostonherald.com | Boston HeraldPUBLISHED: November 27, 2019 at 5:48 p.m. | UPDATED: November 27, 2019 at 5:49 p.m.Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's push to avoid the death penalty will come before the public in two weeks. The oral arguments in Tsarnaev's appeal will take place on Dec. 12 in the John Joseph Moakley Courthouse in South Boston, where U.S. Appeals Court Judge Juan R. Torruella will hear the case. Tsarnaev was sentenced to death in 2015 for carrying out the Boston Marathon Bombing terrorist attack in 2013. The bombing killed 8-year-old Martin Richard, Krystle Campbell, 29, and Lingzi Lu, 23. More than 280 people were injured and MIT Officer Sean Collier, 27, was murdered by Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, at the start of a nearly 24-hour manhunt three days after the bombings that included a region-wide lockdown. Tamerlan Tsarnaev was killed that night. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's attorneys are asking the court to reverse either the death sentence or his convictions and keep him locked up for life instead. In the 207-page briefing, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's lawyers argue that their client could not have received a fair trial anywhere in Eastern Massachusetts because the entire region was rocked by the twin bombings. They also claim 69% of the jury pool believed Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was guilty. Tsarnaev is now on death row in the notorious ADX supermax prison in Colorado, an infamous lockup where he spends his days alongside the likes of Unabomber Ted Kaczynski, "Shoe Bomber” Richard Reid, "Underwear Bomber” Umar Abdulmutallab, Soviet spy Robert Hanssen and the notorious "El Chapo” Mexican gangster Joaquin Guzman, plus a motley collection of murderers, terrorists, cult leaders and mob honchos.
