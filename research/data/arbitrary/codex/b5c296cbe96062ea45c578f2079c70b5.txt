The annual celebration of pop culture, like nearly every other large public event, quickly fell victim to the novel coronavirus pandemic. And while Comic-Con International in May promised it would create an online version open to all, it wasn't until last week that the dates — July 22-26, the same as which Comic-Con had been scheduled for — were revealed. Now, with AMC's announcement, a bit more of the kind of Comic-Con experience planned for 2020 comes into focus. "The Walking Dead” will make its 11th Comic-Con appearance — its first virtual — with a panel focused on the pandemic-delayed finale to its 10th season. "Talking Dead” host Chris Hardwick will moderate as usual. And if you can forget that you're on your couch and not in Hall H of the San Diego Convention Center, you'll get a very similar experience as show creators such as Greg Nicotero and Angela Kang join cast members including Norman Reedus, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Carole McBride from remote locations online. "Fear The Walking Dead” will hold a similar panel focused on its upcoming sixth season, and the third, and newest, piece of the "Walking Dead” franchise — "The Walking Dead: World Beyond” — will introduce its cast and future story to fans for the first time at the Comic-Con. "NOS4A2” will mark its current second season with a panel featuring executive producer Joe Hill and star Zachary Quinto. Comic-Con@Home potentially will reach more — or different — people than the traditional in-person event, which quickly sells out, leaving many fans on the outside looking in. The online version will be free and while Comic-Con@Home will provide with a badge to print at home anyone who wants to check out any of the panels or other offerings can do so. "For the first time in our 50-year history, we are happy to welcome virtually anyone from around the globe,” said SDCC spokesperson David Glanzer in a written statement. "Though stay-at-home conditions make this a very difficult time, we see this as an opportunity to spread some joy and strengthen our sense of community.” The Comic-Con statement said the organization is working to offer as many as possible of the same features of a typical Comic-Con in this new @Home version. They promise that will include everything from panels such as AMC announced Monday to presentations from comic creators, gaming companies and Hollywood studios. "Comic-Con@Home will also have a Masquerade, gaming, and many other activities in which fans can participate from their own homes,” the statement added.

He regularly covers the Oscars and the Emmys, goes to Comic-Con and Coachella, reviews pop music, and conducts interviews with authors and actors, musicians and directors, a little of this and a whole lot of that. He grew up, in order, in California, Arkansas, Kentucky and Oregon. Graduated from Lewis and Clark College in Portland, Ore. with degrees in English and Communications. Earned a master's degree at the Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University. Earned his first newspaper paycheck at the Belleville (Ill.)
