The clinical presentation of psoriatic arthritis is heterogeneous, but often involves the axial joints and distal interphalangeal joints.

Nair, Dafna Gladman, James T. Elder & Proton Rahman Scientific Reports 10, 4925 Reviews | 04 September 2019 Bedside to bench: defining the immunopathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis Data from clinical trials of novel targeted therapies for psoriatic arthritis and other autoimmune diseases, which have produced sometimes surprising results, can inform our understanding of the immunopathogenesis of these diseases and help to identify the most relevant therapeutic targets. Arlene Bravo & Arthur Kavanaugh Nature Reviews Rheumatology 15, 645-656 Reviews | 10 July 2019 Cardiometabolic comorbidities in RA and PsA: lessons learned and future directions The relationship between inflammation, cardiovascular disease and metabolic comorbidities in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis is complex. Understanding these relationships is important for the management of both diseases, as cardiometabolic comorbidities place a considerable burden on these patients. Lyn D.

Jose U. Scher, Alexis Ogdie, Joseph F. Merola & Christopher Ritchlin Nature Reviews Rheumatology 15, 153-166 All Research & Reviews News and Comment News and Views | 05 June 2020 Minimizing efficacy differences between phase II and III RCTs Results from phase II randomized controlled trials (RCTs) determine whether promising therapeutics will progress to phase III. According to detailed analyses in rheumatoid arthritis and psoriatic arthritis, phase II efficacy data systematically overestimate subsequent phase III results, raising the question of how this discrepancy might be addressed in future RCTs.

In 2019, new technologies for examining the molecular characteristics of specific cell subsets have enabled advances in our understanding of the architecture of synovial lymphoid aggregates, macrophage infiltrates and synovial fibroblast subsets.
