On May 25, 2020, George Floyd, an unarmed black man, became the latest victim of police brutality in America. Floyd was heinously killed while in police custody by four members of the Minneapolis police department. Although his death occurred in Minnesota, it mirrored the deaths of so many others at the hands of law enforcement around this country. Many future Marquette Lawyers have taken to social media to educate others on the effects of systemic racism and how they can be of assistance to those in need during this time. Additionally, some of our students have taken to the streets to peacefully protest the unjust killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Sean Reed, George Floyd and to support the Black Lives Matter movement. Promoting equity, academic success, and bringing about change are the very purposes of the Marquette Law Review. After taking into consideration the possible impacts that the latest events have had on the well-being of our students here at Marquette, the Marquette Law Review has decided to amend its original Write-On deadline. After careful consideration, we feel that it would be unduly prejudicial to students, whose goal it is to join the law review, to have them submit a Write-On in the midst of this tragedy. Many students are putting their minds and bodies on the line in order to fight for social justice and change. We believe that no student should be required to decide between their life and an academic competition. As scheduled, the materials for the 2020 Write-On will still be made available for students who wish to access them on June 8, 2020 at 8:00 a.m. However, we will not begin accepting submissions via TWEN until June 15, 2020 at 8:00 a.m.. The final deadline has also been extended by one week, giving students until June 26, 2020 at 5:00 p.m. to submit their Write-On materials. While we do not expect our mere one-week extension to heal the wounds of those impacted, the Marquette Law Review is cognizant that students may need this additional time to gather their thoughts. The Marquette Law Review encourages students to continue to strive for an environment where everyone is uplifted and shown that they matter. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact JC Fuller at j.fuller@marquette.edu or Michaela Hendricks at Michaela.hendricks@marquette.edu. The Marquette Law Review will keep you abreast of any further changes.
