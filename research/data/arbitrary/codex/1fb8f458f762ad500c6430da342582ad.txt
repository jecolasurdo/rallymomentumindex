As a Consultant in Child Psychiarty and Learning Disabilities with a special interest in Autism, I have encountered a number of children and adults with a diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome who in my opinion have an anxiety disorder, like school refusal or social phobia. As Asperger's Syndrome is a life long, basically untreatable condition, it seems extremely important to distinguish it from social anxiety which has an overall much better prognosis. Reasons for the over diagnosis of Asperger's Syndrome may be several, for instance, easier access to educational support with such a diagnosis; relief of guilt feelings for some people to have such a dignosis; the increasing media publicity; the misconception that there is a mild variety to Aspergers' Syndrome (which would be similiar to claims of a mild variety of schizophrenia); but mostly to in my view an unacceptable widening or faulty application of the diagnostic criteria. Autistic Spectrum Disorder as described by Lorna Wing, is clearly described as a contiuum along the intellectual ability scale, but still requires impairments of social and communication skills and a narrowing of interests. The ICD10 criteria are also quite clear, and if applied properly should diagnose the majority of cases. If there is doubt, more prolonged observation and a careful developmental history will confirm the diagnosis. Some patients with chronic social anxiety may appear to have similar impairments, but usually do not have the early history. They are able to communicate quite normally in familiar situations, and have a normal understanding of other people's feelings and social situations although lacking social skills. They are appropriately sensitive peole who should not be placed together with people with Asperger's Syndrome who lack empathy and insight.
