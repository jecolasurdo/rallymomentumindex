Morgan now expects a 25% decline in second-quarter gross domestic product, while Goldman Sachs sees a 34% contraction and Evercore ISI predicts a whopping 50% drop. No matter which way you slice it, the current economic picture is bleak as the coronavirus continues to keep consumers home and businesses closed. But investors should consider that these staggering predictions are stated on an annualized basis—meaning it isn't as bad as it looks. "It's awkward for economists to continue using annualized numbers at this time,” said Diane Lim, an economist at Penn Wharton, "because these conditions won't go on for a full year.” The issue in annualizing more frequent numbers—in this case, quarterly GDP—during the pandemic comes down to pretty basic math. Economists typically translate monthly and quarterly numbers into annualized figures in an effort to come up with percent changes that are easily compared with other annualized data.

PREVIEWSUBSCRIBE Normally, trends last for at least a year, Lim said, and so stretching quarterly figures into annual ones isn't a distortion. "But the current virus is more like a blip than a trend,” she said, adding that the decline in economic activity isn't likely to be quite so severe for more than one quarter. "The literal effect is only about a fourth of what we're seeing,” in terms of the estimates for massive, double-digit declines, she said. To roughly translate the annualized predictions back to quarterly forecasts, Lim said investors can simply divide by four. It isn't a perfect way to back into the truer number, given the impact of compounding growth—or contraction—rates as a year goes on. That is especially the case with shrinking growth, because the base gets smaller as the year goes on. But it's good enough for a rough estimate. Take Goldman's prediction for a 34% contraction in the second quarter, on an annualized basis. That is more like a decline of 9.9% for the current quarter. (If we were looking at translating 30% growth from an annualized rate to a quarterly rate, it would be an increase of 7.6%). Investors can use this calculator to do the math. "Economists are so stuck in their ways,” Lim said, and many aren't accustomed to talking about macroeconomic growth rates in such short-horizon terms. The upshot for investors, she said: "The big numbers should be interpreted as, this is how bad it would get if it repeated itself for a whole year.” And even the most pessimistic forecasters still predict a less severe contraction in the third quarter, followed by modest growth in the fourth quarter.
