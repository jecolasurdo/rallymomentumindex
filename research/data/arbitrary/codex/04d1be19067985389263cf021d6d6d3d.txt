Jesse Sparks graduated with a master's degree from Lesley University after working as a night custodian for four years. Lesley University — -- Jesse Sparks has been a busy man. Not only was he studying to obtain a Master of Arts in Clinical Mental Health Counseling from Lesley University, he also interned as a high school guidance counselor at Cambridge Rindge and Latin School, the same school he graduated from in 2008."It's exciting to be that person that I wish I had." Still, he had to take a job as a night custodian in the school in order to pay for graduate school. "That was kind of the craziness of it all," Sparks, 27, told ABC News. "I'd work from 8 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. as a guidance counselor -- with a full case load. When the bell rang, I'd go to the closet and change into my custodian clothes. It was 16 hours a day in one building."College graduate celebrates when she gets a job offer during graduationSpecial ed teacher surprises her student with graduation cap and gownJesse Sparks graduated with a master's degree from Lesley University after working as a night custodian for four years.

Sparks celebrated the achievement with tweeting two photos of himself -- one in his custodial gear and the other of his diploma. The photos quickly went viral on Twitter, with more than 17,000 retweets and 68,000 likes. The Cambridge, Massachusetts man credits two guidance counselors at his former high school for influencing his career -- Lorraine Suarez-Davis and Dan Wethersby. Now that he's graduated, Sparks plans to work as a school guidance counselor outside of Boston. He can't wait to get started. "Part of the reason why is I think back to when I was in high school, I really wish I could have someone that I could talk to, someone who looked like me," Sparks explained. "It's exciting to be that person that I wish I had," he added.Comments (0)Share to FacebookShare to TwitterEmail this articleTop StoriesMan graduates after working as a night custodian to pay for graduate schoolJun 29, 7:03 PMTrump eschews face covering, ignoring Rubio urging that everyone 'wear a damn mask'Jun 25, 10:30 PMCoronavirus updates: CDC is 'highly concerned' about the fall3 hours agoSpecial prosecutor will investigate 2019 death of Elijah McClainJun 25, 9:03 PM'He's like a child': Biden slams Trump's handling of coronavirus pandemic 2 hours agoABC News Live24/7 coverage of breaking news and live eventsABC News NetworkPrivacy PolicyYour CA Privacy RightsChildren's Online Privacy PolicyInterest-Based AdsAbout Nielsen MeasurementTerms of UseDo Not Sell My InfoContact UsCopyright © 2020 ABC News Internet Ventures.
