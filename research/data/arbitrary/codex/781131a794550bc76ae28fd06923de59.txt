You won't be charged an annual fee, and Citi rounds up your rewards to the nearest 10 points on each purchase (making your $2 coffee worth 10 points). Plus, get a 15,000-point sign-up bonus when you spend $1,000 in three months. What we wish were different: ThankYou Points earned with the Citi Rewards+ Card are considered basic. That means you'll have less flexibility in terms of point redemption or transferring. Bottom line: The no annual fee aspect of this card is where its value lies. To get the most out of the card, you could pair it with the Citi Prestige® Card. Read the full review and apply on Citi's secure website.

The card details have not been reviewed or approved by the card issuer.

Read the full review and apply on Citi's secure website. Learn the basics of the credit card sign-up bonus What are sign-up bonuses on credit cards? A sign-up bonus is a one-time credit card rewards bonus earned from hitting a certain spending threshold within an allotted amount of time. Most sign-up bonuses have spending thresholds that need to be met within 3 months of account opening. Then, the bonus is received 2 to 3 billing cycles after the threshold is met. Here are the three categories that sign-up bonuses typically fall into: Rewards points With a sign-up bonus offering points, you'll usually see a range as low as 10,000 and as high as 100,000 points after meeting the qualifying spend. Travel miles Sign-up bonuses involving miles usually run between 20,000 and 100,000 miles and may require $5,000 or more in purchases within several months of account opening. With most cards, you're able to redeem your miles for cash back, gift cards, merchandise and more, but it is typically more advantageous to use for travel rewards. Cash back Cash back sign-up bonuses tend to vary between $100 and $500, depending on the card, and are great in terms of convenience. In order to receive your cash back bonus, you usually have to spend between $500 and $3,000 within 3 months. How to choose the best sign-up bonus In some ways, judging the best sign-up bonus involves the Goldilocks strategy — finding the one that's just right. To that end, don't impulsively apply for a credit card based solely on an attractive bonus. Make sure it's worth your while before deciding. Here's a list of steps on how to choose the right card with the right bonus for you. 1. Know your financial goals Do you use credit cards to earn cash back, travel miles or another kind of reward? Answer that question and choose a sign-up bonus accordingly. If you don't travel much, it doesn't make sense to get a travel rewards card that offers extra miles as a sign-up bonus. 2. Stay within your spending habits Is your normal spending routine in line with what you would have to spend to earn the bonus? Here's a quick illustration: If you usually spend $500 a month with your card, look for a sign-up bonus with a 3-month spending requirement of $1,500 or less. If you can't realistically meet the spending requirement without overextending your budget, it's best to avoid the temptation. 3. Consider your credit score Credit card applications require a hard credit inquiry, which has a temporary effect on your credit score. If you apply for a card that's out of your credit score range, you could hurt your credit score while being denied. Each credit card available through Bankrate has a recommended credit score. If you don't know the exact state of your credit, you can check your score for free by signing up with Bankrate. 4. Check for pre-qualified offers Make sure to take advantage of any pre-qualification checks a credit card issuer may offer. This preliminary "soft” credit inquiry doesn't guarantee eligibility, but it doesn't have the same effect on your credit score as a hard inquiry. Which credit card has the biggest sign-up bonus? A generous sign-up bonus, sometimes called a welcome offer, is one of the marks of a high-quality rewards credit card. In comparing credit card sign-up bonuses, a lot depends on how you define "biggest” and "best.” A lot of cards offer lucrative bonuses of different kinds, including travel miles, cash back or multi-purpose rewards points. When it comes to credit cards available from our partners, the competition for largest and most valuable sign-up bonus breaks down as follows: Category/card Bonus Spending requirement TRAVEL Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card 60,000 bonus points Spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening Capital One® Venture® Rewards Credit Card (not currently available) 50,000 miles Spend $3,000 on purchases within 3 months of account opening CASH BACK Bank of America® Cash Rewards credit card (not currently available) $200 online cash rewards bonus Make at least $1,000 in purchases in the first 90 days of account opening BUSINESS CASH BACK Capital One® Spark® Cash for Business (not currently available) One-time $500 cash bonus Spend $4,500 in the first 3 months FAQs about credit card sign-up bonuses Here's a list of frequently asked questions, and answers, about sign-up bonuses on new credit cards. Should you get a sign-up bonus credit card? A sign-up bonus or welcome offer can provide an alluring incentive to get a new credit card. How do you know if it's the right decision for you? Consider some of the possible advantages and disadvantages before you apply. Pros: The bonus itself is an obvious financial incentive. Depending on the card and the offer, you could be in line to earn a generous cash back bonus, a bundle of travel miles or whatever specific reward the offer entails. These things have real monetary value. Getting a sign-up bonus credit card can also be an opportunity to upgrade from the card you're currently using. In addition to the bonus, the newer card might offer a better rewards program, more perks and so on. Cons: On the other hand, opening a new credit account is a big commitment. A hard-inquiry credit check that accompanies a card application can temporarily reduce your credit score. If the new card has an annual fee in addition to a bonus, you'll need to factor in that cost as you consider applying for it. The overriding goal of having credit is to use it responsibly. Sign-up bonuses can be lucrative, but always be sure to weigh any short-term gains against your overall credit health. How do you judge the value of a sign-up bonus? Not all bonuses are created equal, and sometimes you need to dig deeper into the numbers to figure out how much they're worth. Follow these tips to get a clearer picture: Calculate the value of points/miles — When the value of a bonus isn't spelled out, resources like The Points Guy's monthly valuations can come in handy. As The Points Guy explains: "These valuations are based on a combination of what I would pay to buy points if given the opportunity and the overall value I could get from redeeming them, factoring in variables like award availability, fees and change/cancellation policies.” Look at the proportions — An overly large spending requirement could reduce the value of a bonus. For example, a $300 bonus after spending $2,000 in 3 months could make more sense economically than a $500 bonus that requires spending twice as much in the same amount of time. Avoid getting overextended — Spending more than you normally would just to meet the bonus requirement could come back to haunt you. If your bonus quest results in carrying a big balance, APR charges could negate the benefits of the welcome offer. How do you know when you've earned the sign-up bonus? Depending on your card issuer, you might receive emails notifying you of your progress. In other cases, the issuer might provide a "tracker” feature with the online customer portal for your account. However, if your issuer doesn't provide email notifications or trackers, you'll have to find out for yourself. Fortunately, the information you need should be available through the customer portal. Your "dashboard” will probably include a running tally of how many rewards points, miles or cash back you've earned, plus the dates when they expire. If all else fails, contact the issuer's customer service department and ask a representative. All in all, expect some amount of lag time between earning the bonus and seeing it show up in (or "post to”) your account. It could be as short as a few business days or a matter of several weeks, depending on the issuer and the specific bonus offer. Look for those details when you read the terms and conditions before applying. Which purchases don't count toward the spending requirement? Most kinds of everyday purchases should bring you closer to meeting the spending requirement for a sign-up bonus. On the other hand, credit card issuers make exceptions for certain transactions that don't qualify. Ineligible purchases and payments typically include: Cash advances Balance transfers Lottery tickets Wire transfers Fees, including annual fees In many cases, these purchases don't earn rewards either. Check the terms and conditions of any credit card you're interested in to get a better understanding of what counts as an eligible purchase in relation to a sign-up bonus, as well as other important information about using the card. Should you keep the card after earning the bonus? Once they've snagged the sign-up bonus, some cardholders might question the value of hanging on to the card. Unfortunately, canceling a card out of hand can be problematic. First, keeping multiple credit accounts open for extended periods of time tends to have a positive effect on your credit score. Canceling a credit card could reduce your credit utilization ratio, the relationship between how much credit you have and how much of it you're using. Credit bureaus take notice of credit utilization and other factors in calculating your score, and your score carries a lot of weight with lenders. A 2019 Bankrate.com survey found several reasons why people cancel credit cards, including lack of use and concern about fees. However, if you cancel a card after earning the bonus just to pursue a bonus with a new card, that strategy might not prove to be profitable. Can you open multiple cards at once to get more sign-up bonuses? The short answer is: You could try, but it's not advisable. In recent years, credit card issuers have taken steps to prevent cardholders from racking up multiple bonuses over a short period of time. Those who try to start a cycle of apply-bonus-cancel could run into stricter eligibility rules — meanwhile, damaging their credit score with each application. Think twice before ditching a credit card just because you've achieved the goal of the sign-up bonus. The potential damage to your credit score might not be worth the fresh start. How we chose our list of top sign-up bonus credit cards Our criteria for including a card on this list include: Bonus value The bonus, whether cash back, travel rewards or multi-purpose points, should be well worth the time and effort of applying for the card. The bonus value should also compare favorably with the card's cost of ownership (annual fees, etc.). Ease of acquiring the bonus The spending requirement to qualify for the bonus should be proportional to its value. Overall quality The card should have a Bankrate Score that puts it in the upper tier of credit cards available from our partners.
