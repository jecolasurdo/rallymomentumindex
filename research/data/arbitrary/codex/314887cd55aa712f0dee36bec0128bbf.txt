And this year, 32 people — including three with New Jersey ties — can consider themselves among the world's top college students.The 2020 Rhodes Scholar recipients were announced over the weekend. There were 963 candidates, but only a few dozen were selected for the honor. The recipients receive scholarships to attend Oxford University in England.The local winners include Prathm Juneja, of Edison. The political science and computer science major is expected to graduate from the University of Notre Dame in December."Notre Dame could not be prouder of Prathm Juneja because he was selected not for his scholarly achievement alone, but — in the words of the Rhodes Trust — 'for their character, commitment to others and to the common good, and for their potential for leadership in whatever domains their careers may lead,'” Notre Dame President Rev. John I. Jenkins said.Juneja plans to earn master's degrees in social data science and public policy at Oxford University next year. He is the 20th Rhodes Scholar from Notre Dame, according to the school's website.Two Princeton University students, Serena Alagappan and Ananya A.
