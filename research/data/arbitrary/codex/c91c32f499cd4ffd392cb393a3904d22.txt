Materials and Methods Compare clinical and pathological staging and lengths using 10,320 2016 National Cancer Institute Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) and 559 2010–2018 non-SEER single-institute surgically-treated cases, and analyze modifiable causes of disagreement. Results The SEER clinical and pathological group-stages agree only 62.3% ± 0.9% over all stage categories. The lymph node N-stage agrees much better at 83.0% ± 1.0%, but the tumor length-location T-stage agrees only 57.7% ± 0.8% with approximately 29% of the cases having a greater pathology than clinical T-stage. Individual T-stage category agreements with respect to the number of pathology cases are Tis, T1a, T1b, T2a, T2b, T3, T4: 89.9% ± 10.0%; 78.7% ± 1.7%; 51.8% ± 1.9%; 46.1% ± 1.3%; 40.5% ± 3.1%; 44.1% ± 2.2%; 56.4% ± 4.7%, respectively. Most of the single-institute results statistically agree with SEER's. Excluding Tis cases, the mean difference in SEER tumor length is ∼1.18 ± 9.26 mm (confidence interval: 0.97–1.39 mm) with pathological lengths being longer than clinical lengths except for small tumors; the two measurements correlate well (Pearson-r >0.87, confidence interval: 0.86–0.87). Reasons for disagreement include the use of family-category descriptors (e.g., T1) instead of their subcategories (e.g., T1a and T1b), which worsens the T-stage agreement by over 15%. Disagreement is also associated with higher tumor grade, larger resected specimens, higher N-stage, patient age, and periodic biases in clinical and pathological tumor size measurements. Conclusions By including preliminary non–small cell lung cancer clinical stage values in their evaluation, diagnostic radiologists can improve the accuracy of staging and standardize tumor-size measurements, which improves patient care.

This study included 135 surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas. An experienced pulmonary pathologist aimed to cut the largest tumor section and measured pathological tumor size (PTS) in fresh specimens. Radiological maximal tumor sizes (RTS) were retrospectively measured on axial (RTSax) and multiplanar reformatted (RTSre) chest CT images. Mean PTS, RTSax, and RTSre were 19.13 mm, 18.63 mm, and 20.80 mm, respectively. RTSre was significantly larger than PTS (mean difference, 1.68 mm; p<0.001). RTSax was also greater than PTS for 6−10-mm and 11−20-mm tumors. PTS and RTS were strongly positively correlated (RTSax, r² = 0.719, p<0.001; RTSre, r² = 0.833, p<0.001). The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.915 between PTS and RTSax and 0.954 between PTS and RTSre. Postoperative down-staging occurred in 11.0% and 27.4% of tumors on performing radiological staging using RTSax and RTSre, respectively. Postoperative up-staging occurred in 12.3% and 1.4% of tumors on performing radiological staging using RTSax and RTSre, respectively. Multiple linear regression revealed that pleural dimpling (p = 0.024) was an independent factor affecting differences between PTS and RTSax. Specimen type (p = 0.012) and tumor location (p = 0.020) were independent factors affecting differences between PTS and RTSre. In conclusion, RTSre was significantly larger than PTS and caused postoperative down-staging in 27.4% of the tumors. Reliability analysis revealed that RTSre was more strongly correlated with PTS than RTSax. Specimen type and anatomical tumor location influenced the measured size differences between PTS and RTSre.ViewShow abstractGross handling of pulmonary resection specimen: Maintaining the 3-dimensional orientationArticleJan 2019 Teodora Radonic Chris Dickhoff Mari Mino-Kenudson Erik ThunnissenThere is limited literature on the gross handling of lung resection specimens. Microscopic examination of the specimen, TNM staging and predictive biomarker testing are fully dependent on an adequate gross handling. In this paper, we present a 3-dimensional (3D) grossing method of oncological lung resection specimens, which ensures proper fixation of the tumor tissue, but also enables accurate correlation with the pre-surgical imaging.ViewShow abstractThe Accuracy of Clinical Staging of Stage I-IIIa Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: An Analysis Based on Individual Participant DataArticleFull-text availableOct 2018CHEST Neal Navani David FisherJayne TierneySarah BurdettBackground: Clinical staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) helps determine the prognosis and treatment of patients; few data exist on the accuracy of clinical staging and the impact on treatment and survival of patients. We assessed whether participant or trial characteristics were associated with clinical staging accuracy as well as impact on survival. Methods: We used individual participant data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs), supplied for a meta-analysis of preoperative chemotherapy (± radiotherapy) vs surgery alone (± radiotherapy) in NSCLC. We assessed agreement between clinical TNM (cTNM) stage at randomization and pathologic TNM (pTNM) stage, for participants in the control group. Results: Results are based on 698 patients who received surgery alone (± radiotherapy) with data for cTNM and pTNM stage. Forty-six percent of cases were cTNM stage I, 23% were cTNM stage II, and 31% were cTNM stage IIIa. cTNM stage disagreed with pTNM stage in 48% of cases, with 34% clinically understaged and 14% clinically overstaged. Agreement was not associated with age (P = .12), sex (P = .62), histology (P = .82), staging method (P = .32), or year of randomization (P = .98). Poorer survival in understaged patients was explained by the underlying pTNM stage. Clinical staging failed to detect T4 disease in 10% of cases and misclassified nodal disease in 38%. Conclusions: This study demonstrates suboptimal agreement between clinical and pathologic staging. Discrepancies between clinical and pathologic T and N staging could have led to different treatment decisions in 10% and 38% of cases, respectively. There is therefore a need for further research into improving staging accuracy for patients with stage I-IIIa NSCLC.ViewShow abstractEffect of Computed Tomography Window Settings and Reconstruction Plane on 8th Edition T-stage Classification in Patients with Lung Adenocarcinoma Manifesting as a Subsolid NoduleArticleNov 2017EUR J RADIOL Hyungwoo AhnKyung Won LeeKyung Hee LeeChoon-Taek LeePurpose: To assess the effect of window settings and reconstruction plane on clinical T-stage determined by solid portion size within subsolid nodules (SSNs), based on 8th-edition TNM standards. Materials and methods: This retrospective study included 247 SSNs from 221 patients who underwent surgery for lung adenocarcinomas between Feb 2012 and Oct 2015. Two radiologists independently measured the diameter of the solid portion on axial, coronal, and sagittal planes using lung- and mediastinal-window. The largest diameter among the measurements on the three planes was referred to as multiplanar measurement. Inter-reader agreement as well as the correlation between the CT and pathologic measurements were calculated using intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs). The proportions of disagreement in clinical T-stage on different measurement methods were measured. The κ values for agreement between clinical- and pathological T-stage were measured. Results: Inter-reader agreement was moderate-to-excellent (ICC confidence interval [CI] range, 0.51-0.92) in lung-window, while it was good-to-excellent (0.77-0.95) in mediastinal-window. The correlation between the CT and pathologic measurements was good-to-excellent (ICC CI range, 0.63-0.82) in lung-window and fair-to-good (0.25-0.78) in mediastinal-window. The proportions of disagreement between clinical T-stages using mediastinal- and lung-window were 32.0%-41.7% and 33.6%-49.0% with axial and multiplanar measurement, respectively. Multiplanar measurement resulted in upstaging in 12.6%-15.8% and 19.0%-24.3% of cases with mediastinal- and lung-window, respectively, when compared with axial measurement alone. The κ values for agreement between clinical T-stage and pathological T-stage ranged from 0.53 to 0.69. Conclusions: Mediastinal-window was a more stable method in the aspect of the inter-reader agreement, but the correlation between the CT and pathologic measurement was better in lung-window. The clinical T-stage varied in up to one-half of the cases according to the window setting, and multiplanar measurement resulted in upstaging in up to one-fourth of the cases.ViewShow abstractMeasurement Bias of Gross Pathologic Compared With Radiologic Tumor Size of Resected Lung Adenocarcinomas: Implications for the T-Stage Revisions in the Eighth Edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer Staging ManualArticleJun 2017AM J CLIN PATHOL Yigu ChenPaul A. VanderLaanKevin R. Anderson Benedikt HeidingerObjectives The eighth edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual now stratifies the T descriptor for lung cancers by each increasing 1.0 cm increment, up to 5.0 cm, with an additional category for tumor greater than 7.0 cm. Bias in pathologic versus radiologic measurements may impact tumor staging. Methods The gross pathologic measurements of 493 resected lung adenocarcinomas were compared with presurgical computed tomography radiologic measurements. Also, pathologic tumor measurement data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program database were examined. Results The distribution of pathologic measurements showed clustering at 0.5-cm increments, with 43.0% of pathologic measurements falling on 0.5-cm increments compared to only 20.3% of radiologic measurements. This pathologic measurement clustering was also observed for both 591,691 resected lung cancers and 3,597,685 tumors of any type from the SEER database. Conclusions Compared to radiologic measurements, gross pathologic measurements cluster around whole- and half-cm values. This measurement bias could lead to incorrect pathologic tumor staging and influence clinical treatment plans.ViewShow abstractMotion Management Strategies and Technical Issues Associated with Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy of Thoracic and Upper Abdominal Tumors: A Review from NRG OncologyArticleFull-text availableMar 2017 Edward Brandner Indrin J Chetty Tawfik Giaddui M. Saiful HuqThe efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has been well demonstrated. However, it presents unique challenges for accurate planning and delivery especially in the lungs and upper abdomen where respiratory motion can be significantly confounding accurate targeting and avoidance of normal tissues. In this paper we review the current literature on SBRT for lung and upper abdominal tumors with particular emphasis on addressing respiratory motion and its affects. We provide recommendations on strategies to manage motion for different, patient specific situations. Some of the recommendations will potentially be adopted to guide clinical trial protocols.

Aim of this study was to evaluate and quantify growth patterns of lung cancers detected in the Dutch-Belgian low-dose computed tomography (CT) lung cancer screening trial (NELSON), in order to elucidate the development and progression of early lung cancer. Materials and methods: Solid lung nodules found at ≥3 CT examinations before lung cancer diagnosis were included. Lung cancer volume (V) growth curves were fitted with a single exponential, expressed as V=V1exp(t/τ), with t time from baseline (days), V1estimated baseline volume (mm3), and τ estimated time constant. The R2coefficient of determination was used to evaluate goodness of fit. Overall volume-doubling time for the individual lung cancer is given by τ*log(2). Results: Forty-seven lung cancers in 46 participants were included. Forty participants were male (87.0%); mean age was 61.7 years (standard deviation, 6.2 years). Median nodule size at baseline was 99.5mm3(IQR: 46.8-261.8mm3). Nodules were followed for a median of 770 days (inter-quartile range: 383-1102 days) before lung cancer diagnosis. One cancer (2.1%) was diagnosed after six CT examinations, six cancers (12.8%) were diagnosed after five CTs, 14 (29.8%) after four CTs, and 26 cancers (55.3%) after three CTs. Lung cancer growth could be described by an exponential function with excellent goodness of fit (R20.98). Median overall volume-doubling time was 348 days (inter-quartile range: 222-492 days). Conclusion: This study based on CT lung cancer screening provides in vivo evidence that growth of cancerous small-to-intermediate sized lung nodules detected at low-dose CT lung cancer screening can be described by an exponential function such as volume-doubling time.ViewShow abstractSize Measurement and T-staging of Lung Adenocarcinomas Manifesting as Solid Nodules ≤30 mm on CTArticleFull-text availableFeb 2017 Benedikt HeidingerKevin R. AndersonEoin M. MoriartyAlexander A. BankierRationale and objectives: This study aimed to compare long-axis diameter to average computed tomography (CT) diameter measurements of lung adenocarcinomas manifesting as solid lung nodules ≤30 mm on CT, as referenced to pathologic measurements, and to determine the impact of the two CT measurement approaches on tumor (T)-staging of nodules. Materials and methods: This institutional review board-approved study included all 274 radiologic solid adenocarcinomas resected at our institution over 10 years. Two observers measured long- and short-axis diameters on pre-resection chest CT in lung and mediastinal windows. T-stages were determined. CT measurements and T-stages were compared to pathology measurements and T-stages using Wilcoxon signed rank test and McNemar test. Inter- and intraobserver variability was determined with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman plots. Results: For lung and mediastinal windows, nodule size was significantly larger using long-axis diameter rather than average diameter (16.93 vs. 14.92 mm, P <.001; and 14.02 vs. 12.17 mm, P <.001, respectively). The correlation of CT with pathologic measurements was stronger with long-axis than with average diameter (ICC 0.808 vs. 0.730; and 0.731 vs. 0.621, respectively). Lung window measurements correlated stronger with pathology than mediastinal window measurements. CT T-stages differed from pathology T-stages in more than 20% of nodules (P <.001). Inter- and intraobserver variability was small with long-axis and average diameter (ICC range 0.96-0.991, and 0.970-0.993, respectively), but long-axis diameter showed wider scatter on Bland-Altman plots. Conclusions: Long-axis CT diameter is preferable for T-staging because it better reflects the pathology T-stage. Average CT diameter might be used for longitudinal nodule follow-up because it shows less measurement variability and is more conservative in size assessment.ViewShow abstractThe Quality of Staging Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Netherlands: Data From the Dutch Lung Surgery AuditArticleNov 2016David J. HeinemanMartijn Geert Ten Berge Johannes M Daniels Hermien WH SchreursBackground: Clinical staging of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) determines the initial treatment offered to a patient. The similarity between clinical and pathologic staging in some studies is as low as 50%, and others publish results as high as 91%. The Dutch Lung Surgery Audit is a clinical database that registers the clinical and pathologic TNM of almost all NSCLC patients who undergo operations in the Netherlands. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of clinical staging of NSCLC. Methods: Prospective data were derived from the Dutch Lung Surgery Audit in 2013 and 2014. Patients were included if they had undergone a surgical resection for stage IA to IIIB NSCLC without neoadjuvant treatment and had a positron emission tomography-computed tomography scan as part of the clinical workup. Clinical (c)TNM and pathologic (p)TNM were compared, and whether discrepancy was based on tumor or nodal staging was determined. Results: From 2,834 patients identified, 2,336 (82.4%) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and had complete data. Of these 2,336, 1,276 (54.6%) were staged accurately, 707 (30.3%) were clinically understaged, and 353 (15.1%) were clinically overstaged. In the understaged group, 346 patients had a higher pN stage (14.8%), of which 148 patients had unforeseen N2 disease (6.3%). In the overstaged group, 133 patients had a cN that was higher than the pN (5.7%). Conclusions: Accuracy of NSCLC staging in the Netherlands is low (54.6%), even in the era of positron emission tomography-computed tomography. Especially accurate nodal staging remains challenging. Future efforts should include the identification of specific pitfalls in NSCLC staging.ViewShow abstractClinical Staging of Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in the Netherlands—Need for Improvement in an Era With Expanding Nonsurgical Treatment Options: Data From the Dutch Lung Surgery AuditArticleNov 2016David J. HeinemanMartijn Geert Ten Berge Johannes M Daniels Hermien WH SchreursBackground: The clinical stage of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) determines the initial treatment, whereas the pathologic stage best determines prognosis and the need for adjuvant treatment. In an era in which stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) has become an alternative modality to surgical intervention, clinical staging is even more important, because pathologic staging is omitted in the case of SABR. The objective of this study was to determine the concordance between clinical and pathologic stage in routine clinical practice for patients with early-stage NSCLC. Methods: Prospective data were derived from the Dutch Lung Surgery Audit (DLSA) in 2013 and 2014. Patients with clinical stage I NSCLC who underwent surgical resection and had a positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) scan in their clinical workup were selected. Clinical and pathologic TNM (cTNM and pTNM) stages were compared. Results: From a total of 1,790 patients with clinical stage I, 1,555 (87%) patients were included in this analysis. Concordance between cTNM and pTNM was 59.9%. Of the patients with clinical stage I, 22.6% were upstaged to pathologic stage II or higher. In total, 14.9% of all patients with clinical stage I had nodal metastases, and 5.5% of all patients had unforeseen N2 disease. In patients with clinical stage T2a tumors, 21.3% had nodal metastases, 14.5% being N1 and 6.7% being N2 disease. Conclusions: Concordance between clinical and pathologic stage is 59.9%. In patients with clinical stage I NSCLC, 22.6% were upstaged to pathologic stage II or higher, which is an indication for adjuvant chemotherapy. Improvement in accuracy of staging is thus needed, particularly for these patients.ViewShow abstractOrganization of the AJCC Cancer Staging ManualChapterJan 2017Mahul B AminStephen B EdgeFrederick L GreeneLaura R. MeyerViewThe IASLC Lung Cancer Staging Project: Proposals for Coding T Categories for Subsolid Nodules and Assessment of Tumor Size in Part-Solid Tumors in the Forthcoming Eighth Edition of the TNM Classification of Lung CancerArticleApr 2016William D TravisHisao AsamuraYasushi YatabeAlexander A. BankierThis article proposes codes for the primary tumor categories of adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA), and a uniform way to measure tumor size in part-solid tumors for the 8(th) edition of the tumor, node and metastasis (TNM) classification of lung cancer. In 2011 new entities of AIS, MIA and lepidic predominant adenocarcinoma (LPA) were defined and were later incorporated in the 2015 World Health Organization classification of lung cancer. To fit these entities into the T component of the staging system the Tis category is proposed for AIS, specifying Tis (AIS) if it is to be distinguished from squamous cell carcinoma in situ to be designated Tis (SCIS). We also propose MIA to be classified as T1mi. Furthermore, the use of the invasive size for T-descriptor size follows a recommendation made in three editions of the UICC TNM Supplement since 2003. For tumor size, the greatest dimension should be reported both clinically and pathologically. In nonmucinous lung adenocarcinomas, the computed tomography (CT) findings of ground glass versus solid opacities tend to correspond respectively to lepidic versus invasive patterns seen pathologically. However, this correlation is not absolute; so when CT features suggest nonmucinous AIS, MIA and LPA, the suspected diagnosis and clinical staging, should be regarded as a preliminary assessment that is subject to revision after pathologic evaluation of resected specimens. The ability to predict invasive versus non-invasive size based on solid versus ground glass components is not applicable to mucinous AIS, MIA or invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas because they generally show solid nodules or consolidation on CT.ViewShow abstractDo Radiologists Have Stage Fright? Tumor Staging and How We Can Add Value to the Care of Patients with CancerArticleFull-text availableJan 2016RADIOLOGYChristine M Glastonbury Priya Bhosale Peter Choyke Daniel C SullivanWith current shifts in our health care system and a growing national discussion around the concept of the value of imaging, it is time for radiologists and nuclear medicine physicians to recognize and accept our role in the multidisciplinary oncology team.ViewShow abstractQuantitative Features of Liver Lesions, Lung Nodules, and Renal Stones at Multi-Detector Row CT Examinations: Dependency on Radiation Dose and Reconstruction AlgorithmArticleDec 2015Radiology Justin Bennion SolomonAchille MiletoRendon C. Nelson Ehsan SameiPurpose: To determine if radiation dose and reconstruction algorithm affect the computer-based extraction and analysis of quantitative imaging features in lung nodules, liver lesions, and renal stones at multi-detector row computed tomography (CT). Materials and methods: Retrospective analysis of data from a prospective, multicenter, HIPAA-compliant, institutional review board-approved clinical trial was performed by extracting 23 quantitative imaging features (size, shape, attenuation, edge sharpness, pixel value distribution, and texture) of lesions on multi-detector row CT images of 20 adult patients (14 men, six women; mean age, 63 years; range, 38-72 years) referred for known or suspected focal liver lesions, lung nodules, or kidney stones. Data were acquired between September 2011 and April 2012. All multi-detector row CT scans were performed at two different radiation dose levels; images were reconstructed with filtered back projection, adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction, and model-based iterative reconstruction (MBIR) algorithms. A linear mixed-effects model was used to assess the effect of radiation dose and reconstruction algorithm on extracted features. Results: Among the 23 imaging features assessed, radiation dose had a significant effect on five, three, and four of the features for liver lesions, lung nodules, and renal stones, respectively (P < .002 for all comparisons). Adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction had a significant effect on three, one, and one of the features for liver lesions, lung nodules, and renal stones, respectively (P < .002 for all comparisons). MBIR reconstruction had a significant effect on nine, 11, and 15 of the features for liver lesions, lung nodules, and renal stones, respectively (P < .002 for all comparisons). Of note, the measured size of lung nodules and renal stones with MBIR was significantly different than those for the other two algorithms (P < .002 for all comparisons). Although lesion texture was significantly affected by the reconstruction algorithm used (average of 3.33 features affected by MBIR throughout lesion types; P < .002, for all comparisons), no significant effect of the radiation dose setting was observed for all but one of the texture features (P = .002-.998). Conclusion: Radiation dose settings and reconstruction algorithms affect the extraction and analysis of quantitative imaging features in lesions at multi-detector row CT.ViewShow abstractDevelopment of new and accurate measurement devices (TruSlice and TruSlice Digital) for use in histological dissection: An attempt to improve specimen dissection precisionArticleOct 2015BRIT J BIOMED SCIG E Orchard Mir Hamza ShamsT NwokieC BrewerHistological dissection of human tissue has relied on conventional procedures, which have largely remained unchanged for decades. Practices to determine measurement parameters employed in these procedures have largely relied on the use of rulers and weighing scales. It is well documented in the scientific literature that both fixation and processing of tissue can significantly affect the viability of the of tissue sections both for tinctorial and immunocytochemical investigations. Both of these factors can be compounded in their negative effects by inappropriate sampling of tissue at histological cut up. There are five key factors to ensure good surgical grossing technique, flat uniformly perpendicular specimen cutting face, appropriate immobilisation of the tissue specimen during grossing, good visualisation of the cutting tissue face, sharp cutting knives and the grossing knife action. Meeting these factors implies the devices are fit for purpose. Here we describe an innovative approach to designing cut up devices to improve accuracy and precision, which take these five key requirements into consideration. The devices showed accuracy and precision, enabling tissue slices to be produced in a uniformly perpendicular fashion to within 2 mm in thickness and to enable consistency and reproducibility of performance across a series of tissue types. The application of a digital rule on one of these devices ensures accuracy and also enables quality control issues to be clearly assessed. As cellular pathology laboratories conform to ever increasing standards of compliance and performance in practice, the advent of assured precision and accuracy at cut up is awaited. Recommendations from accreditation bodies such as the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS) continue to push for improvements in this area of histological investigation. These newly designed devices may give the answers to these requirements and provide the impetus for a new generation of innovative equipment for histological dissection.ViewShow abstractDifferentiating between Subsolid and Solid Pulmonary Nodules at CT: Inter- and Intraobserver Agreement between Experienced Thoracic RadiologistsArticleFull-text availableOct 2015Radiology Afra YildirimPhillip M BoiselleAlexander A. Bankier Carole RidgePurpose: To quantify the reproducibility and accuracy of experienced thoracic radiologists in differentiating between subsolid and solid pulmonary nodules at CT. Materials and methods: The institutional review board of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center approved this multicenter study. Six thoracic radiologists, with a mean of 21 years of experience in thoracic radiology (range, 17-22 years), selected images of 10 solid and 10 subsolid nodules to create a database of 120 nodules; this selection served as the reference standard. Each radiologist then interpreted 120 randomly ordered nodules in two different sessions that were separated by a minimum of 3 weeks. The radiologists classified whether or not each nodule was subsolid. Inter- and intraobserver agreement was assessed with a κ statistic. The number of correct classifications was calculated and correlated with nodule size by using Bland-Altman plots. The relationship between disagreement and nodule morphologic characteristics was analyzed by calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient. Results: Interobserver agreement (κ) was 0.619 (range, 0.469-0.745; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.576, 0.663) and 0.670 (range, 0.440-0.839; 95% CI: 0.608, 0.733) for interpretation sessions 1 and 2, respectively. Intraobserver agreement (κ) was 0.792 (95% CI: 0.750, 0.833). Averaged for interpretation sessions, correct classification was achieved by all radiologists for 58% (70 of 120) of nodules. Radiologists agreed with their initial determination (the reference standard) in 77% of cases (range, 45%-100%). Nodule size weakly correlated with correct classification (long axis: Spearman rank correlation coefficient, rs = 0.161 and P = .049; short axis: rs = 0.128 and P = .163). Conclusion: The reproducibility and accuracy of thoracic radiologists in classifying whether or not a nodule is subsolid varied in the retrospective study. This inconsistency may affect surveillance recommendations and prognostic determinations.ViewShow abstractFeasibility and Accuracy of Extracting Cancer Stage Information From Narrative Electronic Health Record DataArticleAug 2015 Jeremy L Warner Mia A LevyMichael N NeussCancer stage, one of the most important prognostic factors for cancer-specific survival, is often documented in narrative form in electronic health records (EHRs). Such documentation results in tedious and time-consuming abstraction efforts by tumor registrars and other secondary users. This information may be amenable to extraction by automated methods. We developed a natural language processing algorithm to extract stage statements from machine-readable EHR documents, including automated rules to choose the most likely stage when discordance was present in the EHR. These methods were developed in a training set of patients with lung cancer, independently validated in a test set of patients with lung cancer, and compared with the gold standard of Vanderbilt Cancer Registry-determined stage (when available). In the combined data set of 2,323 patients (training set, n = 1,103; validation set, n = 1,220), 751,880 documents were analyzed. A stage statement was extracted from 2,239 (98.6%) patient EHRs (median, 24 documents per patient). Stage discordance was common, affecting 83.6% of these EHRs. Nevertheless, algorithmically derived stage accuracy was high in the validation set (κ = 0.906; 95% CI, 0.873 to 0.939), when including notes generated within 14 weeks from diagnosis. Accurate stage determination can be achieved through automated methods applied to narrative text, despite the frequent presence of discordance in such data. Our results also indicate that stage can be automatically captured in a shorter timeframe than the 6-month window used by cancer registries, as early as 5 weeks from diagnosis. These methods may be generalizable to large narrative cancer data sets.

We aimed to correlate patient and tumour characteristics with VDT and growth rates of primary non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC).Methods Surgically treated NSCLC, which underwent two or more CT scans separated by 25 or more days were studied. Tumour volume was measured using semi-automated volumetric software. VDT and growth rate (1/VDT) were correlated with patient and tumour characteristics.ResultsThirty-six adenocarcinomas (AC), six squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), two large cell and two carcinoids in 46 patients had 109 eligible scans. Median VDT was 191 days (range −9435 to 2256 days); median growth rate was 0.0038 (range −0.0086 to 0.0186). Median growth rate of AC was significantly slower than SCC (0.0034 vs 0.0103, P = 0.037). Nine AC had VDT >400 days, three of which developed distant metastases. Median growth rate of AC was faster in smokers compared with never-smokers (0.0052 vs 0.0014, P = 0.02). Growth rate was not related to symptoms at diagnosis (P = 0.16). Less differentiated tumours tended to grow faster than more differentiated (P = 0.0038). Growth curves of 12 multi-imaged tumours conformed best with the exponential model of growth.ConclusionsNSCLC growth rate appears to be highly variable and related to histological subtype and smoking history, but not the presence of symptoms at diagnosis. Significant growth may be detected in as little as 2 months in NSCLC in smokers. Relatively slow-growing AC can metastasize.ViewShow abstractComparison between CT tumor size and pathological tumor size in frozen section examinations of lung adenocarcinomaArticleJul 2014Tetsuya IsakaTomoyuki Yokose Hiroyuki Ito Munetaka MasudaObjective We examined the appropriate measurement for pathological tumor size by comparing radiological and pathological tumor size of resected lung adenocarcinoma in FSE. Materials and Methods We reviewed records of 59 resected specimens of lung adenocarcinoma for FSE from January to December 2008. Specimens were well-inflated with saline by using an injector before cutting into segments. After selecting the tumor segment of maximal diameter, we compared three ways of measuring pathological tumor size by using paired t-test: (I) macroscopic tumor size (MTS), measured with a metal straight ruler, (II) microscopic frozen section tumor size (FSTS), and (III) microscopic paraffin section tumor size (PSTS). We compared each discrepancy rate (DR) [DR = (CT tumor size – pathological tumor size)/CT tumor size × 100] (%) between tumors that were air-containing type and solid-density type on CT scans, and also compared the tumors with lepidic component rates (LCR) ≧ 50% and LCR < 50%, by using Mann-Whitney U-tests. Results FSE could diagnose malignancy with 100% accuracy. The mean CT tumor size was 18.36 mm, and the mean pathological tumor sizes (MTS, FSTS, and PSTS) were 17.81, 14.29, and 14.23 mm, respectively. FSTS and PSTS were significantly smaller than CT tumor size (p < 0.001). The DR calculated with PSTS was significantly larger in air-containing than in solid-density tumors, and also larger in LCR ≧ 50% than in LCR < 50% tumors. Conclusion FSE with the inflation method diagnosed malignancy with 100% accuracy. The lung specimen must be sufficiently inflated to prevent tissue shrinking, and we propose MTS as the definition for pathological tumor size in FSE. The greater discordance observed between CT tumor size and microscopic tumor size was assumed to be due to shrinkage of the lepidic component in the tumor.ViewShow abstractComparison of Multiplanar Reformatted CT Lung Tumor Measurements to Axial Tumor Measurement Alone: Impact on Maximal Tumor Dimension and T StageArticleFull-text availableNov 2013Am J Roentgenol Carole Ridge James HuangSupriya CardozaMichelle S GinsbergObjective: The purpose of this study was to compare measurements of lung tumor size between axial and multiplanar reformatted CT images, as well as to establish whether the difference between these measurements leads to a change in T stage. Materials and methods: Patients with lung tumors who underwent chest CT up to 31 days before lung resection between December 2010 and March 2012 were included. Axial, sagittal, and coronal CT images were evaluated by two independent readers (1 and 2) who were blinded to clinical data. In 89 patients, lung tumors categorized as T1a (54%), T1b (19%), T2a (24%), or T2b (3%) were analyzed. The longest tumor diameter using multiplanar reformatted CT was compared and correlated with axial CT alone and pathologic T stage. Statistical analysis included a Wilcoxon rank sum test to evaluate differences between measurements, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and kappa statistic to assess agreement. Results: Prediction of T stage using axial CT alone compared with multiplanar reformatted CT agreed in 82% of patients for reader 1 (κ = 0.660 [95% CI, 0.531-0.789]) and 80% of patients for reader 2 (κ = 0.695 [95% CI, 0.572-0.818]). Prediction of T stage using multiplanar reformatted CT resulted in upstaging in 18% and 20% of patients (for readers 1 and 2, respectively). Interobserver agreement (ICC [95% CI]) was 0.900 (0.803-0.954) for axial, 0.874 (0.772-0.946) for sagittal, and 0.754 (0.556-0.921) for coronal planes. Conclusion: Radiologic measurement of lung tumor T stage was higher using multiplanar reformatted CT as compared with axial CT alone. When available, multiplanar reformatted CT should be used to measure tumor dimension and thus assign an accurate lung cancer T stage.ViewShow abstractA comparison of Cohen's Kappa and Gwet's AC1 when calculating inter-rater reliability coefficients: A study conducted with personality disorder samplesArticleFull-text availableApr 2013BMC MED RES METHODOL Nahathai Wongpakaran Tinakon Wongpakaran Danny Wedding Kilem Li GwetBackground Rater agreement is important in clinical research, and Cohen's Kappa is a widely used method for assessing inter-rater reliability; however, there are well documented statistical problems associated with the measure. In order to assess its utility, we evaluated it against Gwet's AC1 and compared the results. Methods This study was carried out across 67 patients (56% males) aged 18 to 67, with a mean SD of 44.13 ± 12.68 years. Nine raters (7 psychiatrists, a psychiatry resident and a social worker) participated as interviewers, either for the first or the second interviews, which were held 4 to 6 weeks apart. The interviews were held in order to establish a personality disorder (PD) diagnosis using DSM-IV criteria. Cohen's Kappa and Gwet's AC1 were used and the level of agreement between raters was assessed in terms of a simple categorical diagnosis (i.e., the presence or absence of a disorder). Data were also compared with a previous analysis in order to evaluate the effects of trait prevalence. Results Gwet's AC1 was shown to have higher inter-rater reliability coefficients for all the PD criteria, ranging from .752 to 1.000, whereas Cohen's Kappa ranged from 0 to 1.00. Cohen's Kappa values were high and close to the percentage of agreement when the prevalence was high, whereas Gwet's AC1 values appeared not to change much with a change in prevalence, but remained close to the percentage of agreement. For example a Schizoid sample revealed a mean Cohen's Kappa of .726 and a Gwet's AC1of .853 , which fell within the different level of agreement according to criteria developed by Landis and Koch, and Altman and Fleiss. Conclusions Based on the different formulae used to calculate the level of chance-corrected agreement, Gwet's AC1 was shown to provide a more stable inter-rater reliability coefficient than Cohen's Kappa. It was also found to be less affected by prevalence and marginal probability than that of Cohen's Kappa, and therefore should be considered for use with inter-rater reliability analysis.ViewShow abstractRealistic simulated lung nodule dataset for testing CAD detection and sizingArticleMar 2010Proceedings of SPIERobert D. Ambrosini Walter O'DellThe development of computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods for the processing of CT lung scans continues to become increasingly popular due to the potential of these algorithms to reduce image reading time, errors caused by user fatigue, and user subjectivity when screening for the presence of malignant lesions. This study seeks to address the critical need for a realistic simulated lung nodule CT image dataset based on real tumor morphologies that can be used for the quantitative evaluation and comparison of these CAD algorithms. The manual contouring of 17 different lung metastases was performed and reconstruction of the full 3-D surface of each tumor was achieved through the utilization of an analytical equation comprised of a spherical harmonics series. 2-D nodule slice representations were then computed based on these analytical equations to produce realistic simulated nodules that can be inserted into CT datasets with well-circumscribed, vascularized, or juxtapleural borders and also be scaled to represent nodule growth. The 3-D shape and intensity profile of each simulated nodule created from the spherical harmonics reconstruction was compared to the real patient CT lung metastasis from which its contour points were derived through the calculation of a 3-D correlation coefficient, producing an average value of 0.8897 (+/-0.0609). This database of realistic simulated nodules can fulfill the need for a reproducible and reliable gold standard for CAD algorithms with regards to nodule detection and sizing, especially given its virtually unlimited capacity for expansion to other nodule shape variants, organ systems, and imaging modalities.ViewShow abstractThe Stage Classification of Lung Cancer Diagnosis and Management of Lung Cancer, 3rd ed: American College of Chest Physicians Evidence-Based Clinical Practice GuidelinesArticleFull-text availableMay 2013Frank C Detterbeck Pieter Edsge PostmusLynn T TanoueThe current Lung Cancer Stage Classification system is the seventh edition, which took effect in January 2010.

Materials and methods: A total of 118 lesions in lung, liver and lymph nodes were selected from 30 patients enrolled in early phase clinical trials. Each CT scan was reconstructed at 5, 2.5 and 1.25 mm slice intervals during the image acquisition. Lesions were semi-automatically segmented on each interval image series and supervised by a radiologist. 1D, 2D and VOL were computed based on the final segmentation results. Average measurement differences across different slice intervals were obtained using linear mixed-effects analysis of variance models. Results: Lesion diameters ranged from 6.1 to 80.1 mm (median 18.4 mm). The largest difference was seen between 1.25 and 5 mm (mean difference of 7.6% for 1D [P < 0.0001], 13.1% for 2D [P < 0.0001], -5.7% for VOL [P = 0.0001]). Mean differences between 1.25 and 2.5 mm were all within ±3.5% (within ±6% confidence interval). For VOL, there was a larger average difference between measurements on different slice intervals for the smaller lesions (<10 mm) compared with the larger lesions. Conclusions: Different slice intervals may give different 1D, 2D and VOL measurements. In clinical practice, it would be prudent to use the same slice interval for consecutive measurements.ViewShow abstractInterrater reliability: The kappa statisticArticleFull-text availableOct 2012BIOCHEM MEDICAMary L McHughThe kappa statistic is frequently used to test interrater reliability. The importance of rater reliability lies in the fact that it represents the extent to which the data collected in the study are correct representations of the variables measured. Measurement of the extent to which data collectors (raters) assign the same score to the same variable is called interrater reliability. While there have been a variety of methods to measure interrater reliability, traditionally it was measured as percent agreement, calculated as the number of agreement scores divided by the total number of scores. In 1960, Jacob Cohen critiqued use of percent agreement due to its inability to account for chance agreement. He introduced the Cohen's kappa, developed to account for the possibility that raters actually guess on at least some variables due to uncertainty. Like most correlation statistics, the kappa can range from -1 to +1. While the kappa is one of the most commonly used statistics to test interrater reliability, it has limitations. Judgments about what level of kappa should be acceptable for health research are questioned. Cohen's suggested interpretation may be too lenient for health related studies because it implies that a score as low as 0.41 might be acceptable. Kappa and percent agreement are compared, and levels for both kappa and percent agreement that should be demanded in healthcare studies are suggested.ViewShow abstractLung cancer staging: Pathology issuesArticleAug 2012SEMIN DIAGN PATHOL Gabriel SicaAnthony A GalThe previous, 6th, American Joint Committee on Cancer and International Union Against Cancer Staging Manual classification of lung cancer was largely unchanged from 5th edition. However, the most recent, 7th, edition has significantly updated the tumor, node, metastasis classification of lung cancer with regards to the inclusion of additional size criteria for T stages and revision of the staging for multiple tumor nodules, and represents the most dramatic change in 30 years. The recommendations for this most recent edition of tumor, node, metastasis classification are derived from a systematic retrospective review of data from a multi-international/institutional database of lung cancers and also incorporate expert opinion, to revise and clarify various staging factors. This review will primarily focus on the pathologically relevant aspects of 7th edition of American Joint Committee on Cancer/International Union Against Cancer classification of lung cancer as well as briefly reviewing the new staging guidelines.ViewShow abstractPathologic staging of tumors: Pitfalls and opportunities for improvementsArticleAug 2012SEMIN DIAGN PATHOLN Volkan Adsay Olca Basturk Burcu SakaStage remains the most important prognosticator of most cancers. In the era of personalized medicine, as the determination of individual characteristics of a given tumor becomes increasingly more important, stage is perhaps one of the best ways to individualize the management of a patient. In the United States, reporting of the American Joint Committee on Cancer/Union for International Cancer Control TNM stage of tumors has all but become a mandate, linked to accreditation of laboratories by College of American Pathologists (CAP), as well as the maintenance of cancer center designations of institutions awarded by the National Cancer Institute and the American College of Surgeons' Commission on Cancer. Providing the stage is now also being considered one of the main "quality indicators" and is linked to reimbursement by insurers. Following suit, many laboratory information system programs have also now integrated CAP synoptic protocols into their software. These regulatory requirements and increasingly widespread usage of staging protocols have also brought to light the imperfections of the current staging protocols. Some are due to the inherent nature of the staging process, which attempts to segregate a continuum (which cancers are) into distinct clusters, which is not always possible. Additionally, although some of the parameters used in staging are evidence-based, many are arbitrary or based on assumptions or logistic progression models. Moreover, some parameters such as the spread of a tumor beyond an organ may seem valid at the theoretic level but are difficult to use in daily practice, for example, for organs without a well-defined capsule. The most problematic issue, however, is the fact that the pathologists are now being asked to incorporate into "pathologic stage" the information that they are not savvy about or cannot verify themselves, such as serum prostate-specific antigen levels or vocal cord paralysis. This current issue of Seminars in Diagnostic Pathology deals with the pitfalls in pathologic staging of common and challenging cancers. In this series of articles written by experts who deal with pathologic staging on daily basis, the authors highlight the problematic aspects of staging in routine practice, discuss the ways these can be dealt with, and also provide a platform for future discussions and improvements in tumor staging.ViewShow abstractVolume doubling time of lung cancers detected in a chest radiograph mass screening program: Comparison with CT screeningArticleSep 2012Oncol LettMaki KanashikiTakuji TomizawaIwao YamaguchiHiroaki SatohThe aim of this study was to evaluate the volume doubling time (VDT) of lung cancer detected in our annual chest radiograph screening program and to compare it with those previously reported for computed tomography (CT) screening. In total, 209 patients who had a measurable tumor shadow and a history of participating in our chest radiograph mass screening program between 2006 and 2009 were included in this study. Indirect roentgenograms for patients with lung cancer were converted into digital images, and the section showing the tumor was enlarged on the monitor to a size of 0.01 mm. The mean VDT for all the patients was 158 days. Only 3.8% of the patients had a VDT of more than 400 days. In 140 patients with adenocarcinoma, the mean VDT was 177 days, and 5.0% of these patients had a VDT of more than 400 days. In the 44 patients with squamous cell carcinoma, the mean VDT was 133 days, and only 2.3% of these patients had a VDT of more than 400 days. These results were different from those previously reported for CT screening. In several reports on CT screening, more than 20% of the lung cancers had VDTs of more than 400 days. Since it is common knowledge that there are 'indolent' lung cancers with a VDT of more than 400 days, screening by annual chest radiography with rare overdiagnosis may need to be reconsidered.ViewShow abstractBeyond Kappa: A Review of Interrater Agreement MeasuresArticleFull-text availableDec 2008 Mousumi Banerjee Michelle Capozzoli Laura Mcsweeney Debajyoti SinhaIn 1960, Cohen introduced the kappa coefficient to measure chance-corrected nominal scale agreement between two raters. Since then, numerous extensions and generalizations of this interrater agreement measure have been proposed in the literature. This paper reviews and critiques various approaches to the study of interrater agreement, for which the relevant data comprise either nominal or ordinal categorical ratings from multiple raters. It presents a comprehensive compilation of the main statistical approaches to this problem, descriptions and characterizations of the underlying models, and discussions of related statistical methodologies for estimation and confidence-interval construction. The emphasis is on various practical scenarios and designs that underlie the development of these measures, and the interrelationships between them.C'est en 1960 que Cohen a proposé l'emploi du coefficient kappa comme outil de mesure de l'accord entre deux eévaluateurs exprimant leur jugement au moyen d'une échelle nominale. De nombreuses généralisations de cette mesure d'accord ont été proposées depuis lors. Les auteurs jettent ici un regard critique sur nombre de ces travaux traitant du cas où l'échelle de réponse est soit nominale, soil ordinale. Les principales approches statistiques sont passées en revue, les modéles sous-jacents sont décrits et caractérisés, et les problémes liés à l'estimation ponctuelle ou par intervalle sont abordés. L'accent est mis sur différents scénarios concrets et sur des schémas expérimentaux qui sous-tendent l'emploi de ces mesures et les relations existant entre elles.ViewShow abstractLung Cancers Diagnosed at Annual CT Screening: Volume Doubling TimesArticleFull-text availableMar 2012RadiologyClaudia I. HenschkeDavid F. Yankelevitz Rowena Yip Olli S MiettinenTo empirically address the distribution of the volume doubling time (VDT) of lung cancers diagnosed in repeat annual rounds of computed tomographic (CT) screening in the International Early Lung Cancer Action Program (I-ELCAP), first and foremost with respect to rates of tumor growth but also in terms of cell types. All CT screenings in I-ELCAP from 1993 to 2009 were performed according to HIPAA-compliant protocols approved by the institutional review boards of the collaborating institutions. All instances of first diagnosis of primary lung cancer after a negative screening result 7-18 months earlier were identified, with symptom-prompted diagnoses included. Lesion diameter was calculated by using the measured length and width of each cancer at the time when the nodule was first identified for further work-up and at the time of the most recent prior screening, 7-18 months earlier. The length and width were measured a second time for each cancer, and the geometric mean of the two calculated diameters was used to calculate the VDT. The χ(2) statistic was used to compare the VDT distributions. The median VDT for 111 cancers was 98 days (interquartile range, 108). For 56 (50%) cancers it was less than 100 days, and for three (3%) cancers it was more than 400 days. Adenocarcinoma was the most frequent cell type (50%), followed by squamous cell carcinoma (19%), small cell carcinoma (19%), and others (12%). Lung cancers manifesting as subsolid nodules had significantly longer VDTs than those manifesting as solid nodules (P < .0001). Lung cancers diagnosed in annual repeat rounds of CT screening, as manifest by the VDT and cell-type distributions, are similar to those diagnosed in the absence of screening.ViewShow abstractCorrelation between tumor measurement on Computed Tomography and resected specimen size in lung adenocarcinomasArticleSep 2011Katharine Lampen-SacharBinsheng Zhao Junting ZhengMichelle S GinsbergTo compare preoperative size of stage I and stage II lung adenocarcinoma as measured by Computed Tomography (CT) and as assessed on gross pathology specimens. 47 patients diagnosed with stage I or II lung adenocarcinoma were evaluated. Institutional Review Board permission was obtained. Tumor contours were delineated using a semi-automated segmentation algorithm and adjusted based on a radiologist's input. Based on the tumor perimeter, maximal in-plane tumor diameter was calculated automatically. The largest single diameter from the pathology gross report was utilized. A paired t-test was used to examine the measurement difference between CT and pathology. The mean largest diameter of the tumors at CT and pathology was 29.53 mm and 24.04 mm, respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between the mean CT measurement and mean pathology measurement of 5.49 mm (standard deviation 9.08 mm, p<0.001). The percent relative difference between the two measurements was 18.3% (standard deviation 28.2%). There is a statistically significant difference between the tumor diameter as measured by CT and on pathology gross specimen. These differences could have implications in the treatment and prognosis of patients with early stage lung adenocarcinoma.ViewShow abstractQuality study of a lung cancer committee: study of agreement between preoperative and pathological stagingArticleSep 2009Ivan Macia J. F. Moya Calquín Ignacio EscobarIgnacio Martinez-BallarinAccurate preoperative staging is essential to provide the best treatment for lung cancer. The objective of the present study was to determine agreement between preoperative and surgical-pathological staging and to analyse the impact of any disparity on treatment. This is a descriptive study of a series of 176 lung cancer cases treated by surgery between 2005 and 2007. Preoperative staging was based on clinical information and computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), PET-CT, bronchoscopy and mediastinoscopy. In all cases, surgical-pathological staging was based on the analysis of surgical samples and the findings during surgery. Both preoperative and pathological stage determination were based on the TNM (tumour, node, metastasis) classification established in 1997. Concordance was measured by calculating agreement rates and the kappa value. Preoperative and surgical-pathological staging agreed in 102 cases, an agreement rate of 58% and kappa value of 0.54 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.44-0.63). The highest kappa value (0.68, 95% CI 0.53-0.82) was obtained in stage IA patients. Patients who underwent PET or PET-CT had a better kappa index (0.56, 95% CI 0.45-0.67, vs 0.39, 95% CI 0.21-0.56). Surgical-pathological staging validated surgery in 145 cases (82%), while 21 (12%) were revised to stage IIIA N2 and 10 (6%) to non-surgical stages. Global agreement between preoperative and surgical-pathological staging was moderate. The best agreement was found in stages IV and IA.ViewShow abstractPOINT: Clinical stage IA non-small cell lung cancer determined by computed tomography and positron emission tomography is frequently not pathologic IA non-small cell lung cancer: The problem of understagingArticleFeb 2009J Thorac Cardiovasc SurgBrendon M. StilesElliot L ServaisPaul C Lee Nasser K AltorkiThere is an increase in interest in limited resection for clinical stage IA non-small cell lung cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of the diagnosis of clinical stage IA non-small cell lung cancer when determined by both computed tomography and positron emission tomography scans and to determine factors associated with understaging. A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database of patients with non-small cell lung cancer was performed. Patients with clinical stage IA cancer determined by preoperative computed tomography and positron emission tomography scan were reviewed. The influence of the following factors was analyzed with regard to accuracy of clinical staging: tumor size, location, histology, and positron emission tomography positivity. Of the 266 patients identified, cancer was correctly staged in 65%. Final pathologic stages also included IB (15%), IIA (2.6%), IIB (4.1%), IIIA (4.9%), IIIB (7.5%), and IV (.08%). Positive lymph nodes were found in 11.7% of patients. Pathologic T classification changed in 28.2% of patients. Cancer in patients with clinical tumor size greater than 2 cm (n = 68) was significantly more likely to be understaged than in patients with tumors 2 cm or less (49% vs 29%, P = .003). Cancer in patients with a positron emission tomography-positive (positron emission tomography +VE) primary evaluation (n = 218) was also more likely to be understaged (39% vs 15%, P = .001). Of patients with positron emission tomography +VE tumors greater than 2 cm, cancer was clinically understaged in 55%, compared with 32% for positron emission tomography +VE tumors 2 cm or less, and only 17% for positron emission tomography negative (-VE) tumors less than 2 cm. Clinical stage IA lung cancer is frequently understaged in patients. Size greater than 2 cm and positron emission tomography positivity are risk factors for understaging. Limited resection should be undertaken with caution in such patients.ViewShow abstractNon-small-cell lung cancer dimensions: CT-pathological correlation and interobserver variationArticleFull-text availableFeb 2009Br J RadiolR E Macpherson Geoff Stuart Higgins John Tallach Murchison Sara ErridgeThe aim of the study was to identify the most accurate CT window level setting for the measurement of non-small-cell lung cancer to optimise CT planning for radiotherapy treatment. 27 patients who underwent resection for non-small-cell lung cancer in a single institution were studied. The maximal superior-inferior, anteroposterior and mediolateral dimensions of the resected tumours were measured by a consultant pathologist. Two radiologists made corresponding measurements using pre-operative CT scans independently of each other and of the pathologist's findings. The measurements were obtained using four different CT window settings. The mean pathological size of the superior-inferior tumours, the anteroposterior tumours and the mediolateral tumours was 32 mm, 28 mm and 25 mm, respectively. A total of 648 CT measurements were taken, of which 321 were within +/-5 mm of the pathological size (49.5%). There was significant interobserver variability between the two radiologists. There was poor correlation between the pathological and radiological measurements of tumour size. Significant interobserver variability was noted between the two radiologists and no window setting could be identified as being superior in accurately assessing the tumour size.ViewShow abstractComparison of imaging TNM [(i)TNM] and pathological TNM [pTNM] in staging of bronchogenic carcinomaArticleSep 1997EUR J CARDIO-THORACA Gdeedo Paul Emile Van Schil Bob CorthoutsE Van MarckPrecise tumor (T) and nodal (N) staging is imperative in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as it determines subsequent treatment, certainly when considering neoadjuvant treatment for stage IIIA or IIIB disease. To determine the accuracy of present-day computed tomographic (CT) scanning a prospective study was performed comparing imaging TNM [(i)TNM] and pathological TNM [pTNM]. In 74 patients with NSCLC without distant metastases (i)TNM was determined on CT findings. The TNM system advocated by the American Joint Committee on Cancer was used. All patients underwent cervical mediastinoscopy. When superior mediastinal nodes were negative this was followed by thoracotomy and pathological examination of the resected specimen and lymph nodes to determine pTNM. The agreement between (i)TNM and pTNM was only 35.1%. The primary tumor (T) was correctly staged in 54.1%, overstaged in 27.0% and understaged in 18.9% of the patients. Invasion of chest wall, pericardium and of major mediastinal structures (T3, T4) was not reliably detected by CT scan. Sensitivity and specificity of CT regarding hilar and mediastinal lymph node staging were 48.3 and 53.3%, positive and negative predictive value 40 and 61.1% and its overall accuracy 51.4%. The nodal (N) factor was correctly determined by CT scan in 35.1%, overstaged in 44.6%, and understaged in 20.3% of the patients. Even with present-day CT scanners (i)TNM provides no accurate staging and routine mediastinoscopy is necessary for precise mediastinal lymph node staging. Likewise, (i)T3 and (i)T4 determinations are unreliable and should not contraindicate thoracotomy.ViewShow abstractComparison of clinical and surgical-pathologic staging of the patients with non-small cell lung carcinomaArticleFull-text availableJan 2003EUR J CARDIO-THORACErdogan Cetinkaya Akif Turna Pinar Yildiz Veysel YilmazClinical staging of non-small cell lung cancer helps to determine the extent of disease and separate patients with potentially resectable disease from those that are unresectable. Since, clinical staging is based on radiologic and bronchoscopic findings, overstaging or understaging may occur comparing to the final surgical-pathologic evaluation. We aimed to analyze preoperative and postoperative stagings in order to evaluate stage migrations and our surgical strategy for marginally resectable patients. We did a retrospective analysis of 180 patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent resectional surgery between 1994 and 2000. In all patients, a thoracic computerized tomography and bronchoscopy were performed to define clinical staging (cTNM). In 86 patients (47.7%) clinical and surgical-pathologic staging concurred. When comparing T subsets alone, correct staging, overstaging and understaging occurred in 133 (73.9%), 28 (15.5%), 47 (26.1%) patients, respectively. Only 13 of 21 patients (61.9%) who were thought to have T4 tumor preoperatively were found to have pT4. Also six patients with cT2 and five patients with cT3 were subsequently found to have T4 disease according to pathology. Clinical staging overestimated the nodal staging in 35 patients (19.4%), while underestimated the lymph node involvement in 45 patients (25%). Construction of cTNM stage remains a crude evaluation, preoperative mediastinoscopy in every patient must be performed. Preoperative limited T4 disease is not to deny surgery to patients since a considerable number of patients with cT4 are to be understaged following surgery.ViewShow abstractComparison Between Clinical and Pathologic Staging in 2,994 Cases of Lung CancerArticleApr 2005 Angel López-EncuentraRicardo García-LujánJuan José Rivas Gonzalo VarelaThe accuracy of clinical staging in lung cancer may be evaluated by comparing it against the gold standard of pathologic staging. The objective of this paper is to compare these two staging methods in a series of 2,994 lung cancer cases operated on consecutively in Spain between 1993 and 1997. The raw frequency of agreement was used to compare clinical against pathologic staging and to assess the agreement. Kappa's index was used to determine the random effect of agreement. Ninety-three percent of the entire population were men, with a mean age of 64 years (median, 66; SD, 9.6). The majority of cases were classified as squamous tumors (1,774; 59%), with complete resection (2,410; 80%), and with lobectomy or bilobectomy (1,490; 55%). The most frequently found pathologic stage was pIB (997; 37%), followed by pIIIA (524; 19%). Considering the 2,377 cases with clinical and pathologic staging data, a classification coincidence was observed in 1,108 cases (47%; Kappa's index 0.248 for stages IA through IIIB). Considering the pathologic staging as the gold standard, the agreement was 75% for stages IA-IB (Kappa's index 0.56). In general, downstaging is more frequent than upstaging. This recent series of lung cancer showed the low diagnostic accuracy of the clinical staging as compared with the pathologic staging. Diagnostic accuracy was found to be much higher in the initial IA-IB stages, as illustrated by Kappa's index.ViewShow abstractPoor correspondence between clinical and pathologic staging in stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer: Results from CALGB 9761, a prospective trialArticleMay 2005LUNG CANCERJonathan D'CunhaJames E HerndonDebra L Herzan Robert KratzkeA major problem with the staging system for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is clinical underestimation of the extent of disease.

Five hundred and two patients with suspected or biopsy-proven NSCLC classified as clinical stage 1 (T1-2, N0) by computed tomography (CT) scan or cervical mediastinoscopy were prospectively enrolled in CALGB 9761. The purpose of CALGB 9761 was to prospectively evaluate molecular markers of micrometastatic disease in stage 1 NSCLC. Enrollment occurred at 11 selected institutions within the CALGB. Patients with clinically suspected resectable early stage lung cancer were eligible for enrollment if they had no evidence of mediastinal or hilar adenopathy on CT scan or if they had CT evidence of potential N2 or N3 disease (lymph node > or =1.0 cm) but with negative mediastinoscopy. No prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy was permitted. Of the 502 patients felt to have clinical stage 1 NSCLC enrolled in CALGB 9761, 489 underwent resection with complete surgical staging and routine histopathologic analysis. From these 489 patients, only 422 (86.3%) turned out to have pathologically documented NSCLC. Of these 422 patients, 302 (71.6%) had pathologic stage 1 disease (173 stage 1A and 129 stage 1B). Despite clinical assessment of stage 1 disease, 59 (14%) patients had pathologic stage 2 disease, 57 (13.5%) had stage 3 disease, and four (0.9%) patients had stage 4 disease. Of the patients undergoing resection for clinical stage 1 NSCLC, 65 patients did not have NSCLC (44 had benign disease and 21 had malignancies other than NSCLC) and two additional patients had dual synchronous primary NSCLC tumors and were not eligible for the study. Overall, only 61.7% (302 of 489) of patients with suspected stage 1 NSCLC disease retained that stage and diagnosis after complete surgical staging, while 38.3% had an inaccurate pre-operative clinical stage or diagnosis. The results from this prospective trial demonstrate the poor predictive value of current clinical staging techniques in early stage NSCLC. These findings will serve as a benchmark for comparison of future clinical imaging modalities and other tests evaluating early stage NSCLC.ViewShow abstractEffect of Formalin Fixation on Tumor Size Determination in Stage I Non-Small Cell Lung CancerArticleDec 2007 Po-Kuei HsuHsu-Chih HuangChih-Cheng HsiehWen-Hu HsuTumor size is an important prognostic factor in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system does not mandate a specific measurement method. Moreover, measuring fresh specimens and formalin-fixed specimens may yield disparate results. Our goal was to evaluate this disparity for stage I NSCLC. We enrolled 401 patients with stage I NSCLC who underwent surgical interventions and follow-up in our hospital between 1993 and 2002. Tumors invading visceral pleura, involving the main bronchus, or associated with atelectasis or obstructive pneumonitis were excluded. Tumor size was measured immediately after resection by surgeons and after formalin fixation by pathologists. Patients were assigned to one of three groups. Group 1 included 201 patients with tumors of 3 cm or less as indicated by both operation notes and pathology reports. Group 2 included 160 patients with tumors larger than 3 cm by both records. Group 3 included 40 patients with tumors larger than 3 cm according to operation notes but 3 cm or less according to pathology reports. Survival rates were compared. Mean follow-up was 58 months. Five-year survival was 70.1% in group 1, 49.1% in group 2, and 51.1% in group 3. As expected, there was a significant survival difference between groups 1 and 2 (p < 0.001); however, there was also a difference between groups 1 and 3 (p = 0.006). Formalin fixation may cause tumor shrinkage and migration from T2 to T1. For accurate tumor staging, size measurements should be performed immediately after resection instead of after formalin fixation. TNM staging should specify how to measure tumor size and the specimen status to be measured.ViewShow abstractRecommended publicationsDiscover moreArticleFull-text availableDiffuse large B‐cell lymphoma presenting with cavitary lung diseaseJuly 2020Yukiko HibinoRyosuke Imai[...]Torahiko JintaDiffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL) with cavitary lung disease is rare and is often difficult to differentiate from primary lung cancer, granulomatous disease, or an infectious disease based on imaging findings alone.

We herein report a case in which a patient with diffuse large B‐cell lymphoma (DLBCL) presented with cavitary lung disease and splenic mass, which was diagnosed by transbronchial biopsy.

Post‐operative pathology showed lung squamous carcinoma in the left lower lobe and mediastinal lymph node metastases, which were confirmed as lung adenocarcinoma. Multiple gene sequencing was performed, and no ... [Show full abstract] relationship was observed between the two primary sites. Chemotherapy consisting of four cycles of gemcitabine plus cisplatin were prescribed for this patient after the operation. After a period of two‐year follow‐up, the lung adenocarcinoma was found to have progressed with new metastases in the right cervical lymph nodes which had the same pathology and gene mutation as the metastatic mediastinal lymph nodes removed two years previously. Meanwhile, a primary lesion was found following PET‐CT scan, and the tuberculosis scar was determined as its point of origin. In conclusion, we have found that a tuberculosis scar is a risk factor of lung cancer, especially adenocarcinoma, and more attention should be paid to close monitoring and follow‐up by clinicians.View full-textArticleFull-text available8th Edition Tumor, Node, and Metastasis T-Stage Prognosis Discrepancies: Solid Component Diameter Pr...June 2020 · Cancers Kazuhito Funai Akikazu KawaseKiyomichi Mizuno[...]Norihiko ShiiyaThe biggest change in the 8th edition of the tumor, lymph node, and metastasis (TNM) classification is the recommendation of the solid component diameter and invasive size for determining the clinical and pathological T-factor, respectively. Here, we validated new proposals for the Lung Cancer TNM classification's revision and compared clinical and pathological T-stages. We retrospectively ... [Show full abstract] analyzed 177 cases of non-small cell lung cancers without lymph node metastasis, and involving complete resection, that occurred in our department between January 2017 and March 2019. We reviewed the overall tumor diameter, solid component diameter, and clinical T-factor on computed tomography (CT), and the pathological tumor diameter, pathological invasion diameter, pathological T-factor, and prognosis. The difference between the pathological invasive size and solid size on CT was within 5 mm in 99 cases (56%). At a two-year recurrence-free survival rate, the clinical T-stage demonstrated a better prognostic outcome than the pathological T-stage. Despite including the benign findings, the solid component diameter was better correlated with prognosis than the invasive size. Therefore, in cases of discrepancies of clinically and pathologically detected tumor size, the solid CT size should also be used for the pathological T classification.View full-textArticleFull-text availableTobacco extracts promote PD‐L1 expression and enhance malignant biological differences via mTOR in g...June 2020 · Thoracic CancerFengqi XiaoYanguo LiuZhihui Zhang[...]Xiuwen WangBackground The aim of this study was to investigate whether tobacco extracts could regulate PD‐L1 expression and enhance malignant biological differences in gefitinib‐resistant cell lines. Methods We constructed gefitinib‐resistant cells and observed the biological differences in gefitinib‐resistant cells. The cells were stimulated with medium containing 5% volume of tobacco extract, and the ... [Show full abstract] change in PD‐L1 expression and the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and p‐mTOR expression in gefitinib‐resistant cells treated with tobacco extracts was observed. We discussed the relationship between PD‐L1 and mTOR. Results Tobacco extracts could promote PD‐L1 expression in the cell line. Western blot analysis showed that mTOR and p‐mTOR were significantly enhanced in gefitinib‐resistant cell lines cultured in the tobacco extracts. The mTOR signaling pathway was involved in PD‐L1 expression and in regulating the expression of cytokines IL‐6 and IL‐23. In addition, the tobacco extracts could promote macrophage migration via mTOR/IL‐6. Conclusions PD‐L1 can transmit inhibitory signals and reduce the proliferation of CD8 + T cells in lymph nodes. Tobacco extracts upregulate PD‐L1 expression via mTOR/IL‐6. These results imply that lung cancer patients should not smoke and stay away from a smoke environment.View full-textPublication AuthorsLoading... orDiscover by subject areaRecruit researchersJoin for freeLoginEmail Tip: Most researchers use their institutional email address as their ResearchGate loginPasswordForgot password?
