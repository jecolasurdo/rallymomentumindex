There's no doubt that television provides gardeners with inspiration, sound advice and good ideas, that's why we're all looking forward to new programmes and the return of old favourites during 2020 but during the current government restrictions don't be surprised to see repeats filling gaps in a depleted schedule and other programmes adopting a different format.. Created by Martyn Loach on Tuesday, 13th of February, 2018. Updated on Wednesday, 24th of June, 2020. As the year progresses, this blog will be regularly updated with dates and times for your TV gardening programmes plus any information we have on features and personalities. Gardeners' World On BBC2 every Friday, with a Sunday morning BBC1 repeat, the 53rd series of Gardeners' Question time alternates between half and full hour programmes. Introduced by Monty Don and his dogs, remotely controlled cameras and archived features are currently being used to bring you the usual mix of practical seasonal advice from well known experts such as Joe Swift and Carol Kelin with the added bonus of amateur footage sent in from viewers. RHS Shows As the BBC has a contract with the RHS until 2021 there should have been extensive coverage of this year's major events. However, The Malvern Spring Festival (7-10 May), Chelsea Flower Show (19-23 May), Hampton Court (6-12 July) and the flower shows at Chatsworth (11-14 June) and Tatton (22-26 July) have all been cancelled. The good news is that Hampton Court has been re-scheduled for 9-15 September and the Malvern Autumn Show is planned for 26-27 September. Gardeners' World Live at the NEC from 18-21 June has also been cancelled and the brand new RHS Garden Bridgewater will now not open until May 2021. Beechgrove Beechgrove has returned and restored to 26 episodes in 2020, packed full of practical hands-on advice covering everyday gardening topics particularly those encountered in Scotland. 'Problem' gardens and the best Scottish gardens and gardeners will again be featured, and we'll also be introduced to novice gardeners and taken on their learning curve. During the current difficult times the individual presenters will be giving weekly updates from their own gardens, these will be broadcast every Thursday evening in Scotland, Sunday mornings on BBC2 in the rest of the country, and for night owls there's a repeat in the early hours of Wednesday on the same channel. Grow Your Own At Home During lockdown Alan Titchmarsh has been busy making this three part series (ITV1 Monday 8.30pm) that proves that 'hands in the soil are good for the soul'. So if you are tired of queuing up outside the supermarket or your town no longer has a grocer, familiar faces from 'Love Your Garden' and amateur gardeners show us how to grow vegetables and herbs whatever the size of your garden. Garden Rescue Working on a restricted budget, gardening's one-time pin-up girl Charlie Dimmock and the gold medal-winning Rich brothers compete for the householder's thumbs-up before going ahead with one of two designs that are presented. A new series is expected in the summer of 2020 and repeats are regularly shown to fill holes in the BBC schedule. If there's nothing on TV.......
