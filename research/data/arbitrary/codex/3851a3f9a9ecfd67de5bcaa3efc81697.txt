2 40.0 The Driver Improvement Points System (DIPS) is a demerit point regime for valid Singapore Driving Licence holders. It is designed to identify and rehabilitate errant drivers through a system of rewards and punishments. Depending on the severity of the traffic offence, the licence holder may accumulate anywhere from 3 to 12 demerit points, and offered a composition fine. If the traffic offence is more severe, the licence holder may accumulate more than 12 demerit points and/or be prosecuted in court and face harsher penalties such as heavier fines, imprisonment and/or disqualification of the driving licence. Suspension of Driving Licence New or Probationary Licence Holders New licence holders will be under a one-year probation from the issued date of their driving licence. During this period, the driving licence will be revoked and invalid if the new licence holder accumulates 13 or more demerit points. Non-Probationary Licence Holders Non-probationary licence holders will become liable for suspension if they accumulate a threshold of demerit points within a certain period. If the suspension is 1 year or more, the driving licence will be revoked and invalid: Number of Suspension Threshold Suspension Duration Suspension Duration after DIPS Retraining Course & Offences are not Accident-Related 1st ≥ 24 demerit points within 24 months 12 weeks May be reduced to 4 weeks 2nd ≥ 12 demerit points within 12 months 24 weeks May be reduced to 12 weeks 3rd 1 year - 4th 2 years - 5th 3 years - To check your driving licence status and demerit points, please visit our E-Services page.

Notice of Demerit Points Accumulated Licence holders will be notified and updated by letter(s) of their demerit points status after they settle every offence where demerit points are awarded. This is to pre-warn the licence holder to improve his/her driving behaviour, and encourage them to remain offence-free for the next 12 months until their demerit points are expunged. Incentives for Good Driving Behaviour Licence holders will have their previous demerit points removed from their record if they do not commit any traffic offences within a 12-month period from the date of their last traffic offence committed.

You must also not have made any claims on your vehicles' insurance for the past 3 years. Under the Driver Improvement Points System, demerit points may be meted out to valid Singapore Driving Licence holders when they commit certain traffic offences. They may also be offered composition fines. Notwithstanding the above, anyone who commits a traffic offence is still liable to face the full punishment(s) that the offence carries.
