NATICK - Spring break was on the horizon, and like millions of students across the land, "My plan was to go home,” said Quinyu Yuki Huang, a sophomore at the Walnut Hill School for The Arts in Natick.She was a world away from home, Guangdong, China."I bought a plane ticket,” said Huang, but she never left the campus. The flight was canceled. Flying to China when the coronavirus was building deadly steam was no longer an option."In China, the pandemic was really bad,” she said. "My family was quarantined. It's a little better now.”Approximately one-third of Walnut Hill's 290-strong student body is Asian. When the pandemic sent plans into a tailspin, "sixty-eight of the Asian students stayed on campus the first month, then 52 went home, now we're down to 16,” said Melissa Cassel, the school's dean of students. "They're living in their original dorm rooms and taking courses online.”Lessons in Character: Profiles of 15 members of the Class of 2020 around MetroWest and MilfordThe dining room has remained open for grab-and-go meals. Maintenance and housekeeping duties have continued. A nurse and counselor are present, and Cassel, who lives on campus year round, checks in daily.Getting flights to China remain a complicated process, and are expensive. Cassel anticipates that students will remain on campus until the end of summer, perhaps longer, depending on the pandemic's influence in the fall.Meanwhile, the 16 remaining students have become a family unto themselves."I'm getting used to it,” said Huang, "but it's hard to be away from my parents. I talk to them every day.”Huang is an only child.Internships get canceled or go virtual because of pandemic"When I got here freshman year, I was pretty shy and afraid. But the teachers and students made me feel welcomed."Right now I've got a pretty nice life here.”Do you want your coronavirus news in one place?

Huang, who hopes to be a classical composer, spent a lot of time playing piano.Zhiyi Rowling Zhu, of Changzhou, China, also stayed on campus."I miss home cooking, and my sister Alice who is 7 ½, and she misses me, but I felt I wanted to stay. I have friends here. My parents felt if I stayed at school it was safer here (than in China).”PHOTOS: Sudbury Community Food Pantry holds a drive at Our Lady of FatimaAnother factor was the toll a flight to China and back would take. "The jet lag is hard,” said Zhu.Zhu attended the MacDuffie School in Springfield last year."I was thinking about my future. I went back to China and started searching for a school. My parents said, 'You decide.' I liked Walnut Hill. The buildings were very modern. Everything was new. The teachers and students were very kind.”Although students can't leave campus, they're making the most of their isolation. Ordering take-out on Fridays is a big deal. Favorite orders? Chinese food and pizza."Sichuan Gourmet in Framingham and Bill's Pizzeria in Natick,” said Zhu.With no students, small college town worries over futureCaution remains a top priority. Whether roaming the small campus or in the classroom and corridors, "we're wearing masks and social distancing,” said Zhu.Separating families, by as many as thousands of miles, has been a major downside to the pandemic. The Walnut Hill students watched their plans to return to China get squashed."It's been hard for the kids to get their heads around this,” said Joe Cabral, who leads the school's vaunted theater program. "But Walnut Hill kept the door open for them.”And the little campus on the hill has become a home away from home.Reach Lenny Megliola at lennymegs41@gmail.com. Follow on Twitter @lennymegs.
