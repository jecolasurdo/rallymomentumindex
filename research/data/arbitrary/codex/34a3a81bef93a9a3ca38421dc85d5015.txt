(Alexei Perelygin/Getty Images/iStockphoto) One of the tallest and most dangerous volcanoes in Russia is spewing a volcanic cloud of ash and steam, sometimes as high as 20,000 feet into the air. The Kmachatka Volcanic Eruption Response Team or KVERT on Monday said a "moderate explosive eruption” of Klyuchevskoy was ongoing, noting that explosion "could occur at any time.” Advertisement The volcano's aviation code, a designation intended to inform pilots on potential dangers, on Tuesday was listed as orange or the second highest warning level. It indicates the "volcano is exhibiting heightened unrest with increased likelihood of eruption” or that "volcanic eruption is underway with no minor ash emission.” Most Read Charlize Theron to 'incredibly overweight' Steven Seagal: You can't fight, 'F--k you!' Connecticut brothers in car chased down black teens on bikes while hurling racial slurs, police say Trump bashes plan for 'Black Lives Matter' mural in front of his Midtown tower At an elevation of 15,580, the Klyuchevskoy is the highest active volcano in Eurasia, Newsweek reported. It was first formed nearly 6,000 years ago and the its first-ever recorded eruption was in 1967. Advertisement Klyuchevskoy is classified as a stratovolcano, which means that its distinct cone shape was formed by multiple layers of lava. It's located near a string of other volcanoes — including the Bezymianny, Karymsky, Kizimen, Shiveluch and Tolbachik — dubbed the Klyuchevksaya group. In total, it consists of 160 volcanoes, 29 of which are still active. Since Klyuchevskoy's recent blast, the nearby Sheveluch, Ebeko and Bezymianny have been labeled as either eruption or restless. Ash fall has not yet been detected in populated areas surrounding the volcano, though officials suspect the towns of Kozyrevks in Kmachatka Krai will likely experience some as it is in the direct path of the volcanic plume.
