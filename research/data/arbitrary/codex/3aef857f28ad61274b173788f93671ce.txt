It is famed for its persistent lava lake which has been active during most of the past decades since it was first discovered in the 1960s. Erta Ale is only 613 m high, but as typical for a shield volcano has a very gentle slopes and a large 40 km diameter base. The summit is truncated by a complex, elongated 1700 x 600 m wide caldera which contains vast lava flows and several larger and smaller pit craters, most notably the active north and south crater, which contains the lava lake at present. Erta Ale is one of the main attractions of the Danakil, and had became a popular tour destination in recent years. Unfortunately, the deadly attack on 4 January 2012 against tourists and scientists camped on the crater rim, in which several were killed, illustrates that the area is politically unstable and can be subject to terrorist attacks. Anyone visiting the volcano should be aware of this.

The lake is contained in the main (southern) pit crater inside the summit caldera of the vast shield volcano, located in one of the most remote places of the Danakil depression in the Afar triangle. Recent satellite imagery shows a significant hot spot from the crater, due to the presence of lava accumulating there as the new lava lake. There are no signs of lava effusing from the fissure vents on the volcano's southern and SE slopes active during 2017-19, which confirms that this lateral eruption has ended for good. This in turn would favor the reformation of the summit lava lake as magma rising inside no longer is being drained on the flank, but uses the central conduit to form a lake in the summit area. Visiting the volcano Hopefully, current travel restrictions still in place will soon be lifted, so it will again be possible to visit the country and bring small groups to the volcano in the frame of our volcano expeditions to Ethiopia. All news about: Erta Ale volcanoInformation about: Erta Ale volcano Previous news Erta Ale volcano (Danakil, Ethiopia) activity update: new surface lava flows 3-4 km SE from summit caldera Monday, Aug 19, 2019 A series of relatively large lava surface flows is visible on recent satellite images, in locations between 3-4 km SE from the summit caldera. ... [more] Erta Ale volcano (Danakil, Ethiopia) activity update: continuing flank eruption Tuesday, Jul 09, 2019 No significant changes have occurred at the volcano during the past weeks. The flank eruption (which had started in early 2017) is still going on, gradually enlarging the vast new lava flow field on the southern and eastern flanks. ... [more] Erta Ale volcano (Danakil, Ethiopia): new fissure eruption on lower ESE flank Thursday, May 30, 2019 A satellite image taken yesterday shows a new hot spot on the SES flank, at about 12 km distance from the summit caldera. Following the report of a possible eruption from the Afdera region, this is likely the area in question and thus becomes a report of Erta Ale volcano instead. ... [more] Erta Ale (Ethiopia): summit lava lake revives as activity at flank eruption site slows down Friday, Oct 12, 2018 Our Ethiopian expedition organiser Enku made a reconnaissance trip to Erta Ale in September and reported the current status of this continuously changing active volcano. It appears that over summer the lava lake in the summit crater slowly rose and remains very active, but that the fissure eruption at the volcano's south flank (which started during the dramatic change of volcanic activity mid January 2017) slowed down. ... [more] Erta Ale (Ethiopia) : activity continues both at the summit and the 2017 flank eruption site Wednesday, Jul 25, 2018 Danakil expedition organiser Enku reports after our recent tour to this Ethiopian shield volcano that activity continues both at Erta Ale's summit caldera and the fissure eruption site on its SE flank with sustained lava lakes. ...
