"That really is the common misconception,” he says of gastroenterology, which he practices at Gastroenterology Health Partners' Louisville location. "We are much more than that.” It wasn't the opportunity to perform endoscopies and colonoscopies, after all, that drew Krease to the medical field in particular. Growing up in the suburbs of Detroit, Michigan, Krease had an early interest in being a veterinarian, but by high school he knew he wanted to be a doctor. He narrowed his field of interest to internal medicine before attending medical school at the West Virginia School of Osteopathic Medicine. He met his wife, Megan, there. She is a pediatrician at All Children Pediatrics in Louisville. They did their residencies together at Oklahoma State University Medical Center. Krease then completed his Fellowship in gastroenterology, hepatology, and nutrition at the University of Louisville School of Medicine.

As much as he enjoyed learning, he also enjoys imparting that knowledge to his patients, enabling them to better understand and manage their own health. But, contrary to what you might think, imparting that knowledge begins not with a lecture, but by listening. "When it comes to talking to patients, I make sure they know I'm listening to them,” McCollough says. "I need to make a personal connection with them that I care about their disease, I care about their complaints. I always ask the question, 'If I could fix one or two things magically today, what would you like me to do? I'm having a one-on-one conversation with you, you can trust me, I'm going to listen to your complaints, and even if I can't fix them, I'll be honest with you about it and try to get you to the right place.' Having a connection and being able to educate them on their disease and also letting them know that I care, because I do.” Those instincts to educate and care for others led to McCollough developing an interest in the medical profession at an early age. He grew up in western Kentucky and attended Georgetown College, in central Kentucky, where he met his wife Robin, who is a physical therapist. He attended the University of Louisville School of Medicine, graduating in 2003. He completed his internal medicine residency there and served as chief medical resident for a year, enjoying the opportunity to teach students. He stayed in Louisville to complete his gastroenterology fellowship in 2010. "I love knowledge and teaching people about things,” McCollough says. "Helping people's quality of life is the main reason I became a doctor. Gastroenterology has allowed me to have a breadth of knowledge that was broad and affords me the ability to continue to learn and help people in a unique way.”Read the full article here: https://www.gastrohealthpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/matthew-mccollough-3.png 284 744 Gastroenterology Health Partners https://www.gastrohealthpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/logo.png Gastroenterology Health Partners2020-04-09 15:14:022020-04-09 15:14:02Dr. Matthew McCollough on Teachable Moments October's MD Update: Dr. Jones Speaks "Going on Offense Against Cancer” October 8, 2019/in Colorectal Cancer, Frontpage Article, News /by Gastroenterology Health PartnersOur very own Dr. Whitney Jones graced the cover of MD-Update's October issue. Read about how he embraces preventative measures to beat colon cancer before it starts in the following article."We spend a lot of money on healthcare and health insurance. The problem is, we're not spending enough on prevention.”— Whitney Jones, MD In the movie "Karate Kid,” there's a scene where Mr. Miyagi asks the title character if he's training to fight. In his light bulb moment, the student responds that he trains, "So I won't have to fight.”Make no mistake, Whitney Jones, MD, knows how to treat cancer. He's trained for it and has years of experience in it. But it's a fight he would prefer doesn't take place."We're going on offense against cancer,” says Jones, a gastroenterologist at Gastroenterology Health Partners (GHP) in Louisville. "We are working on becoming the number one state and the first in the nation to develop programs where we can use genetic testing. We spend a lot of money on healthcare and health insurance. The problem is, we're not spending enough on prevention. The cost of cancer treatments totally overwhelms the cost of prevention.”That has been the central message and purpose of the Kentucky Colon Cancer Prevention Project, which Jones helped found in 2004. The project's work includes education, advocacy, survivor support, and health system change."It put the work of the state in front of the legislature,” Jones says, noting that a diverse group of leaders from across the state formed the project's advisory committee. "It added a mix of healthcare, politics, and business that was catalytic.”The project has received state funding as well as additional funding from the Kentucky Cancer Foundation, which Jones also helped found in 2012. "We have helped pay for a lot of uninsured people to get colorectal cancer screening,” Jones says.The impact of the Colon Cancer Prevention Project is reflected in the state's improvement versus the rest of the country. Jones notes that Kentucky ranked 49th out of 50 in the nation in colon cancer prevention statistics when the project was launched. The state also had the highest rates of incidence and mortality in the nation. Earlier this year, Kentucky ranked 17th best in the nation in the same colon cancer related categories and earned an American Cancer Society Achievement Award for the most improved state in the nation for colorectal screening over the past 15 years."When we started our work at the Colon Cancer Prevention Project, there was a huge gap between what could be done and what we were doing,” Jones says. "It's been a broad coalition, including many of our state leaders and city officials. I think it's proven that Kentucky can address its own problems, we can develop solutions, we can implement them locally, and we can save lives and save money.”Read the full article here: https://www.gastrohealthpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Untitled-design-7.png 176 379 Gastroenterology Health Partners https://www.gastrohealthpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/logo.png Gastroenterology Health Partners2019-10-08 09:30:472019-11-13 15:49:34October's MD Update: Dr. Jones Speaks "Going on Offense Against Cancer" 2019 Kicking Butt 5K Event Saves Lives September 4, 2019/in News /by Gastroenterology Health Partners Thank you to everyone who came out and participated in this year's Kicking Butt 5K!

Since then, colon cancer is down more than 25% in the state of Kentucky. The project works to bring awareness to what is a highly preventable disease as well as offer support to those fighting it.While colon cancer is the 2nd leading cause of all cancer deaths in the United States, when it is detected early, colon cancer is up to 90% curable. According to the Colon Cancer Prevention Project, "It is estimated that 6 out of 10 (60%) deaths from colon cancer could be prevented if everyone were screened at 50.” However, even young people are at risk for developing the disease. 1 in every 10 patients diagnosed are under the age of 50.How to Take ActionPrevent colon cancer by talking to your doctor about the right time to get screened. It is recommended that men and women of average risk should start screenings by age 50. However, those with a family history or symptoms may need to be screened sooner. Don't be afraid to ask your family if they've been screened as doing so could save their life.The Gastroenterology Health Partners proudly sponsors the 2019 Kicking Butt 5k.

"Gastroenterology is fascinating. It affects people on a quality of life level in a way you wouldn't necessarily think of,” says Dr. Sohi. While Dr. Sohi treats patients of all ages (18 years old to 90 plus) she has noticed a bigger percentage of female patients. This is because, while diet and stress commonly affect the gastroinestinal tracts, hormones in the female body can as well. For example, studies show primarily women are affected with IBS and it is normal for a change in the bowel during premenstrual and menstrual periods. "There's also a whole slew of GI issues that can come up during pregnancy.” says Dr. Sohi.Solutions for EveryoneOf all the complaints Dr. Sohi hears, bloating is a reoccurring one. However, according to Dr. Sohi, bloating can be attributed to any number of causes. Often she must explore further to find the root cause and appropriate treatment.Through diagnostic testing and evaluation, Dr. Sunana Sohi works to find a multitude of solutions for a multitude of patients. Whether the solution lies in adjustments to one's diet or lifestyle, a probiotic or laxative, or via yoga and meditation, Sohi is a firm believer that there is a solution for everyone. "I try to work with the individual where they are at and what they want to get themselves feeling better.”If you are experiencing a life impacting GI condition, contact Dr. Sohi or one of the many other Gastroenterology Health Partners today.Read the full article here: https://www.gastrohealthpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Untitled-design.png 176 379 Gastroenterology Health Partners https://www.gastrohealthpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/logo.png Gastroenterology Health Partners2019-07-16 09:30:012019-07-24 19:56:26Dr. Sunana Sohi on Following Her Gut Dr. Emori Carrara On Solving Gastroenterology Enigmas July 9, 2019/in Frontpage Article, News /by Gastroenterology Health PartnersDr. Emori Carrara was recently featured in an MD-Update Magazine article where she is credited with treating her patients with both compassion and insight.Dr. Carrara has been practicing gastroenterology and hepatology at Gastroenterology of Southern Indiana since 2010. As the Kentuckiana area is "one of the nation's hot spots for obesity related epidemics such as colon cancer and non alcoholic liver disease,” Carrara treats a wide variety of patients and offers endoscopic diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.Common patient complaints include:Acid RefluxIrritable Bowel SyndromeConstipation and DiarrheaCeliac DiseaseCrohn's/Ulcerative ColitisHepatitis CAlcoholic Liver DiseaseFatty Liver DiseasePancreatic DiseaseDr. Emori Carrara Specializes in Treating Susceptible Female PatientsAs most women prefer a female doctor when it comes to these rather sensitive topics, Carrara's patient base is mostly female. According to MD-Update, "Functional gastrointestinal diseases or conditions in which doctors can't pinpoint a root cause, even after a thorough evaluation, are more common among women.” For example, a woman's hormone levels have been known to complicate GI symptoms, and can even cause bowel movement issues. Carrara specifically treats the needs of pregnant women and has seen problems like gallstones and liver issues arise during pregnancy.GI & The PsycheWhen it comes to GI disorders, Carrara believes in taking note of one's behavioral patterns and considering lifestyle changes before treatment. "Anxiety can contribute to nearly every gastrointestinal symptom and heighten each one,” says Carrara. IBS for example often stems from anxiety or depression. This is why Carrara recommends "stress reduction through exercise or engaging in hobbies as well as a healthy, balanced diet” in addition to medication.Colon CancerIn addition to participating in clinical trials and supporting the latest in preventive care, Carrara sees preventing colon cancer as one of the most important things she does as a gastroenterologist. "Colon cancer can be prevented with a colonsocopy as we are able to remove polyps before they can develop into colon cancer,” says Carrara.To talk to your doctor about screening, contact us today.Read the full article here: https://www.gastrohealthpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Untitled-design-3.png 176 379 Gastroenterology Health Partners https://www.gastrohealthpartners.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/logo.png Gastroenterology Health Partners2019-07-09 17:09:272019-07-24 19:58:23Dr. Emori Carrara On Solving Gastroenterology Enigmas Dr. John Horlander Explains a Colonoscopy May 6, 2019/in Frontpage Article, News /by Gastroenterology Health PartnersA Gastro Health Partner physician, Dr. John Horlander is Board Certified in Internal Medicine and is a member of the American College of Gastroenterology and the American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy. He has authored various articles relating to gastroenterology and has been involved in research pertaining to the study of gastroenterology.In this episode of WHAS's Great Day Live, Dr. Horlander sits down with Rachel Platt and Terry Meiners to explain the ins and outs of a colonoscopy. Colorectal cancer is the 2nd leading cancer killer both in Kentucky and the United States. A colonoscopy can help screen for both colorectal and colon cancer by detecting and removing polyps. Polyps are abnormal growths within the colon lining. While it can take years for polyps to become cancerous, having them preemptively removed is a good preventative measure.A colonoscopy is an outpatient procedure that requires a cleansing routine the day prior to the procedure. This cleansing routine in the most important part of the procedure. A colonoscopy usually only takes 20 to 30 minutes from start to finish and no discomfort is felt as patients are sedated.

He provides his patients with comprehensive care that has been honed through years of specialized training and experience.On this episode of KET's Kentucky Health, Dr. Evans thoroughly discusses the pancreas as well as pancreatitis.What is the Pancreas?The pancreas is an organ that aids in the digestion of food. Located behind the stomach and deep in the abdomen, inflammation of the pancreas can affect all the important organs that surround it and even cause paralysis of the intestines. The two main functions of the pancreas are to regulate blood sugar and to make a enzyme fluid that helps digest any proteins or fats that are consumed. Pancreatitis is a disease that occurs when the pancreas becomes inflamed.Causes of Pancreatitis Excessive Alcohol AbuseCertain MedicationsHigh Cholesterol Gallstones or Gallbladder Disease (The most common cause.)Virus or Traumatic Injury: (While not very common, viruses or traumatic injuries can result in pediatric cases of pancreatitis.) Distended Belly or Bloating (Present in more significant cases due to inflammation.)Symptoms of Pancreatitis Abdominal Pain (Severe and focused on one's back, especially triggered when eating.)Nausea or VomitingAcute Vs. Chronic Pancreatitis Anyone can have acute pancreatitis. The most common cause of acute pancreatitis is trapped gallstones blocking the flow of pancreatic juice. In acute pancreatitis, inflammation can be so profound that the organ digests itself. Long term complications include a severe episode where one must be admitted to a hospital and kept for a few days, the death of the pancreas itself, a build up fluid that can become infected, as well as an impact on multiple other organs.Chronic pancreatitis is most commonly associated with risk factors such as regular alcohol or tobacco use. Chronic pancreatitis can take months to develop and is often asymptomatic. In chronic pancreatitis cases, scar tissue builds up in the pancreas surrounding the nerves and causing pain. Overtime, one can lose function of the gland as well as the ability to digest food, and are at an increased risk for diabetes as well as pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is the 4th leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States affecting those 45 or older. Signs of pancreatitis cancer include unexplained weight loss, a history of smoking, no obvious cause of pancreatitis, and a family history of the disease. Diagnosing & Treating PancreatitisDiagnosing pancreatitis often involves a basic exam, medical history, lab work and imaging. A CT scan of the abdomen can show if a stone is causing blockage or if a tumor is present. If a gallstone is a factor, an endoscopy may be required. With little if any food intake, pancreatitis usually takes 3-5 days to resolve, and an additional 6 weeks for the pancreas itself to normalize.In order to avoid pancreatitis, abstaining from smoking and drinking is recommended. Educating one's self on gallstones is also a helpful resource in preventative care, as one can have them removed if they become problematic.Watch the full episode of Dr. William Evans on Kentucky Health here: Dr. William Evans earned his Medical degree from St. George's University School of Medicine in Grenada, West Indies.
