After reviewing a full-length score report, students might not be able to accurately diagnose and pinpoint the issue(s) in order to learn from the mistakes. This can inevitably lead to frustration and decreased esteem. Reaching a plateau is not always a bad thing, however. Depending on the score range, this could be a positive sign that you have mastered the content and you are performing consistently. On the other hand, the MCAT can be so daunting that students prefer to start out taking a traditional class or to work one on one with a private MCAT tutor, instead of going at it alone in the beginning. The Tutor the People MCAT tutoring program is a great option because it approaches MCAT prep through personalized learning. This ensures students can build upon their foundation in the sciences to cover new hurdles and learn methods that resonate with them. Working with a tutor who has scored within the 94th percentile or above n the exam, the student can learn new ways to master the content and fearlessly tackle the strategy. Studying for the MCAT and mastering the content is only the first step to MCAT preparation. With any standardized test taking experience, there is an inevitable psychological element of the stressful testing environment that is not as easy to prepare for. Practice is the best way to familiarize yourself with such experiences.
