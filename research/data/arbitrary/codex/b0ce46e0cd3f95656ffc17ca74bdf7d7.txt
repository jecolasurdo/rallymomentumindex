Any time you carry a credit card balance, you automatically sign up to pay interest – expensive interest – on the things you charged. Too much credit card debt can negatively affect your credit score by driving your credit utilization into unfavorable territory. Utilization speaks to the amount of available credit you use at once, and a ratio above 30% is harmful to your score. If you're forced to rely on credit cards to pay your bills and you rack up a high enough balance to exceed that 30% threshold, your credit score is likely to suffer, making it more difficult for you to borrow money the next time you need to.Avoiding credit card debt due to medical costsIf health care expenses drive you to have an unhealthy relationship with your credit cards, your best bet is to rethink your budget and build some emergency savings. That way, you'll have cash reserves to tap when your medical bills come in higher than expected. Ideally, your emergency fund should have enough money in it to cover three to six months of essential bills, but if you can't hit that target, save as much as you can. A good bet is to sock away enough cash to cover your annual deductible, since you'll need to pay it before your insurer picks up the tab for your health care services. Factor health care into your budget in a realistic fashion. Take a look at what your insurance premiums, deductibles and co-pays cost, and figure out how much you should reasonably expect to spend each month. Account for those one-off situations that may pop up on occasion, such as a hospital visit. You don't need to plan on one every month, but it wouldn't hurt to budget for one visit a year. Aflac reported that 37% of families who went to the hospital within the past two years had to pay $500 or more out of pocket. Twenty-three percent spent $1,000 or more, so if your costs are similar, divvy that figure up among 12 months, so you set money aside as you need to. Finally, take advantage of a health savings account, if you're eligible for one. To contribute to one of these accounts, you must be enrolled in a high-deductible health insurance plan, defined as an individual deductible of $1,400 or more, or a family-level deductible of $2,800 or more. The funds you allocate to a health savings account go in tax-free, which means you reap instant savings, lowering your financial burden on a whole and making it easier to keep up with your health care spending. Medical bills are often unavoidable, and they can wreck your finances if you're not careful. If health care expenses drive you to rely on credit cards to an unhealthy degree, it's time to come up with a better plan – before you wind up in a world of debt with no escape in sight.Broken glass, broken dreams Extra $600 in weekly unemployment benefits runs out next month.
