The star hints at the final season of his long-running Fox showBy Jean Bentley Oct 01, 2015 3:30 PMTagsTVBonesEmily DeschanelDavid BoreanazPatrick McElhenney/FOXThere's good news and bad news, Bones fans. Let's go with the good news first: The upcoming 11th season of the Fox show is getting back to the basics. "We'll see more of the banter. We're doing fun shows," star David Boreanaz dished. "We're doing a whole fantasy football episode now; we're doing one with Betty White, who's fantastic. The shows are going to be geared toward what the original pilot was really about."But the bad news: This could be the end. "It's a great way to wrap the whole series up and I'm excited about that," the actor told us on a recent visit to the show's Los Angeles set, while he and costar Emily Deschanel were filming scenes for the upcoming crossover episode with Thursday night time slot mate Sleepy Hollow.That's right—if Boreanaz has his way, the 11th season of Bones will be the last. "For me, personally, I think it's time. I think that 11 seasons is great," he explained. "I mean, one season is great! I don't really count it as seasons but what we've given to the show and what we can do, for me it's great to see the show come to an end and do it the way we want to do it."CLICK: David Boreanaz and Emily Deschanel react to your hiatus tweetsJordin Althaus/FOXThis isn't the first time Boreanaz has hinted at leaving—he memorably tweeted in 2012 after shooting his final scene of the season that it was a "series wrap" for him, and tabloid rumors have persisted over the past few years that he wanted to quit. But this time, it could be legit.When Fox boss Dana Walden spoke of the show returning for an 11th season, she only mentioned it coming back for one more year. "We love the show. It's been so meaningful to the studio and nothing would make us happier than doing another year," she told reporters.It does make sense that the show could be taking a victory lap of sorts. It's been around for more than 10 years, and has performed well in nearly as many time slots. But there's only so long it can go on. So when asked to clarify if yes, this truly is the end of the road for Booth and Brennan, Boreanaz confirmed: "For me it's a yes."Bones airs Thursday nights at 8 p.m. on Fox, followed by all-new episodes of Sleepy Hollow.Should Bones end after 11 seasons?
