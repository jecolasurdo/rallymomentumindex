Dr. Kim Barrett Elected President of the American Physiological Society Kim E. Barrett, PhD, AGAF, is president-elect of the American Physiological Society (APS).The APS is the nation's premier nonprofit organization devoted to fostering education, scientific research, and dissemination of information in the physiological science - the study of how molecules, cells, tissues, and organs function to create health or disease.Dr. Barrett, former Editor-in-Chief of the American Journal of Physiology: Cell Physiology, will assume her new duties at the APS annual meeting being held April 21-25, 2012 in San Diego, CA.Dr. John Chang Receives 2011 NIH Director's New Innovator Award John Chang, MD, has received a 2011 NIH Director's New Innovator Award for his project, "Understanding the Basis for Cellular Diversity During Adaptive Immunity."Dr. Chang's proposal will study fundamental mechanisms by which cell fate is determined during immune responses against microbes. Dr. Chang's research group will receive $2.3 million over the next five years for the study. Dr. Chang was among 49 scientists nationwide to receive the prestigious award this year, which funds research projects "that challenge the status quo with innovative ideas that have the potential to propel fields forward and speed the translation of research into improved health for the American public." The study could have implications for improved vaccine strategies and suggest new treatments for inflammatory bowel disease.The NIH Director's New Innovator Award addresses two important goals: stimulating highly innovative research and supporting promising new investigators. As part of NIH's commitment to increasing opportunities for new scientists, it created the NIH Director's New Innovator Award to support exceptionally creative new investigators who propose highly innovative projects that have the potential for unusually high impact. This award complements ongoing efforts by NIH and its institutes and centers to fund new investigators through R01 grants and other mechanisms.The NIH Director's New Innovator Award program is different from traditional NIH grants in that it is designed specifically to support unusually creative new investigators with highly innovative research ideas at an early stage of an investigator's career when they may lack the preliminary data required for an R01 grant.
