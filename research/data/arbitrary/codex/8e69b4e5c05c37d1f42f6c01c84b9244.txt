Roll call was to name someone you know from a different culture. This led into the lesson "Know Yourself: Understand Others, Improve your Relationships” given by Linda Hess. Avoiding others of different cultures is not practical in education, service, business or community life, so understanding your own traditions is critical in reaching diverse groups. The second lesson given by Linda Hess was "Hope on the Horizon.” This lesson gave helpful hints on recruiting new members to join FCE. New people should feel wanted and they can benefit from being a member. The next FCE meeting will be at the home of Cathy Morgan in Canton on Oct. 10.
