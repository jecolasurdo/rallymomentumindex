By Andy Hoover. Posted 12/14/2012 22:00 Comment on this ShareThis Dizzy appears to be one of those classic franchises to have simply vanished with the passing of time. After a series of successful outings in the late '80s on old PCs, NES, Master System, and Genesis, the egg-based hero got left behind as the gaming world continued on without it. However, a recent iOS revival brought the name back up and the original developers decided to see how much goodwill was left for the forgotten franchise. The creators of the character and franchise, twin brothers Philip and Andrew Oliver, launched a Kickstarter campaign for Dizzy Returns, a game meant to reintroduce the world to one of its forgotten heroes. The twins set out to raise a total of £350,000 ($565,000), but at the time this article was written, it had only reached a little over £25,000 after three weeks of fundraising. Considering the fact that only six days are left, success seems highly unlikely, and the Oliver twins have been surprisingly forthcoming about their realization of this. "We believe that rather than posting updates under the pretense that we might hit our target, it's much better to be honest and upfront with you, our backers,” the Oliver Twins admitted in a recent post. "We may revisit the possibility of another Dizzy game at a later date, but the vision of that game would need to be considerably different.” As highly publicized as Kickstarters numerous successes have been, it can be quite sobering to see that sometimes it isn't the salvation for eager developers.
