Net neutrality is the concept that all data traffic on a network should be treated indiscriminately, where internet service providers (ISPs) would be restricted from blocking, slowing down or speeding up the delivery of online content at their discretion. The current debate surrounding net neutrality is principally about how ISPs should be regulated and what role government should play in overseeing their network management practices. The rule change places primary jurisdiction over internet service providers' network management practices under the Federal Trade Commission and preempts states from enacting similar ISP network restrictions as found in the 2015 Open Internet Order. Attorneys general from 22 states filed a protective petition for review against the FCC in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Five states—California, New Jersey, Oregon, Vermont and Washington—enacted legislation or adopted resolutions in previous legislative sessions. In a deal with the U.S. Department of Justice, California agreed to not enforce its net neutrality law until the lawsuit challenging the Federal Communications Commission's repeal of the federal regulations is resolved. Twenty-nine states and Puerto Rico introduced net neutrality legislation in the 2019 legislative session. California enacted legislation prohibiting mobile internet service providers, upon receiving a request from a first respone agency, from impairing or degrading the lawful internet traffic of the first response agency's account until the earlier of either the time when the account is no longer being used by the agency in response to the emergency or the end of the emergency, subject to reasonable network management. Colorado disqualifies an internet service provider from receiving high cost support mechanism money or other money received to finance broadband deployment if the internet service provider engages in certain practices that interfere with the open internet. Maine enacted prohibitions for a state agency or instrumentality from committing state funds in a manner that the agency or instrumentality knows would result in a direct payment to an internet service provider unless the internet service provider agrees in writing to conform to the requirements of the Federal Communications Commission order, FCC 15-24, adopted on Feb. 26, 2015, known as the Open Internet Order. New Jersey adopted a resolution urging the President and Congress of United States to restore "net neutrality” in federal law. Separately, legislators have introduced measures that would restrict ISPs' use of customer information and adopt privacy protections. For example, two states, Nevada and Minnesota prohibit disclosure of personally identifying information, but Minnesota also requires ISPs to get permission from subscribers before disclosing information about the subscribers' online surfing habits and internet sites visited.
