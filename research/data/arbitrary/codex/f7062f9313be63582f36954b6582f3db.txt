Caffeine Zhorn Software Software Stickies Caffeine Bart ZMeter AHT DripTray Archive Help Knowledgebase Forum Contact Caffeine Versions Download Caffeine Prevent your computer from going to sleep If you have problems with your PC locking or going to sleep, caffeine will keep it awake. It works by simulating a keypress once every 59 seconds, so your machine thinks you're still working at the keyboard, so won't lock the screen or activate the screensaver. The icon is shown above - it's the leftmost one in the task tray, and this is all you see. Double-clicking the icon empties the coffee pot (that's what the icon is) and temporarily disables the program. Double-clicking it again refills the pot, and will keep your machine awake. By default the app starts enabled, and works every 59 seconds. There are some command line switches you can use to alter this behaviour: xx - where xx is a number which sets the number of seconds between simulated keypresses. This must be the first text on the commandline -startoff - application starts disabled. -exitafter:xx - application will terminate after xx minutes -activefor:xx - application will become inactive after xx minutes -inactivefor:xx - application will become active after xx minutes -appexit - terminates current running instance of application -appon - makes the current running instance of the application active -appoff - makes the current running instance of the application inactive -apptoggle - toggles the running state of the current running instance of the application -apptoggleshowdlg - toggles the running state, and shows dialog -replace - closes the current running instance, replacing it -noicon - does not show a task tray icon -useshift - simulate the shift key instead of F15 -showdlg - shows a dialog indicating whether caffeine is active -ontaskbar - show a task bar button (use with -showdlg) -allowss - prevent sleep, but allow the screensaver to start -key:xx - simulate using virtual key code xx Note: the codes on the linked page are in Hex, convert them to decimal for use with this parameter -keypress - simulate a full key press, not just a key up event -oldicons - use more colourful tray icons -darkicons - use icons which work better for dark-on-light colour schemes Compatibility Caffeine works by simulating an F15 key up event every 59 seconds. Of all the key presses available, F15 is probably the least intrusive, and least likely to interfere with your work. However, Caffeine might interfere with some apps: PowerPoint uses the F15 keypress to pause video in a slide Google Docs/Sheets Terminal emulation, e.g. Putty If you think any of these might cause you a problem, set the -useshift command line parameter. Video Caffeine user humancar2n has put together a short YouTube video showing how the app works. Mac version Do you need this functionality on your Mac? Lighthead Software have written a separate app, also named Caffeine, which can help you out.
