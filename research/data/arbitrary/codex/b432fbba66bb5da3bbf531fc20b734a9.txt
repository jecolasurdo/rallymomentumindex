CHRIS MACHIAN/THE WORLD-HERALD Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save THE WORLD-HERALD Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Nebraska universities expect drop in enrollment of international students this fall By Rick Ruggles World-Herald staff writer Rick Ruggles Author twitter Author email May 2, 2020 May 2, 2020 0 Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Try $3 for 13 weeks 1 of 2 Sue Zhang of China majored in civil engineering and math at UNL and plans to get a master's degree in water resource engineering there, as well. CHRIS MACHIAN/THE WORLD-HERALD Sue Zhang, a Chinese student at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, says she expects the coronavirus crisis to cut into UNL's international student enrollment. CHRIS MACHIAN/THE WORLD-HERALD Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save International students bring a wealth of diversity and a healthy chunk of money to many American colleges and universities.But the flow of international students to this country will most likely decrease in the fall. The coronavirus has hit the U.S. hard and may dissuade some international students from coming. Challenges and delays in obtaining visas to America, and in getting flights here, threaten the enrollment of some. Trade conflicts and other tensions between the U.S. and some nations, particularly China, the biggest source of international students, might play into some students' decisions. Further, the number of international students enrolled in American colleges has already dropped over the past couple of years."There are just so many things out of our control,” said Lina Stover, undergraduate admissions director at the University of Nebraska at Omaha.Sue Zhang, a Chinese student who will graduate from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln this month, has decided to go to graduate school at UNL as well. But Zhang, who has majored in civil engineering and math, expects the coronavirus crisis to cut into UNL's international student enrollment.Worry about getting COVID-19 compelled her to stay put at UNL. She had hoped to visit other graduate schools this spring, such as Stanford and the University of California, Davis, but she didn't want to fly while the country was intensely affected by the virus."I think the university is doing everything they can,” said Zhang, who moved with some other international students into UNL's Eastside Suites residence hall when the crisis closed many dorms. Sue Zhang said she expects the coronavirus crisis to cut into UNL's international student enrollment. CHRIS MACHIAN/THE WORLD-HERALD A UNL professor in civil engineering, Dave Admiraal, said Zhang has a passion for learning and the ability to pick up new things quickly. "I have learned so much from them (international students) beyond what I would have learned had I only been exposed to students from the U.S.,” he said in an email.Zhang plans to start working on a master's degree in water resource engineering this summer. As for trade tensions and other conflicts between the U.S. and China, she said they aren't vital to her. "I'm just not that into politics,” she said.Last fall, UNL's international student population fell from 2,807 to 2,560, according to the UNL Factbook, a 9.6% decline. The coronavirus crisis may affect all universities' enrollments in the fall, said Josh Davis, UNL's associate vice chancellor for global affairs. It's too early to say how much, he said."International students really add so much to our campus and our community,” Davis said. They enrich a campus's diversity and have become a key source of revenue to American colleges over the past 10 years. At UNL and Iowa State, they make up close to 10% of the enrollment, and many of them pay full out-of-state tuition.Davis said UNL wants to stay in touch with international students who have stayed on campus or gone home. UNL holds virtual coffee talks, he said, and held a virtual karaoke night this semester. The students "are looking for the signal and message that they're welcome here,” he said.If visa challenges mean that some international students can't get back to Lincoln until the middle of the fall semester, Davis said, UNL will work with them.Nationwide, 623,119 international students enrolled in American colleges in 2009-10, according to a report called Open Doors. By 2016-17, that had shot up 45% to 903,127.Then the number of international students tumbled two straight years to 872,214 in 2018-19, the most recent year for which statistics are available. THE WORLD-HERALD Grant De Roo, a higher education consultant in Iowa City, said "three-plus years of rhetoric that paints other countries as antagonists to the United States” has hurt international enrollment. President Donald Trump's talk about sealing borders, American nationalism and a travel ban for some nations give the U.S. an unfriendly image, he said."I think it's really fundamentally changing the way international students view the United States,” he said.Ryan Hamilton, executive director of the Nebraska Republican Party, said he disagrees. Trump insists that allies fulfill their financial obligations to international organizations like NATO and that Mexico strengthen its border, Hamilton said.If those expectations make the U.S. seem less friendly and unwilling to be taken advantage of, "most Americans are prepared to accept” the consequences, he said.Edna Chun, chief learning officer at the consulting firm HigherEd Talent, said delays in obtaining visas could make it difficult for some international students to come to the U.S. Greater scrutiny of visas is also a concern.Chun cited a Palestinian student from Lebanon who enrolled at Harvard last year. Immigration officials in Boston sent the student back to Lebanon when they found anti-American political messages from his friends on a laptop, according to multiple news accounts. The young man was ultimately allowed in. The coronavirus crisis shows why it's critical to support local journalism The University of Nebraska at Kearney saw a slight decline in international students last year. Tim Burkink, UNK's assistant vice chancellor for international affairs, said he and his staff hope to retain many of their existing international students, about three-fourths of whom remain in Kearney.Visa hangups "would probably be the biggest barrier” to coming to UNK, he said. Staff shortages at U.S. consulates and embassies in other nations (American staffers have been brought back during the pandemic) contribute to visa problems.Burkink nevertheless said he is optimistic that the number of international students at UNK will be flat or only slightly down.De Roo said competition for those students has increased in recent years. English-language nations such as Canada, Great Britain and Australia have upped their higher ed games to provide good degree programs for international students, he said.Not everyone saw a decline last year. Wayne State College said its global enrollment increased last fall to 82 from 38. UNO's rose from 845 to 876.Sue Zhang, who plans to be an engineer, said her parents hope that she will eventually return to China. Their wishes are a major consideration, she said.But she could also imagine getting a job in the U.S. or getting married and staying here. "I was kind of thinking about it,” she said. "Who will know what will happen later?” Close 1 of 67 A pedestrian wears a mask while crossing the Dodge Street bridge on Tuesday, April 28, 2020.
