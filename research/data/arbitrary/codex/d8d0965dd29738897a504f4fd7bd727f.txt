World War 3 News: Nostradamus Predicted Third World War, Alien Attack in 2017? | HNGN - Headlines & Global News Thursday, June 25, 2020 HEADLINES & GLOBAL NEWS HEADLINES TECH SCIENCE/HEALTH ENTERTAINMENT SPORTS CORONAVIRUS DONALD TRUMP World War 3 News: Nostradamus Predicted Third World War, Alien Attack in 2017? By Kanika Gupta Dec 13, 2016 12:25 PM EST According to recent rumors, numerous UFO sightings have been reported from all across the globe, indicating that Nostradamus may have been accurate about his predictions. The self-proclaimed physicist and seer prophesied that an alien invasion in 2017 may change the world as we know it. Nostradamus' didn't stop at that, his predictions also claimed that Russian President Vladimir Putin is the anti-Christ who will bring an end to the world by initiating the Third World War. According to the prophecies, Putin's final battle will be with the Alien army, that he will eventually conquer to take over the world. This drama is slated to unfold between 2017 and 2020, as reported by Movie News Guide. While Alien invasion may seem far-fetched, even though there have been reports of regular sightings, World War 3 seems to be a possibility, given the current situation. An international conflict is brewing that is speculated to trigger the most devastating war this planet has ever seen. Recent reports indicate that everything, between Russian territory and the places where Russian missiles are on-guard, is a battlefield. Experts also claim that should there be a war, it will start in Europe. Based on latest observations, it is anybody's guess that the area that is suspected to go through massive destruction due to war will be one of NATO member states, according to Aussie Network News. With Russia's counter defensive move to deploy military equipment at UK seas, it is a clear indication that the country has Europe in its cross-hairs. With recent events such as rising tension between Russia and NATO states, doubtful statements by USA President-elect to honor the NATO alliance in case an attack on Baltic states, and the influx of Syrian refugees in European continent has impacted not only the security but also the economy of the continent. These reasons and more have led the conspiracy theorists and experts to believe that Nostradamus' predictions about World War 3 may even be true. @ 2018 HNGN, All rights reserved.
