January 2, 2019 What is an APP? Is it imperative that I see a physician for my GI problems or could I see the APP at my doctor's office? An APP is an advanced practice provider (nurse practitioners and physician assistants) and they are becoming commonplace in medical practices and hospitals all over the United States. There are a number of reasons for the "shift” in care including physician shortages as well as the increasing demands of electronic medical records and quality care initiatives which have greatly reduced the amount of clinical time for MDs while increasing a physician's administrative and clerical responsibilities. Gateway Gastroenterology is happy to partner with talented and experienced GI advanced practice providers all of whom have previous experience as nurses in med/surgery, medical ICUs, and even in the GI lab. The advanced practice providers of Gateway Gastroenterology are nurse practitioners who work side by side with the physicians to provide seamless and efficient care to patients with IBS, GERD, liver disease, IBD, etc. While some practices allow APPs to function independently the physicians of Gateway Gastroenterology believe that a collaborative effort simplifies care, increases the opportunity for patient education, and improves the overall GI health of each of our patients. The physicians of Gateway Gastroenterology have a unique skill set and extensive training in endoscopic procedures and practice in a procedure-intensive specialty spending a significant portion of time in the endoscopy unit. At Gateway, the nurse practitioners are integral for the practice to provide timely office follow-up and evaluation. Call the office to visit with one of our highly trained and trusted NPs! March 7, 2017 Diet and lifestyle changes can dramatically improve digestive symptoms... ...and decrease doctor visits! Fast food, chocolate, caffeine, and soda are just a few of the foods that aggravate GI symptoms such as gas, bloating, diarrhea, and heartburn. Dietary changes can decrease symptoms (and GI doctor visits)! Ask us about the low FODMAP diet. Visit with our nurse practitioner to discuss how diet can affect acid reflux and bloating. Consider visiting with a dietician for specific dietary guidance in order to reduce GI symptoms. Visit www.myginutrition.com to learn about fermentable sugars and their affect on the digestive system and then call the office to discuss your symptoms. Colon Cancer Incidence is Rising in Younger Adults Routine screening colonoscopy decreases colon cancer mortality in those over 50 years old, but a new study in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute highlights a disturbing trend...that young patients are being diagnosed with colon cancer at higher rates than they have in the past! And, they are being diagnosed at advanced stages. For example, people born in 1990 have double the risk of colon cancer compared to those born in 1950. Rectal cancer is four times more likely in the younger group. Young patients are being diagnosed at advanced stages because the disease is often not considered in the differential diagnosis when younger patients complain of symptoms, therefore the diagnosis is often delayed. At Gateway, we are aware of this disturbing trend and are happy to arrange appropriate testing so that colon cancer mortality does not increase in our young patients. Bowel Preparation is the Most Important Aspect of Colon Cancer Prevention Colonoscopy is most powerful when the bowel preparation is excellent! Did you know that colonoscopy is less effective (and less protective) when the bowel preparation isn't done correctly? Colonoscopy is MOST EFFECTIVE when small polyps (6mm or less) can be seen clearly and removed. Small, flat polyps are difficult to see especially when there is residual stool in the colon at the time of screening colonoscopy. And, insurance companies may refuse payment for colonoscopy if it has to be repeated for an inadequate bowel preparation. Be sure to follow all of the recommendations for the bowel preparation and call the office with any questions. July 14, 2016 Get social and raise awareness about colorectal cancer March is Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month. While your patients need screening year-round, this month provides a great opportunity to educate your community about colorectal cancer screening and prevention. One of the best ways to engage is online. So AGA created Web and social media tools to help you raise awareness of the need for screening for all individuals age 50 and older. You can find all our tools on our Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month website.
