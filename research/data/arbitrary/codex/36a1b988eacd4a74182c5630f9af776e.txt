View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160125005220/en/ The Discover it Secured Credit Card requires applicants to provide a security deposit, which Discover holds as collateral. After one year as a cardmember, Discover will begin to review Secured Credit Card accounts each month to see if cardmembers can transition to an account that does not require a security deposit. These reviews are based on responsible credit management across all of the consumers' credit cards and loans. "We know how essential it is to establish a healthy credit history when applying for a car or home loan, an apartment lease, and when determining interest rates on loans,” said Ryan Scully, Discover's vice president of marketing. "Discover wants to help consumers build their credit. Our experience shows that 99% of new Discover it Secured cardmembers who didn't previously have a FICO® Credit Score received one on their Discover statements within nine months.” The Discover it Secured Credit Card had previously been available as a counteroffer to select online applicants. However, as of today, all consumers can apply at Discover.com/securedcreditcard. The Discover it® Secured Credit Card features 2% Cashback Bonus at gas stations and restaurants on up to $1,000 in combined purchases each quarter, plus 1% Cashback Bonus on all other purchases. In addition, new cardmembers can double all the cashback they earn at the end of their first year as a cardmember3. "Some secured cards in the marketplace are watered-down versions of other card products that have annual fees and don't offer any rewards,” Scully added. "Discover's Secured Credit Card comes with the same rewards and benefits that every Discover it cardmember enjoys, all with no annual fee.” The Discover it® Secured Credit Card offers: No annual fee, no late fee on first late payment, and no increase to APR for late payment Reporting to all three major credit bureaus FICO® Credit Scores for free on monthly statements and online $0 Fraud Liability Guarantee means cardmembers are never responsible for unauthorized purchases on their Discover card Freeze ItSM – an on/off switch that cardmembers can access on the Discover mobile app or website to prevent new purchases, cash advances and balance transfers if they misplace their card Award-winning 100% U.S.-based customer service available day or night How the Discover it Secured Credit Card Works The Discover it Secured Credit Card requires an application and collateral security deposit to open the account. The credit line is equal to the amount of the security deposit (minimum of $200; maximum of $2,500, based on creditworthiness). For example, a $500 deposit equates to a $500 credit line. Unlike many prepaid or debit cards, the Discover it Secured Credit Card reports to all three major credit bureaus, enabling cardmembers to build their credit with responsible use of the card. Cardmembers who manage their credit responsibly, after a year, may qualify to graduate to an unsecured line of credit, which would allow them to have their security deposit returned while continuing to enjoy all the rewards and benefits of their Discover card.
