Chapman1:30 AM on May 10, 2020 CDTEmail IconCognitive neuroscience has clearly demonstrated that our brains have an amazing lifelong ability to adapt, innovate and overcome. The brain experts at the UT Dallas Center for BrainHealth offer four science-backed tips to boost brain health during this time of stress, uncertainty and isolation.1. Check your stress gauge. When you begin to feel overwhelmed with tension or a sense of rising panic, your brain's natural stress response depletes your moment-to-moment clear thinking. Your reasoning brain goes offline. Learn to identify the physical markers of an emerging stress response: tense muscles, rapid heartbeat, shallow breaths. You can override the stress response and reboot your brain with these brain-healthy actions:Remind yourself this moment or situation will pass.Take five deep, slow, belly breaths and be in the moment. Life is now.Spend a moment observing the beauty of the natural world — sky, moon, colors, sounds, fragrance — to help you see bigger horizons, beyond your immediate circumstances.CommentaryCoronavirus anxiety is placing huge demands on our brainsBy Sandra B. ChapmanOpinion2. Focus and filter. Too much information coming at you in a continual flood — especially when it is negative — paralyzes the brain's goal-oriented networks. Take this two-step approach:Focus in on positive aspects of your life, over which you exert some control. This could be food on the table, meaningful and vibrant relationships, nature to explore, time to read. Write them down if that helps you focus your attention on them.Filter out what is beyond your control. Limit your intake of news to one or two times a day and turn off notifications on your devices; disengage from conversations about how bad things are or all the negative things that could happen; refuse to build a fearful mindset.Public HealthWhat you need to know about coronavirus, plus a map of every case in TexasBy Wire Services and Tom Steele3. Practice intentional innovation. Flexible thinking is like aerobics for the brain and helps you shift your perspective from what is lost to what is still possible. Strengthen your neural efficiency by challenging status quo thinking to discover new approaches and solutions.Use your hidden brain power of possibility thinking. Address a specific problem you are facing by listing at least three choices you can make, however limited or large they may be. New possibilities might reveal themselves to you.Embrace your adaptive brain power. When you feel stalled by the stress of current circumstances, consider that simply making it through each day can become a small victory and an empowering, formative experience. This can help you move forward when circumstances have completely disrupted your routine.When you do not see a clear way through, complete two small steps toward a bigger goal to feel a sense of progress and accomplishment. Your brain's neurochemistry changes in good ways when you do new things.Tell yourself regularly and often: "I can do this. It can happen.” Repeating this mantra can increase your brain's level of dopamine, the powerful neurotransmitter that helps propel you into positive action.4. Make together-time meaningful. Prioritizing connectedness at whatever level is comfortable for you helps build resilience. Here are suggestions for brain-healthy social interactions:Even though you are spending unprecedented amounts of time together with your housemates, checking in has never been more important. Make time periodically to come together and discuss what is working, what isn't, and create solutions together. Consider how you can help each other achieve new goals, things that are simple and doable.Start and end your day with an act of compassion. Begin with those in your immediate surroundings and expand to neighbors, front-line service providers, teachers and co-workers and so forth. Keep a log of acts of compassion that you perform, as well as where you are the recipient. At the end of each week, review the log and take stock about any improvements in your general levels of stress and happiness.Find the humor. Shared laughter strengthens social bonds and rewards your brain with dopamine, the feel-good hormone. Be intentional about finding at least one opportunity a day to share a laugh with someone else, even if it is on you.Sandra B.
