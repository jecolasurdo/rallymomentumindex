(Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Although the debate over the gentrification of New York City neighborhoods has drawn the media spotlight in recent months, it is distracting us from a much larger challenge facing American cities: the persistence and growth of concentrated poverty. An analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data from 1970 to 2010 shows that gentrification of high-poverty neighborhoods, although disruptive, is rare. While new apartment buildings and high-end restaurants popping up in Chelsea and Williamsburg capture our attention, we often overlook two more potent storylines.

The second is the spread of concentrated poverty: Today there are three times as many urban neighborhoods with poverty rates exceeding 30% as there were in 1970, and the number of poor people living in these neighborhoods has doubled. In reality, it is rare for an urban, high-poverty neighborhood to experience a major decline in poverty. If we use a decrease in poverty rates as an indicator of gentrification, the data suggest that dramatic change is not widespread. Advertisement The sheer scale of the spread of concentrated poverty emphasizes how modest the effect of gentrification has been on the location of the poor. Only about 100 census tracts in major American cities that experienced high poverty in 1970 have since gentrified and had poverty rates decline to below the national average. These census tracts contain only 5% of the population that is living in concentrated poverty. Over the same period, the number of poor people living in "fallen star" neighborhoods — places that in 1970 had below-average poverty rates, but which today have poverty rates of 30% or higher — has increased by a staggering 1.2 million. This trend suggests that, at most, the relocation of the poor attributable to gentrification accounts for about 5% of the increase of population living in concentrated poverty. Gentrification may make the contrast between wealth and poverty more evident where it occurs, but is not a major contributor to worsening the plight of the urban poor. In New York, just 15 of the nearly 200 high-poverty neighborhoods from 1970 saw their poverty rate decline to below the national average of 15% by 2010. At the same time, the number of high poverty tracts in the metro area nearly doubled the number of persons living in poverty in these neighborhoods increased more than 50%. More than 100 formerly low poverty neighborhoods in the metro area now have poverty rates of over 30%. All of this is to say: If we are concerned about the plight of the poor in the nation's urban areas, we should be far more troubled by the continued persistence of concentrated poverty than about genrification. To be poor anywhere is difficult enough, but a growing body of evidence shows the negative effects of poverty are amplified for those who live in high-poverty neighborhoods-places where 30% or more of the population live below the poverty line.

Quality of life is worse, crime is higher, public services are weaker and economic opportunity more distant in concentrated poverty neighborhoods. Concentrated poverty figures prominently in the inter-generational transmission of inequality: Children growing up in neighborhoods of concentrated poverty have permanently impaired economic prospects.

Connecticut brothers in car chased down black teens on bikes while hurling racial slurs, police say Steve Bing, Elizabeth Hurley's ex-boyfriend, died from multiple blunt trauma: coroner A variety of factors — some global and others local — appear to be driving the growth in concentrated poverty. Growing income inequality in the United States is thinning the number of families in the middle class and increasing the numbers of high-income and low-income households. Real wages have declined for moderately skilled workers. And local land use restrictions in many metro areas segregate rich and poor and make it difficult to increase density in areas where there is demand for additional housing. These potent, slow-acting forces are creating new high-poverty neighborhoods far faster than boutique shops, fusion restaurants and new apartments are edging out old ones. When it comes to America's urban neighborhoods, the old maxim seems to hold true: Change is the only constant. High-poverty neighborhoods tend to follow one of two paths. Most continue to be places of chronic poverty, but experience a steady decline in population. A handful do gentrify, attracting new investment, reducing poverty and increasing population. While the visible transformation of a few formerly high poverty neighborhoods captures our attention, it masks a larger and more troubling trend-the steady expansion of new high poverty neighborhoods. If we're to tackle the challenges of concentrated poverty, we'll have to come to better understand these dynamics of change.
