Learn the Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment Triangle Region / 27 Mar 2020 by EmergeOrtho Have you experienced a sudden, intense pain in your big toe or one of your joints? You may think it is just a spasm, but it could be something a bit more serious. These symptoms could be an indication of gout. You may be wondering, what causes gout?

Seek Out Gout Treatment from the Region's Rheumatology Experts As important as it is to seek care, it is just as important to seek education. Below, we delve deeper into what gout is, its causes, symptoms, and treatment options. What Is Gout? Gout is a type of inflammatory arthritis that develops when there is an accumulation of too much uric acid in the bloodstream. It does worsen overtime and can become chronic. You can, however, successfully control the disease and protect your joints with treatment. Uric acid is a chemical produced when the body breaks down substances called purines. Purines naturally occur in the body, but can also be found in a lot of the foods we eat, such as shellfish, dried beans, peas, and beer. Uric acid is normally cleaned out of the blood by the kidneys, and then passes through the body in urine. When the body produces too much uric acid or the kidneys dispose too little of it, it builds up in the bloodstream. This causes the body to convert the acid into microscopic, spiked crystals. This is a condition called hyperuricemia. These crystals can then become trapped in the joints and soft tissue. Why does it most often occur in the big toe? Because uric acid is sensitive to temperature. The uric acid crystalizes at cooler temperatures, and since the big toe is furthest from naturally-occurring body heat, it is often the site of gout (although, gout can occur in any joint). When the crystals are detected in the joints, the body sees them as foreign entities or bacteria. The body sends white blood cells and other infection-fighting cells to the area to combat the crystals, which results in inflammation, redness, and pain. What Causes Gout? Gout affects approximately 2 out of 100 people in the United States. The condition is caused by the buildup of uric acid (as explained above), but there are certain factors that put people at a greater risk for developing gout: Genetics Obesity Excessive alcohol consumption Certain medications, such as diuretics, aspirin, and cyclosporine Younger men (ages 30-45) Older women post-menopause (ages 55-70) Existing health conditions, such as high blood pressure, kidney disease, diabetes, and certain types of anemias What Are the Symptoms of Gout? Gout attacks are usually sudden, severe, and extremely painful. The affected area will typically be red, swollen, tender, and even feel hot. Certain cases of gout are subject to infection, which will cause a fever. After the first gout attack, the next one may not occur for months or even years. As time goes on, and if no preventative measures are taken, the attacks can become much more severe and frequent. Another negative side effect of leaving gout untreated is the possible formation of tophi, which are white, chalky deposits that develop around the affected joints and tendons. Tophi create visible lumps under the skin. If the gout progresses to the chronic stage, joints may sustain permanent damage and deformity. When gout is treated, it rarely progresses into this disabling stage. What Are Gout Treatment Options? Most cases of gout (that are not in the chronic stage), can be successfully treated with a combination of non-surgical methods. Your doctor will put together a customized treatment plan for you after your examination that may include: Rest Ice Elevation Non-steroidal, anti-inflammatory medications Prescription medications Corticosteroids Lifestyle changes For those who experience frequent gout attacks or develop chronic gouty arthritis, your Rheumatologist will recommend medication to permanently lower the blood level of uric acid. The goal of uric acid lowering therapy is to prevent future acute attacks of gout, and to gradually dissolve the uric acid containing tophi.
