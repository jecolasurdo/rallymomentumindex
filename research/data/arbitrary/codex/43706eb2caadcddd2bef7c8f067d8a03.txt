The cell with different spreading state had significantly different responses to mechanical (i.e., matrix stiffness) and biochemical (i.e., transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1)) cues.

Voss, Brian I. Rini, Thomas Powles, Laurence Albiges, Rachel H. Giles & Eric Jonasch British Journal of Cancer, 1-7 Research 26 June 2020 | Open Access Rapidly photocurable silk fibroin sealant for clinical applications We report methacrylated silk fibroin sealant (Sil-MAS) with rapid crosslinkable, highly adhesive and biocompatible properties and demonstrate its versatility as medical glue. The excellence for physical properties of Sil-MAS is revealed via in vitro mechanical tests and ex vivo aorta pressure test. In in vivo biological tests on skin, liver, and blood vessels of rat, Sil-MAS showed a superb hemostatic and adhesive ability with high biocompatibility. Specifically, Sil-MAS strongly contributed to fast wound healing. Furthermore, we showed that Sil-MAS could be an ideal photocuring laparoscopic medical glue in laceration rabbit model of liver and stomach serosa using self-made endoscopic device.

Altemeier & Tomas Vaisar Scientific Reports 10, 10397 Research 25 June 2020 | Open Access Pre-innervated tissue-engineered muscle promotes a pro-regenerative microenvironment following volumetric muscle loss Das et al. create a bioengineered construct combining nerve and muscle cells on a biomimetic scaffold to improve recovery from volumetric muscle loss (VML). When implanted into a rat VML model, they report an increase in in vitro parameters of muscle fiber development and formation of neuromuscular junctions, which support in vivo observations of improved implanted cell survival and vascularization.

Sadler British Journal of Cancer, 1-3 News and Views | 25 June 2020 Cholesterol access aids pathogen spread Some cytosolic bacteria deform the plasma membrane to spread from cell to cell. Secretion of 25-hydroxy-cholesterol by macrophages has emerged as a protective response that depletes the cholesterol pool used by these bacteria to disseminate through epithelia. Norma W. Andrews Nature Microbiology 5, 881-882 Comments and Opinion 25 June 2020 | Open Access Looking backward in time to define the chronology of metastasis The timing of cancer metastasis has implications for treatment and prevention. Traditional forward-time views of metastasis assume it occurs late during evolution. However, looking backward in time reveals metastasis often occurs prior to clinical detection of primary tumors. Zheng Hu & Christina Curtis Nature Communications 11, 3213 Research Highlights | 25 June 2020 A combination therapy to keep hepatocellular carcinoma in check Katrina Ray Nature Reviews Gastroenterology & Hepatology, 1 News and Views | 25 June 2020 Starve a cold, and perhaps a cancer Stem cells tightly link their metabolism to cell fate decisions; however, how cancers co-opt and bypass metabolic pathways for growth advantage remains unclear. New evidence in this issue highlights how cancer stem cells avoid epigenetically driven differentiation by shutting down endogenous serine synthesis and becoming serine auxotrophs.
