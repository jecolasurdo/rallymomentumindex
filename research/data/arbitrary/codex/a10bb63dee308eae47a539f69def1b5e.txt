For people 40 and older without heart disease, doctors should discuss taking statins â€“ drugs which help control cholesterol levels â€“ based on their risk."The truth about clinical medicine is there is no black and white. It's all gray," said Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones, a writing committee member and chair of the department of preventive medicine at Northwestern University in Chicago, in a statement."That's why the emphasis in this document is making sure the patient and doctor are having well-informed discussions about the benefits and the potential risks of drug therapy."According to the AHA, the optimal level of LDL, or "bad" cholesterol, is less than 100 mg/dL.The last time the AHA and American College of Cardiology updated their guidelines was 2013, which made twice as many Americans eligible to take statins. A week after those guidelines were published, two Harvard Medical School professors questioned whether formulas used to determine high cholesterol might overestimate people's risk.Dr. Steven Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at The Cleveland Clinic and critic of the 2013 guidelines said the latest revisions represent a "great improvement" over the guidelines issued five years ago.Nissen said the key additions include thresholds for treating patients with high cholesterol, and better guidance for treating people over 75 years old and under 40."It's much more in line with what a lot of us think should have been done in 2013," he said.Follow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.About Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Corrections Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Terms of Service Your California Privacy Rights/Privacy Policy Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info/Cookie PolicyContact Us Help Center My Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop Reprints & Permissions Advertise Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Pinterest YouTube Reddit Flipboard RSS10Best Grateful Reviewed Thanksgiving.com Job Network Moonlighting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett ClassifiedsThe City The Wall StorytellersÂ© 2020 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC.
