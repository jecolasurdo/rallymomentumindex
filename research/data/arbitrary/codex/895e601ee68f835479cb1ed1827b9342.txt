Learn more Can Bing News search return the news last year? Ask Question Asked 2 years, 8 months ago Active 2 years, 4 months ago Viewed 412 times 2 I am looking into Bing News Search, and my testing results (with a free trial api-key) only contains articles in the last month. However I would like to get articles from last 1 or 2 years. for example: https://api.cognitive.microsoft.com/bing/v7.0/news/search?count=100&q=AMD+AND+product&since=1451606400&sortBy=Date The document only mentioned use a 'freshness' as the filter with day/week/month options but no year. Can I do that with Bing search? If I can, how can I do it? api bing microsoft-cognitive bing-news-search-api share | improve this question | follow | edited Oct 21 '17 at 5:39 Stevoisiak 12.9k1414 gold badges8686 silver badges141141 bronze badges asked Oct 21 '17 at 0:36 OscarOscar 75711 gold badge1010 silver badges1919 bronze badges add a comment | 1 Answer 1 Active Oldest Votes 0 0 There is no direct way. One alternate way to do this is by using trending topics with "sortBy" option and then jump to the last set of results using "offset" parameter. Another - less preferred - alternate way is to use datPublished field in JSON and parse results - may also help you to use "offset" parameter with bigger "count" number to go to slightly lower ranked results, which maybe older.
