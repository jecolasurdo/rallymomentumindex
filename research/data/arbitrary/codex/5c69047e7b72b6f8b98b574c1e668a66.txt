But once your credit score improves, transitioning to an unsecured card can offer you better benefits, including lucrative rewards.The content on this page is accurate as of the posting date; however, some of our partner offers may have expired. Please review our list of best credit cards, or use our CardMatch™ tool to find cards matched to your needs.Secured credit cards are great options for people who have no credit history, poor credit or need to rebuild their credit, but the benefits of a secured card are limited – offering minimal long-term value.With a secured credit card, your credit limit is low, typically equal to a security deposit required by the card issuer. Plus, rewards are typically not available.Nevertheless, with successful use of secured cards, your credit rating can be boosted by establishing positive payment history – paving the way to "graduate” to an unsecured card with the same bank. That can mean a higher credit line or limit, more perks and a chance to reap rewards. Plus, you can get the security deposit returned.Best secured cards that graduateDiscover it® SecuredBankAmericard Secured Credit CardNavy Federal Credit Union nRewards Secured Credit CardCapital One® Secured Mastercard®Citi® Secured Mastercard®First National Bank of Omaha Secured VisaHow do secured credit cards work?A secured credit card is guaranteed by a cash deposit that a cardholder makes when they open the account. Generally, the deposit will equal the new credit line. For example, if you are approved for a $500 credit limit, you'll need to deposit $500 to cover your spending.Essential reads, delivered weeklySubscribe to get the week's most important news in your inbox every week.Enter your email addressSubscribe By providing my email address, I agree to CreditCards.com's Privacy PolicyYour credit cards journey is officially underway.Keep an eye on your inbox—we'll be sending over your first message soon. This arrangement is used as collateral by the lender. If you don't pay your credit card bill, the bank will deduct funds from your deposit to cover your unpaid expenses.For people with no credit, poor credit or who are rebuilding their credit, it can be challenging to get approved for an unsecured credit card. Less-qualified borrowers will build confidence and credit history by paying bills on time and by managing spending.Secured cards are ideal for these situations because the cash deposit you put down vastly reduces the amount of risk the issuer takes. If you charge up a large balance and are delinquent on your debts, your secured card issuer has the right to take what you owe from the funds it has held in deposit.A well-managed secured card will establish a record of on-time payments, which is an important factor that impacts your creditworthiness.See related: The factors of a FICO credit scoreSecured credit cards can also help improve your credit, if you pay on time each month. When you pay on time, you are demonstrating good credit habits, which are being reported to the major credit bureaus. This new information can improve your credit score.Tip: Limit your spending and do not charge excessively on your secured card. The sooner your statement balances are paid down, the quicker you may be eligible for an unsecured card with your current card issuer, or even new credit card issuers.How do secured cards differ from unsecured credit cards?A secured credit card requires a refundable security deposit. These funds are not utilized when purchases are made using the secured card – unless the account balance is not paid. Essentially, if charges are paid on time, the money you provided for security is not depleted. But if you do not pay the balance on your credit card, the balance will be taken from your security deposit to cover the unpaid charges.In the case of an unsecured card, a security deposit is not required. Instead of money being taken from a security deposit, the cardholder is extended a line of credit and charged interest and fees for balances that are paid late.Secured cards that graduateSome credit card issuers will re-evaluate your credit history (usually after six months to a year) to determine if you qualify for an unsecured product. If this assessment is favorable, the account will transition and you'll get your deposit back. If not, it remains secured.Your secured card offers a credit limit equal to the amount of your refundable deposit – until you get approved to "graduate” to an unsecured credit card. The next step is getting an unsecured card with a credit line.The amount of time to wait before graduating to an unsecured credit card can vary by issuer. You can expect to wait up to one year, but some lenders consider an upgrade to an unsecured card in as little as five or six months.When transitioning to an unsecured card, it is customary for lenders to be conservative with a credit limit. As your credit score increases, you may be able to request a higher credit limit.See related: 6 things to know before requesting a credit-line increaseHere's a sampling of secured cards and what's required to upgrade to an unsecured card:Secured card nameGraduation requirementsDiscover it® SecuredAccount reviewed after at least 8 months of positive payment historyBankAmericard Secured Credit CardNo official timeline, but reports indicate account may graduate at 12 monthsNavy Federal Credit Union nRewards Secured Credit CardAccount will be regularly reviewed (starting 6 months after account opening) for deposit return and upgrade to cashRewards cardCapital One® Secured Mastercard®*No official policy, but some users have reported success graduating after first yearCiti® Secured Mastercard®*Account is reviewed after 18 months (some report graduation at 12 months)First National Bank of Omaha Secured VisaAccount is reviewed after 11 monthsOther options for graduating from a secured cardWhile not all secured credit cards automatically review an account to graduate, you can often request that your issuer upgrade you to a different product.
