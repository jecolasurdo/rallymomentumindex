While the position of first lady is not legally or constitutionally provided for in many countries, many presidencies cater for the Office of the First Lady, through which the holder is facilitated to champion social causes. The Organisation of African First Ladies for Development (OAFLAD), created in 2002, brings together First Ladies of Africa 'to advocate for policies that make health services accessible and laws that boost women and youth empowerment'. OAFLAD is currently led by First Lady of Burkina Faso, Adjoavi Sika Kabore, who is deputised by her Kenyan counterpart Margaret Kenyatta. A first lady by definition is the wife of the head of state, and it therefore follows that most African nations led by a male president, have a first lady. SUGGESTED READING: Celebrating African First Ladies In this article, we will share updates from the continent's First Ladies as they take on different roles to complement their government's policies. Ethiopia First Lady sings about coronavirus Ethiopian First Lady Zinash Tayachew aside recent donations towards the coronavirus fight, has released a gospel song seeking divine intervention in the battle against the pandemic.

The song was released on Tuesday and is titled Maren – an Amharic word meaning "have mercy on us.” The first lady sings on a stage with a cross behind her at a point kneeling and praying for "God not to abandon her people.” The song does not directly refer to the virus, but has phrases like "do not abandon us during this time when the world is terrorised by bad news.” Originally uploaded on the YouTube handle of one Joyce Girma Official" it has raked some 6,000 plus views as at the time of publication of this article.

Zambian official fired for disrespecting First Lady A mayor in Zambia has been relieved of his position in the ruling Patriotic Front (PF) party, after he reportedly refused to greet the country's First Lady. The state-owned Daily Mail newspaper reported that Kitwe mayor Christopher Kang'ombe was suspended from the party last week and has now been stripped of his position as the PF's vice-chairman in the Copperbelt Province. Kang'ombe is accused of gross indiscipline that includes failing to line up to greet Esther Lungu when she recently visited the area, and refusing to be introduced at a public event attended by the First Lady. "During the visit of the First Lady, Kang'ombe was offered a back seat which he refused...After the church service, he refused to line up and greet the First Lady," reads part of his suspension letter, according to the Daily Mail. "When the First Lady's official envoy started off, he pulled away from the convoy and instead drove away,” it adds. Kang'ombe however still retains his mayoral post.

Appeal to criminals in Zambia Zambia's First Lady Esther Lungu on Tuesday broke down in tears as she appealed to perpetrators of gas attacks that have spread across the country, to stop. "I'm making an earnest appeal to the people that are behind this gassing – to an extent of gassing innocent schoolchildren, innocent families....I am appealing, as the mother of the nation, I am appealing...," the First Lady told a group of women, before falling to her knees as she cried. Police are struggling to arrest unidentified people that have been targeting homes and schools, spraying victims with a gas that leaves them unconscious.
