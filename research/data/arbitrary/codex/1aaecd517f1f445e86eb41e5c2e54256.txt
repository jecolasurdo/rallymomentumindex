Check out what's clicking today in entertainment.Eagles songwriter Don Henley asked Congress on Tuesday to "Take It to the Limit” to protect artists against online pirating, wading into a copyright fight pitting Hollywood and the recording industry against big tech platforms like Google's YouTube.The blockbuster hitmaker of the 1970s testified online from his home before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee weighing possible changes to a 1998 copyright law. The law allows holders of copyrighted material to formally ask parties they believe have taken their content without permission to remove it. The parties can dispute the claim. If they comply promptly with the request, there are no legal consequences. Otherwise, they may be subject to criminal penalties.Henley said the law is weak and needs to be changed to make it more effective in stopping online piracy.LED ZEPPELIN WINS 'STAIRWAY TO HEAVEN' COPYRIGHT INFRINGEMENT CASE Don Henley performs at "All In For The Gambler: Kenny Rogers' Farewell Concert Celebration" at Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Tenn. (AP)The so-called "notice and takedown” system under the copyright law is used by the movie and recording industries, entertainment software makers and book authors to pursue tech platforms, universities and other facilitators of file-sharing.Henley called the copyright law "a relic of a MySpace era in a TikTok world.” With hundreds of millions of takedown notices sent, for every link taken down "a dozen more pop up in its place,” he said. The system "still allows Big Tech to rake in revenue” after repeated copyright infringements, Henley said.The copyright battle is being spotlighted in Congress at a time when U.S. tech giants are in an escalating feud with President Trump and Republican lawmakers, who accuse platforms such as Twitter, Google and Facebook of suppressing conservative viewpoints. The dispute boiled over last week when Twitter attached warnings to some of Trump's tweets on mail-in voting and the use of force against people protesting the police-involved death of George Floyd.Trump, who is Twitter's most prominent user, responded by issuing an executive order intended to chip away at the tech platforms' legal shield for speech content they carry.EAGLES' JOE WALSH, STRIPPER EX BATTLED SEVERE ADDICTIONS TO COCAINE AND ALCOHOL, BOOK CLAIMSIn the debate over online pirating, the subcommittee chairman, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., made his leanings clear. He said creative industries have been "absolutely decimated” by the economic fallout of the pandemic as well as the online pirating of copyrighted material that hasn't slowed down.

"The current system is failing and it's failing badly.”He confided that the first live music performance he saw, when he lived in Nashville, was the Eagles. The rock group, with Henley as singer, drummer and songwriter, produced some of the best-selling albums of all time in the 1970s.The other senators who attended the hearing, Democrats Chris Coons of Delaware and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, expressed support for changes to update the copyright law.THE EAGLES SURPASS MICHAEL JACKSON FOR NO. 1 ALBUM OF ALL TIME The Eagles perform at the band's induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on Jan. 13, 1998. (Reuters)Copyright holders maintain that some network operators have manipulated Internet-provider addresses in a way to make other networks appear responsible for the file-sharing. Entertainment industries have been pushing tech platforms to do more themselves to police content that violates copyright.On the other side, users of the content have accused copyright holders of alleging infringement where it doesn't exist. Internet companies say they have worked actively with the creative industries to block access to illegal content and protect the copyrights.Jonathan Berroya, interim president and CEO of the major trade group Internet Association, testified that the "overwhelming majority” of copyright infringement takes place on foreign tech platforms outside the reach of U.S. law and is not conducted by U.S. companies.CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APPTech companies themselves are in a golden age of creating content and investing in others' projects, Berroya said.They do not want to profit from illegally taken content, he said. Given the huge scale of piracy, tech platforms and the entertainment industries need to pool their resources and use new technology to identify violations.The Associated Press contributed to this report.On Our RadarEmrata's BEST shotsTMZ Star's REVENGE bodyTMZ SHOCKING Harrison Ford audio TMZKate, 46, STUNS in bikiniTMZ Meghan calls out the QUEEN Inside Kelly's MEGA mansion TMZReality star dating WHO?TMZOn Our RadarEmrata's BEST shotsTMZ Star's REVENGE bodyTMZ SHOCKING Harrison Ford audio TMZKate, 46, STUNS in bikiniTMZ Meghan calls out the QUEEN Inside Kelly's MEGA mansion TMZReality star dating WHO?TMZTrending in EntertainmentSharon Stone mourns ex Steve Bing's death: 'This is really hard'Justin Bieber sues 2 Twitter users accusing him of sexual assault for defamation in $20 million suit: reportMindy Kaling celebrates 'very special' birthday with rare photo of daughter KatherineElton John's ex-wife, Renate Blauel, seeking injunction against singerCoronavirusU.S.CrimeMilitaryEducationTerrorImmigrationEconomyPersonal FreedomsFox News InvestigatesWorldU.N.ConflictsTerrorismDisastersGlobal EconomyEnvironmentReligionScandalsOpinionPoliticsExecutiveSenateHouseJudiciaryForeign PolicyPollsElectionsEntertainmentCelebrity NewsMoviesTV NewsMusic NewsStyle NewsEntertainment VideoBusinessMarketsPoliticsTechnologyFeaturesBusiness LeadersLifestyleFood + DrinkCars + TrucksTravel + OutdoorsHouse + HomeFitness + Well-beingStyle + BeautyFamilyFaithScienceArchaeologyAir & SpacePlanet EarthWild NatureNatural ScienceDinosaursTechSecurityInnovationDronesComputersVideo GamesMilitary TechHealthCoronavirusHealthy LivingMedical ResearchMental HealthCancerHeart HealthChildren's HealthTVShowsPersonalitiesWatch LiveFull EpisodesShow ClipsNews Clips About Contact UsCareersFox Around the WorldAdvertise With UsMedia RelationsCorporate InformationComplianceSupplier Diversity Other Fox NationFox News ShopFox News GoFox News RadioNewslettersAlertsPodcastsApps & ProductsFacebookTwitterFlipboardGoogle+InstagramRSSEmailFox NewsNew Terms of UseUpdated Privacy PolicyDo Not Sell my Personal InformationClosed Captioning PolicyHelpContact UsAccessibility StatementThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2020 FOX News Network, LLC.
