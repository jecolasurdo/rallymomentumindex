Chris Lehman Members of the Electoral College cast their votes for president Monday in state capitals across the country, including in Oregon and Washington. It's usually a routine event, but this year's political turmoil means the voting is getting extra attention. Most of the Electoral College drama revolves around whether Republican delegates pledged to Donald Trump will switch to someone else. That's not an issue in Oregon and Washington, where Hillary Clinton handily won each state. But Washington state delegate Levi Guerra said she's willing to ditch Clinton in favor of a Republican alternative, should a consensus candidate emerge. "By doing that, it is opening the door to other Republican electors to being willing to cast their vote opposing Trump,” said Guerra. The number of electors in each state is based on the number in its congressional delegation: 12 for Washington and seven for Oregon. Each state's electors will gather mid-day in their respective states' capitol buildings. Oregon's ceremony begins at 11 a.m. in the Oregon Senate chambers.
