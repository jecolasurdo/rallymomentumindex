This very much depends on how quickly you make your decision and the availability of places at the University you wish to attend. However, a sudden change of University when you've only just arrived here can be very stressful so you are advised to discuss this with a Student Adviser in the Student Support Team who can advise and ensure the appropriate procedures are followed. If you are a Tier 4 Student and wish to study at another University then you will have to return home and apply to that University, once you tell us that you no longer wish to study here at Bangor, under Home Office rules, we will need to withdraw your Visa.
