Erectile dysfunction is a common condition that affects an estimated 30 million males in the United States.People with erectile dysfunction find it difficult reach or maintain an erection, even during sexual arousal. The condition can have a variety of causes, but it usually relates to poor blood flow to the penis.During arousal, the arteries leading to the penis expand, allowing more blood to flow through it. The veins leading blood away from the penis also become narrower. The greater blood flow in and restricted blood flow out of the penis cause it to harden, leading to erection.In erectile dysfunction, however, blood flow to the penis can be too low and disrupt the ability to get or maintain an erection. Drugs such as Viagra relax smooth muscles and increase blood flow to the penis, making it easier to get or keep an erection.Viagra can only work during sexual arousal. If a person is not in a state of arousal, Viagra will not be able to cause an erection.Alternatives to ViagraThere are many other ways to treat erectile dysfunction.Viagra is a phosphodiesterase (PDE) 5 inhibitor.
