The storm halted the printing of newspapers in New Jersey, stopped WNYC and other stations from broadcasting on their AM radio frequencies, put a muzzle on the Gawker Web site by flooding its Internet service provider and pulled intrepid television reporters off streets with its high winds and deep water."We knew that getting around was going to be tough, we just didn't realize, nor did anybody, how tough it would be,” said Michael Jack, the president and general manager of WNBC. Mr. Jack added that his reporters had "three laments” in this storm: the water, high winds and restrictions on movement, like the closings of bridges and tunnels.Some stations found the conditions to be so daunting that they pulled back reporters during the height of the coverage. NY1, the all-news cable channel in New York City based downtown, instructed some crews to leave dangerous areas on Monday; other reporters sought temporary shelter in various places because the streets were impassable.At a time like this, many news organizations like the Weather Channel made use of Twitter and Facebook to find user-generated photos and videos. A few fakes surfaced, like one photo purporting to show a shark swimming through a neighborhood. But as soon as one person posted the photo, thinking it was taken recently, several other people virtually shouted it down, clarifying that it was a hoax.Radio stations, one of the most reliable sources of information for people without power, were also impeded by flooding on Monday. Two news radio stations, WNYC and WINS, lost their AM frequencies but continued to broadcast on FM. WNYC's transmitter "is in a swamp, and it's flooded,” said Laura R. Walker, the chief executive of New York Public Radio, which operates the station. She added the organization had anticipated the power failure and warned listeners ahead of time. The station's Lower Manhattan studio lost power on Monday night. But a backup generator kicked in immediately and coverage was not stopped.A Region Battered and Hurting — Day 140 PhotosView Slide Show ›Michael Kirby Smith for The New York Times.The Daily News was not so lucky. The paper's headquarters are in the heart of the flood zone at Four New York Plaza in Lower Manhattan. The paper relocated its operations to its printing plant in Liberty View, in New Jersey, and continued to publish editions on Tuesday and Wednesday, according to a spokesman, Ken Frydman. In the meantime, The Daily News temporarily shifted its Web operations to The Associated Press offices, where the newspaper was previously located.The New York Post still appeared on select newsstands in Manhattan, and a spokeswoman for The New York Times said the paper had "very limited distribution” on Tuesday in Manhattan because the bridges and tunnels were closed. Trucks delivering The Times from the paper's College Point facility in Queens could only gain access to parts of Queens, Brooklyn and Long Island that were not affected by road closings. The Wall Street Journal and The Times compensated for suspended delivery by making their content free online.In New Jersey, newspapers worked under some of the most grueling conditions. Martin Gottlieb, editor of The Record of North Jersey, said on Monday that the 215-person newsroom continued to work even as its lights flickered seven or eight times throughout the afternoon, right up until deadline. The Record wanted to continue to print the paper at its plant in Rockaway, but that plant lost power in the early evening and the storm later tore a hole in the building, so the paper had to move its printing to The Asbury Park Press in Freehold.Things were more troubling for Newhouse Newspapers. The Star-Ledger in Newark did not publish a print edition on Tuesday and directed subscribers to nj.com for news updates. Through the storm, its Web site, nj.com/starledger, remained suspended in time and on Tuesday afternoon its home page still read "State forecast: a catastrophe.”Gannett papers seemed to fare better. The company moved the printing of its New York editions of USA Today to plants in New England and then delivered them by truck to hotels and retailers in Manhattan, a Gannett spokesman said. The company's printing plant in Asbury Park helped with publishing two papers, The Journal News in Westchester and The Poughkeepsie Journal, which are typically printed elsewhere.The storm did not spare Web publications. Flooding in Lower Manhattan forced the server for Gawker's sites to shut down. Nick Denton, the chief of Gawker Media, sent an e-mail to his staff Tuesday warning them that "We have little idea whether it will be hours or days until our servers there are back online.” He switched the company's sites over to Tumblr and published articles via Facebook and Twitter. "Embarrassing, but better than going dark,” Mr. Denton wrote in his memo.Those media outlets that were able to maintain operations tried to provide comfort to New Yorkers. The WNYC host Brian Lehrer was widely praised on Monday night for his coolheaded coverage of the havoc outside. On Tuesday morning, Mr. Lehrer had a resident of "Sesame Street,” Elmo, speak to reassure children about their safety amid the storm. The station, like many others, will continue with its nonstop coverage in the days to come."Our job is just beginning,” said Ms. Walker of WNYC. "People are going to need us more than ever.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite IndexSite Information Navigation© 2020 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpSubscriptions
