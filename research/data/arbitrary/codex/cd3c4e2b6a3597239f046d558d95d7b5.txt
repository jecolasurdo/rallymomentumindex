COVID-19 Convalescent Plasma Donation Site UofSC's Student Health Services and School of Medicine and The Blood Connection have partnered to collect COVID-19 convalescent plasma at the health center. Convalescent plasma donations are part of a national study by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Mayo Clinic. Remote Health and Wellness Resources We have health and wellness resources available for students, faculty and staff that are working and studying remotely. These include stress management resources like meditation and yoga; health resources like telemedicine; and counseling and psychiatry services. Check back often as we will be adding things regularly to this web page. Center for Health and Well-Being Earns Top Award at Annual Architecture Awards Quackenbush Architects + Planners with Perkins + Will earned the Honor award for new construction for their work on University of South Carolina's Center for Health and Well-Being from the American Institute of Architects, South Carolina chapter. Flu Shots! Student Health Services will have flu shots available in the fall at the Allergy, Immunization and Travel office in the first floor of the Center for Health and Well-Being, room 104. Students, faculty and staff are encouraged to get their flu shot to help protect them and the Carolina family from this season's flu strains. Mobile Flu Clinics are Coming to You This year, Student Health Services wants to make it as simple as possible for students, faculty and staff to get their flu shots. We are planning a series of mobile flu clinics around the UofSC-Columbia campus this fall. Measles Update Our efforts at the UofSC to ensure to the maximum extent possible that our students are protected with measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine will no doubt help us reduce the chance of an outbreak. However, the CDC expects the measles outbreak to grow rapidly over the next few months. Wellness Guides & Materials Read our guides and learn about living a healthy lifestyle on campus.
