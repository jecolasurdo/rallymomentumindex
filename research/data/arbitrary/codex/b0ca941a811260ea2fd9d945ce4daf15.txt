The article, Best secured credit cards in 2020, discusses whether secured credit cards help consumers raise their credit. "It could be assumed that a likely correlation exists between secured credit card usage and improved creditworthiness; however, to assert such with a conviction would be tenuous because other factors also play a role," said Das. "The main thing however is that people new to credit or attempting to repair bad credit should consider using secured credit cards. While solely relying on such a card may not be the optimum tactic, this could be a move in the right direction to help consumers improve or raise their credit."
