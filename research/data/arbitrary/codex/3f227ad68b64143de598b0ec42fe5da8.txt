The introduction of the pension freedoms in 2015 means there are more ways to retire to suit your lifestyle and aspirations. Take the 25pc tax-free cash that has always been available on pensions. Before the reforms, this money was available but you often had to sign up to an annuity at that point as well. If you did not need that income immediately or wanted to leave your options open for the future, the products on offer made this difficult. Annuities work by taking your pension savings and paying out a guaranteed income for life in return. They are still right for some people, of course, but committing to an annuity means less flexibility with your pension money. It is crucial to plan carefully, in particular with drawdown As an alternative to an annuity, the changes have now opened up pension drawdown to more people. With drawdown, in addition to being able to take up to a quarter of your pot tax-free from the age of 55, you have the option to take a regular income from your pension and keep the rest invested. You also have the freedom to alter your investment choices and the level of income you receive to suit your needs. Basically, you choose how much you want to take, when you want to take it and how often. You can even take additional lump sums, although anything over 25pc will be taxable like normal income. Another significant consequence of pension freedoms has been to make drawdown more attractive when it comes to passing your money on. With drawdown, money left in your pension pot when you die can be passed to your family. Money in a drawdown plan remains outside your estate – and therefore potentially protected from inheritance tax.
