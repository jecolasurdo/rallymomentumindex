What parents are saying about how Mendability is helping their children overcome sensory processing problems "My son was diagnosed with Sensory Development Disorder. The year after we started Mendability, Sean started to try new foods, he took a bite of the apple and banana and also ate porridge at the daycare.” – Zhana D. (Ukraine) parent of 5-year-old boy "I want to share a great change in my son after a week of Mendability. He hated hand blower dryers at public restrooms. This week, he asked me to use the hand blower and introduced his hands on it without any sign of fear or wanting to cover his ears. I'm very happy about that!” – Carmen C. (California) parent of a 6-year-old boy "My boy always refused to eat warm food. Not even a little warm because for him it was like extremely hot that could burn his mouth. So when I cook, I have to put his food in the refrigerator to cool off. Since last week, he has been eating warm food and even warmer than what I expected. Things are truly getting better for my boy since we started Mendability.” – Rosa O. (Missouri) parent of 5-year-old boy "My son's craving for lotion and toothpaste has reduced a lot. Now he plays more with water.” – Jabeen A. (UK) parent of a 6-year-old boy "Did the multisensory protocol after school. I used lemon essential oil yesterday and today. He is liking smelling the lemon oil so I went with lemons for the multisensory. I put fresh lemon juice on his lips at the end and he licked them and DID NOT gag! This is huge for my child. He has severe oral motor aversions. Day 2 is rockin already!” – Sadie W. (Illinois) Parent of a 10-year-old boy "My son was pretty self-injurious until we very intensively met his sensory needs and allowed him to self-modulate. Providing the sensory input that my son sought has made a HUGE difference for him. And he loves the Mendability exercises!” – Alice P. (North Carolina) Parent of a 16-year-old boy "My major concern for [my son] was his behaviour while waiting at airports and on the plane. I want to share my joy – our trip was really fun filled, and the main reason was that there was a lot of change in [my son's] sensory needs. Last year's trip was miserable, his aggression was so bad that my arms were bruised due to his bitting. [This year he] behaved so well. He was very calm in crowds, tolerated sounds and noises for sometime. He didn't bother us at all during the flights and at the airports. This is all due to Mendability!” – Ayesha A.
