(NYSE:VCRA), a recognized leader in clinical communication and workflow solutions, is hosting a webinar with Hardin Memorial Health (HMH) about hands-free communication and how it improves the safety and well-being of patients and care teams. The virtual event is Tuesday, June 30, from 12-1 p.m. ET, and will be moderated by Rhonda Collins, DNP, RN, FAAN, Chief Nursing Officer of Vocera. "Hands-free communication has been a game changer for us,” said Deanna Parker, MBA, MHA, BSN, assistant vice president of emergency services at HMH. "It has helped us improve clinician collaboration and satisfaction as well as elevate patient care, safety and experience.” During the webinar, Parker will share how the emergency department at HMH implemented the wearable Vocera Badge while onboarding new care team members and serving thousands of patients during a $15 million construction project. Collaboration between clinical staff and the IT department led to successful adoption of the solution. The strategic approach to deployment and training was executed so well that within four months, patient satisfaction scores and left without being seen (LWBS) rates showed significant improvements. Additionally, the hospital has seen positive results in multiple sepsis metrics. Parker will share her team's best practices before and during the COVID-19 crisis as the ED redesigned clinical workflows and began using the Vocera Badge under personal protective equipment (PPE) to triage and care for patients quickly and safely.
