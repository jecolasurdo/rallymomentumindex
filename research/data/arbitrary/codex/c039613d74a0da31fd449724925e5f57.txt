Shivani SharmaOne of the reasons why viral infections can be difficult to treat is the high mutation rate displayed by many viruses, which can sometimes allow them to evade our immune systems and develop resistance to drugs. In this article, Shivani looks into the evidence gathered by scientists around the world on mutations in the genome of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Posted on May 26, 2020 in Health & Medicine, Molecular Biology & Research A real-time molecular investigation of coronavirus entry into human cells Susheela SrinivasThe COVID-19 pandemic has set off a wave of research activities across the world, aimed at finding clues that would allow us to design effective therapeutics and vaccines. In one such effort, a team of researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, have initiated a study into the molecular dynamics of the process via which the novel coronavirus attaches to cells of the human respiratory system. Posted on Apr 13, 2020 in Health & Medicine, Molecular Biology & Research Solving the mystery of an orphan enzyme Gargi DeshmukhThis new study from researchers at IISER Pune delves into the potential biological function of an 'orphan enzyme' using a variety of biochemical, molecular, and structural techniques. Siddhesh Kamat, the Principal Investigator who led this project was recently awarded the EMBO Young Investigators Award as well as the Merck Young Scientist Award. Posted on Jan 18, 2020 in Biochemistry, Molecular Biology & Research Scientists capture the misfolding of rogue proteins in action Sumeet KulkarniResearchers at the National Center for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bengaluru have used a combination of techniques to unravel the mystery of how prions misfold. Prions are proteins that undergo structural changes to form compound assemblies called amyloid fibrils, which can lead to fatal infectious neurodegenerative diseases like the Mad Cow disease and other Transmissible Spongiform Encelopathies in mammals. Posted on Sep 19, 2019 in Biochemistry, Molecular Biology & Research Fighting superbugs using echidna milk Annapoorna P KResearchers in Hyderabad have successfully expressed and purified a novel antimicrobial protein from the milk of an egg-laying mammal, echidna, using a simple bacterial system. The protein displays antibacterial action against a wide spectrum of bacteria and could be useful in battling drug-resistant pathogens. Posted on Jun 26, 2019 in Microbiology, Molecular Biology & Research Towards personalized therapy for Indian gallbladder cancer patients Bidisha GhoshGallbladder cancer has a high rate of incidence in Indian populations and a heavy mortality rate. Now, researchers from ACTREC, Mumbai, have pinpointed a pair of genetic mutations in gallbladder cancer patients, which may serve as potential drug targets for treatment. Posted on May 06, 2019 in Health & Medicine, Molecular Biology & Research How stem cells retain their "stem” ness: The science of staying uncommitted Aditi JainSince their initial discovery several decades ago, stem cells have faced intensive study due to their potential medical applications and fascinating biology. A question that has long interested scientists is how do stem cells continue to remain in an undifferentiated or 'uncommitted' state, unlike every other cell type in the body? Now, a new study from researchers at the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS) sheds light on this unique problem.
