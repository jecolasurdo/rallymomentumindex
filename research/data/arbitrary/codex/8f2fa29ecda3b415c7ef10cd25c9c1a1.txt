Most teachers know that sensory issues are common with students diagnosed with autism, but sensory needs are also super common with children who have experienced trauma. This post will focus on students with sensory concerns, who do not necessarily have autism, because there are a few discrepancies between the two. But first! What are sensory problems anyway? Everybody has 5 senses – taste, touch, smell, sight, and hearing. When the brain struggles to organize and respond to information perceived in those senses, we end up with sensory problems. Children can be over-responsive, under-responsive, or both. When the issues are more severe, children can be diagnosed with sensory processing disorder. However, symptoms can still be problematic without being diagnosed. Sensory problems encompass a broad range of issues. This makes it difficult to write about every single one in just one blog post, so we are just going to start with a basic overview. Sensory issues most often develop in one of three ways: in utero, during birth, or during infancy. Many children who have experienced trauma develop sensory problems when they do not have a properly stimulating environment during infancy or toddlerhood. (This is NOT what causes sensory problems in a child with autism!) Here are a few common ways that sensory problems might develop in children exposed to trauma: Living in a environment that is too loud or overstimulatingLiving in an environment that is understimulating (being left in a crib or high chair all day)A caregiver does not consistently and appropriately respond to their criesBasic needs are not met (such as diaper changes, cuddling, or food)Any kind of abuseLack of healthy, appropriate adult interaction When children do not have their basic sensory needs met as infants, their brains do not learn how to respond appropriately to sensory stimuli. This means they can struggle to process literally anything that is perceived by any of the 5 senses, which is almost every experience that we have! This creates a need within the child to be adverse to certain stimuli, to seek out stimuli, or a combination of both. The deep, hard-wired need for this is what can cause behavior problems in the classroom (or at home). A child who has an aversion to certain stimuli might... Cry when they hear a loud noiseRefuse to eat food with certain textures or flavorsRefuse to wear certain clothes (denim or other stiff fabric is a common complaint)Throw tantrums in busy, crowded places (like a full gymnasium or an amusement park) A child who seeks out certain stimuli might... Constantly touch things they should not touchIntentionally make loud noises by banging things, turning the volume up, or even yellingSpin or twirlSeem unable to sit still (This is a really common one)Climb or jump off of high placesChew on things (clothing, pencils, toys) when no longer developmentally appropriateFidget Sensory issues can manifest themselves in many different ways. These lists are just a few common ones that a teacher might see in a classroom. The good news is that with occupational therapy (from a professional), brains can be re-trained to process sensory stimuli in a healthy way. It is important to realize that children cannot necessarily control these responses. A child who can't seem to sit still quite literally CANNOT sit still. Their brains won't let them. They feel uncomfortable in their bodies unless they feed their sensory needs. A common response to any of these issues is to discipline or punish a student. But we can't do that. Punishment won't work to stop these behaviors. When sensory issues come into play, we have to remember that these children are not trying to be naughty or defiant. They are trying to help themselves feel calm and relaxed, but many children do not have the words to articulate that. But how do we tell the difference between a sensory problem and a behavior problem? First, this website has a simple, basic checklist to help you better identify behaviors. Second, just watch your student. What is happening around the student when you see behaviors? Is something triggering a sensory response? What is the student's attitude like? Are they angry or defiant or do they want to please you? My Secret Trick One of my little tricks for distinguishing between behavior problems and sensory problems is observing the child's attitude. Generally, when a behavior is related to a sensory problem, a child seems stressed, but not necessarily angry or defiant. You can tell they want to be obedient and listen to your instructions, but they just can't seem to follow through. One student that I had just could not stop spinning and twirling when she was supposed to be standing still in a busy environment (like lining up in the lunchroom). She was bright and sweet, but no matter what we did, the spinning would not stop. After she started to receive therapy to address her sensory needs, the spinning stopped! Her body and mind did not feel comfortable in the stimulating environment, but twirling helped her to regulate herself so she felt calmer and more relaxed. When her occupational therapist was able to provide therapy to help retrain her brain to regulate in a healthy way, her behavior shifted radically in just a year. If you suspect that your student might have sensory processing disorder, follow your school's procedures for discussing it with the parent. Many schools also have an occupational therapist who can help! If you think that your student might have a behavior problem, not a sensory problem, check out my 10 Days of Behavior series!
