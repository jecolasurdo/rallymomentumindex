Turns 30You're Doing It Wrong: Vitamins—Gwyneth Paltrow's Nutritionist Weighs inThese are the pills you should be takingBy Alanah Joseph Jan 24, 2017 1:00 PMTagsKim KardashianKanye WestGwyneth PaltrowKate HudsonDiet And FitnessHealthMolly SimsCara DelevingneKhloe KardashianIt's what's on the inside that counts.It's no secret that your diet has a large effect on your hair, skin and general appearance. Drinking water and eating right can be the solution to many of our dreaded insecurities, including acne, dark circles around the eyes, weak nails—this list goes on and on. What do you do to better balance your nutrition? Most of us walk into the vitamin/wellness aisle at the grocery store only to be overwhelmed by the number of brands and bottles with seemingly random letters and numbers. C'mon on, B-13, D3, CoQ10? It may be healthy, but it's not straightforward. Once you finally decide on a host of pills that you promise you're going to swallow every day (even though you may only remember for two weeks...let's be honest), you start to wonder, "Is this actually working?" Unlike skin cream, the results will vary, making it harder to know if your vitamin routine is actually making a difference, especially when some say it's a waste of time.photosBest Skin-Care Products for Every AgeWe're making it easier (for all of us).

Additionally, the toxic load we are faced with these days is worse than ever, and added vitamins, nutrients and minerals can help our bodies become more resilient. Of course, supplements do not replace a healthy, wholesome diet and are best when paired with nutrient-dense meals."His Daily Dose:D3 for enhancing muscle strength and bolstering the immune system.Fish Oil for protection against inflammation, cardiovascular health, better vision and stronger hair, skin and nails.Probiotics for healthy digestion and to consume bad bacteria.Magnesium for metabolic function and easing tension or pain in muscles.Glutathoine for energy production and antioxidants.photosBest New Beauty Products of 2017Elissa Goodman Introducing "Elissa's Essentials" my essential supplements in one pack ??

(@elissagoodman) on Jan 7, 2017 at 2:16pm PST Celebrity Clients: Kate Hudson, Molly Sims, Jonathan BennettElissa Goodman's Recommendation:"Above anything, I recommend eating minimum of 6-8 servings of vegetables daily. I am a minimalist and don't believe an extreme amount of vitamins and supplements are necessary, especially if you eat a well-balanced diet. I also believe that a lot of vitamins on the mass market are not so great and am very particular about brands I recommend."Her Daily Dose:"Elissa's Essentials" supplement kit makes choosing the right blend of vitamin/supplements easy.
