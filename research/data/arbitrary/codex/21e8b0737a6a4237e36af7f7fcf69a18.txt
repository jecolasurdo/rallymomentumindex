What can I use it for on short notice?Answer: You can use money from your flexible spending account for out-of-pocket medical expenses, such as your health insurance deductible, co-payments, prescription drugs, and vision and dental care. You probably won't be able to schedule an appointment with your doctor or dentist on such short notice, but there are several things you can use your FSA money for in a hurry, including some drugstore items you may not have realized are eligible expenses.10 Myths About Health Savings AccountsFor example, you can use your FSA money to stock up on contact lenses and contact lens solution, as well as eyeglasses and prescription sunglasses. Or tap the account to buy thermometers, blood pressure monitors, prenatal vitamins, breast pumps, sunscreen with an SPF of 15 or higher, hot/cold packs, first aid kits, bandages, orthopedic braces and even an acupressure neck pillow. "What most consumers don't know is that the eligible FSA expenses extend beyond basic medical supplies to include items like batteries for a hearing aid, glucose test strips, acupuncture, and even wheelchairs and walking aids,” says Leslie Antunes, chief growth officer of Alegeus, which administers FSAs for employers.AdvertisementAdvertisement - Article continues belowAdvertisement - Article continues belowMany drugstore items don't require a prescription, but some of them do. See FSAStore.com's eligibility list for details. FSAStore.com specializes in selling items that are FSA-eligible. Some FSA plans provide a debit card that makes it easy to buy eligible items at the drugstore.The FSA deadline to use-it-or-lose-it varies among employers. More than one-third of employers offer a grace period until March 15 to use the previous year's FSA money, while nearly half let you roll over $500 from one year to the next, according to a study by the Society of Human Resource Management. And about 17% offer neither a rollover nor a grace period, requiring people to use up the money in their accounts by December 31. It's not unusual for workers to miss the deadline, forfeiting a total of about $400 million annually, says Antunes.50 Ways to Save on Health CareAdvertisementspendingtax planninghealth insuranceShare via EmailShare on FacebookShare on TwitterShare on LinkedInAdvertisementMost PopularWhat Are the Income Tax Brackets for 2020 vs. 2019?tax bracketsWhat Are the Income Tax Brackets for 2020 vs. 2019?The IRS unveiled the 2020 tax brackets, and it's never too early to start planning to minimize your future tax bill.June 20, 2020Tax Changes and Key Amounts for the 2020 Tax Yeartax lawTax Changes and Key Amounts for the 2020 Tax YearAmericans are facing a long list of tax changes for the 2020 tax year...and it's never too early to start thinking about next year's return.June 22, 202013 Reasons You Will Regret an RV in Retirementretirement13 Reasons You Will Regret an RV in RetirementRV-loving retirees talk about the downsides of spending retirement in a motorhome, travel trailer, fifth wheel or other recreational vehicle.June 8, 2020RecommendedWhat to Do If You Get a Stimulus Check for a Deceased PersontaxesWhat to Do If You Get a Stimulus Check for a Deceased PersonThe IRS sent more than 1 million stimulus checks to dead people.
