What's the difference and why choose one option over the other. It can be confusing. It's good to look at goals.The goals of elder law estate planning generally meet the desires of most people. Elder law helps people protect assets from nursing home costs and provides for disability planning, which means naming people who make decisions if you no longer can. Estate planning is about leaving assets to heirs with the least amount of court costs, legal fees and taxes, and leaving money to the people you want, the way you want, when you want.It helps to look at the pros and cons of wills versus trusts.A will is used in probate court if you die with assets in your name alone. It takes effect on death. The cons of wills are many. Probate proceedings waste time and money and may lead to will contests, where family members battle over the inheritance. Wills in probate court are public documents. Wills do not protect assets from nursing home costs and do not give disability protection. You run the risk of a costly, time-consuming guardianship proceeding where a judge appoints a legal guardian who controls your affairs. If you die with real estate in your name alone in another state, you will have two probates, one in New York and one in the other state.A revocable trust takes effect now when you create it and has many pros. A trust owns assets such as real estate, investments and bank accounts. A trust, like a will, states where assets go on death. Unlike wills, trusts avoid probate and save time and money and avoid will contests. You are the trustee (manager) and you have a right to income and principal of trust assets. Trusts are private documents. They avoid the risk of a guardianship proceeding on disability because the back-up trustee you choose will manage trust affairs. The big con of the revocable trust is no nursing home protection.The amazing irrevocable Medicaid Asset Protection Trust (MAPT) takes effect now and states who receives assets on death. The big pro of the MAPT is protecting assets from nursing home costs after the assets are in the trust for five years. One or two adult children are usually the trustees and you have a right to income only, not principal. However, you may gift principal to children and you may use principal to pay for real estate taxes, home maintenance and repairs and home insurance for the house in the trust. Only you decide which assets go into the trust. The MAPT avoids probate in New York and other states and avoids the risk of guardianship proceedings. Even though the trust is "irrevocable,” the trust can be revoked, provided all the people named in the trust agree to it.You may also create inheritance trusts for children. The pros are keeping assets in the family for children and grandchildren, not a son-in-law or daughter-in-law, and protecting the inheritance from children's divorces, lawsuits and creditors.Every plan should include a power of attorney and health-care proxy/living will to name people who will make legal, financial and health-care decisions upon incapacity.Bonnie Kraham is an attorney practicing elder law estate planning with Ettinger Law Firm, 75 Crystal Run Road, Middletown.
