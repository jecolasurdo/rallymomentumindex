For one thing, they're extremely convenient. However, there's also a safety factor to consider. Regardless of your destination and whether you travel for business or pleasure, it's much better to use credit cards than cash or traveler's checks. When looking for the right card, remember they're not all worth having. Why? Some of them charge a high foreign transaction fee.What's a Foreign Transaction Fee?Before going through the list of the best credit cards to take with you when traveling, it'd help to understand what a foreign transaction fee entails. In simple terms, a foreign transaction fee is a charge applied any time you use a card to purchase something in a foreign country. Although the amount varies depending on the financial institution, the fee is usually around 3%.While that might not sound like much, 3% can quickly add up if you take a lot of overseas trips and buy a decent amount of goods. It's especially high considering that you can find credit cards that don't have a foreign transaction fee. Instead of paying extra for the items you buy while abroad, you can use the money to enjoy your trip better.Identifying This Fee on Your Credit Card StatementThe foreign transaction fee is often carefully hidden in the terms and conditions of a credit card agreement. That means that some people have no idea they're charged for purchases made overseas. Before securing any new card, it's important to read everything, especially the fine print.The Two Parts of the Foreign Transaction FeeThere are two different parts of this fee. First is the amount you're charged by the company that issues the credit card. The second part is for the card's network. Typically, the network fee is 1%. However, on top of that, the issuing card company charges an additional fee, which is usually 2% to 3%.That means if you use a card that imposes a foreign transaction fee, you would ultimately pay on average a fee of 3% to 4%. Fortunately, some credit card companies absorb this fee, meaning you pay nothing. When traveling abroad, there are some specific things you need to know before you hand over your credit card, whether dining out, taking an excursion or buying a new outfit.Exchange RateFor purchases, you have the option of having the fee charged in US currency or the currency of the foreign country. You might think choosing US currency is the best choice, but that's not always true. You first need to know the current exchange rate. Depending on that, you could pay a lower fee by opting for the foreign country's currency.There's something very important to know about this. If the issuing company of your credit card only specifies fees in the local currency, it'll never impose this fee in US currency. The same rule applies if it specifies only US currency, just in reverse. The good news is that under the Truth in Lending Act, all credit card companies must disclose the terms and conditions for every fee charged, including the foreign transaction fee. Keep in mind that you have the legal right to choose which currency you want for this particular fee.What you have to do is look at your merchant receipt carefully before signing. Be sure the total amount charged appears in the foreign currency. If not, let the merchant know that you prefer to pay the fee in the country's currency as opposed to US currency. The same goes if you see two different currencies on your receipt. In that case, you'll need to let the merchant know the one you prefer.Foreign TransactionsFor many years, credit card companies charged cardholders this fee for anything purchased on foreign soil. Today, that's changed. As a prime example, if you buy something from a website owned and operated in China, the card issuer will likely hit you with a foreign transaction fee. The fee applies even if you paid for the item in US currency. The reason is that the transaction was still routed through a foreign financial institution, thereby making your purchase foreign.Credit Card RewardsWhen shopping around for a credit card, most people want one with an excellent rewards program. The question is whether foreign transaction fees go toward that. In fact, not only are you charged a foreign transaction fee, but it could go against your rewards. In other words, if you have a credit card with a 2% cashback reward but you end up paying 3% for the foreign transaction fee, you'll not have any reward to enjoy.Selecting the Best Credit CardRemember that credit card companies handle foreign transaction fees in different ways. Below you can see some of the variances.American Express – the Platinum Card, Delta Reserve, Gold Delta SkyMiles and Platinum Delta SkyMiles all have a 2.7% foreign transaction feeBank of America – the fee for the BankAmericard Travel Rewards ranges between 1% and 3%Barclays – the foreign transaction fee for the Princess Cruises Rewards Visa, AAdvantage Aviator Silver World Elite Mastercard, AAdvantage Aviator Red Mastercard, Barclaycard Arrival Plus World Elite Mastercard, Hawaiian Airlines Business Mastercard, and Barclays Arrival World Mastercard stands at between 1% and 3%Capital One – regardless of which Capital One card you have, you'll never have to pay this feeChase – holders of Chase Sapphire Preferred, Marriot Rewards Premier, Unlimited Mileage Plus cards (both), IHG Rewards Club Select Visa, Hyatt card, British Airways Visa Signature, and Southwest Airlines Rapid Rewards Premier pay a 3% foreign transaction feeCitibank – You'll also pay a 3% fee for the ThankYou Premier, Expedia Voyager, Citi Executive/AAdvantage World Elite Mastercard, Citi Prestige and Citi Hilton Honors ReserveDiscover – like Capital One, none of the Discover credit cards charge a foreign transaction feeUS Bank – the US Bank FlexPerks Travels Rewards card carries a 3% feeWells Fargo – the foreign transaction fee for the Wells Fargo Propel World American Express is also 3%What It All MeansIf you travel to different countries, you need to find out if your credit card issuer charges a foreign transaction fee, and if so, at what percentage. If you plan on getting a card, make sure to read the terms and conditions to find this information.Also, avoid the dynamic currency conversion service. That's when you allow merchants in other countries to choose whether you'll be charged in US currency or the currency of the country visiting. This is when you need to know the exchange rate so that you end up with a favorable transaction.Seek Financial AdviceEspecially if you travel abroad frequently, it won't hurt to talk to a reputable financial advisor. That individual can guide you to the best credit cards and answer any questions you might have about foreign transaction fees. Subscribe Sign up with your email address to receive news and updates.
