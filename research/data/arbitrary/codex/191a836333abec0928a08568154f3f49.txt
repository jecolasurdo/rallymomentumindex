Attribution: Volcano Hazards Program Office, Hawaiian Volcano Observatory Date published: June 22, 2020 Gases released from Yellowstone volcano provides clues to Earth's formation With oceans covering over 70% of Earth's surface and an atmosphere rich in volatile elements (carbon, nitrogen and oxygen), Earth has seemingly always provided the perfect environment for life to develop in the Solar System. But how and when did these volatiles arrive on the planet? It turns out, the answer lies buried thousands of kilometers deep below Yellowstone National Park.

Kīlauea was erupting 100 years ago, although it was certainly not quite as significant of an event on the world stage. This eruption a century ago produced the Mauna Iki ("little mountain”) lava shield on Kīlauea's Southwest Rift Zone.
