April: University of Bristol launches Coronavirus internship fund | News and features | University of Bristol News and features menu View all news University of Bristol launches coronavirus internship fund The new internship fund will help local SMEs navigate challenges presented by coronavirus Press release issued: 29 April 2020 Local small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs) in Bristol responding to the challenges of the coronavirus pandemic will be able to benefit from fully funded internships, thanks to a new scheme from the University of Bristol. The University's COVID-19 SME Internship Fund will help local SMEs in Bristol, including charities, social enterprises and start-ups dealing with the challenges brought about by the pandemic, while giving students valuable and meaningful work experience in a difficult economic climate. The fund, which totals over £100,000, will fund around 100 internships. Funding will be given to SMEs who can demonstrate their response to coronavirus-related challenges, how their core activity will benefit from an internship, and their intent to retain interns on a permanent basis. The scheme is open to current students and those who graduated from the University of Bristol in the last 12 months. Professor Guy Orpen, Deputy Vice Chancellor of New Campus Development at the University of Bristol, said: "I am delighted that the University is able to give our students these opportunities through the Covid-19 internship fund, and at the same time help local organisations to play their crucial roles in supporting Bristol and its people at this time of need." The scheme is open to SME's across Bristol, including those which are members of SETsquared Bristol. Paul Forster, Community Manager at SETsquared Bristol, said: "Small organisations are significantly more likely to be affected by the myriad of challenges presented by the global pandemic and lockdown. "SETsquared is really thrilled that the University of Bristol has announced the opportunity for SMEs to access fully-funded intern support from their students and graduates. This is the kind of backing our start-ups need to survive and thrive during these continually uncertain times." The University is also involved in over 60 pioneering research projects to urgently respond to the Coronavirus pandemic, including conducting COVID-19 vaccine trials.
