It is available to you if you have not reached your annual maximum loan limit combined with your Federal Direct Subsidized Stafford Loan eligibility. The interest rate for Federal Unsubsidized Stafford Loans is variable and changes every July 1st. The interest on an Unsubsidized Stafford Loan is your responsibility from the time the loan funds are sent to the university until it is paid in full. You can opt to allow the interest to accumulate; however, it will be added to the principal amount of the loan and increase the amount to be repaid. If possible, it is recommended that you contact the lender to make quarterly payments on the interest. There is also an origination fee that will be deducted before the loan proceeds are sent to the school. The origination fee is a processing fee assessed by the Department of Education. Repayment of the loan begins six months after you are no longer enrolled at least half time (six credits). Students must accept their Federal Direct Unsubsidized Stafford Loan online via their myUMBC account before it can be considered as payment toward the bill. For more information on how to accept the loans online, please visit our Loan Acceptance page.
