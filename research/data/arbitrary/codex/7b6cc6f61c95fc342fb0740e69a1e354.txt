With the UK lockdown measures still in full force, there a number of rules that must still be obeyed as the country continues in its fight against coronavirus. While staying inside and not being able to freely visit friends and family is frustrating, it's vital to reduce the spread of the disease so that we can return to normal life as soon and as safely as possible. It also helps to protect the NHS and save more lives. While Boris Johnson is expected to announce what the UK's plans are going forward tomorrow evening, (Sunday, May 10), the stringent measures remain in place this weekend. Here is the full list, issued by the National Police Chiefs' Council, of what you can and can't go shopping for over this Bank Holiday weekend. This advice applies to the UK's leading supermarkets including Asda, Tesco, M&S, Lidl, Morrisons, Sainsbury's, Aldi, B&Q and other shops this weekend. Shopping - What you can do: Buy several days' worth of food, including luxury items and alcohol Buy a small amount of a staple item or necessity (for example a newspaper, pet food, a loaf of bread or pint of milk) Collect surplus basic food items from a friend Buy tools and supplies to repair a fence panel damaged in bad weather If you're out on your weekly shop, you won't be stopped from browsing the "non-essential" aisles. The document adds that people have a reason to visit shops as long as they're open so it's not appropriate to stop them purchasing items considered to be "non-essentials" Read More Related Articles When is Prime Minister Boris Johnson's speech tomorrow and what can we expect?

It's important to remember before heading out that shops have their own rules which you need to follow, so check ahead of visiting. People are still encouraged to stay at home wherever possible during the coronavirus pandemic, and this includes not visiting friends and family who don't live in your home. If you need medical help for any reason, do not go to your GP surgery, pharmacy or hospital. If you have symptoms of coronavirus (high temperature or a new, continuous cough), use the 111 coronavirus service.LancsLiveFollow @LiveLancsMore OnLancashireCoronavirus What's OnallMost ReadMost RecentIn The NewsYou'll be able to see a rocket launch over the UK tonightSpaceX is launching another rocket from Florida carrying 60 Starlink satellitesDog walking ban at Lancaster's Gait Barrows National Nature Reserve for the next 50 yearsLancasterDog walking has been significantly restricted at Gait Barrows National Nature Reserve, near Lancaster, until 2070Where Peter Kay has spent the last two years away from the spotlightIn The News"He's shown once again what a real star he is."Historic deli market stall Redmans of Preston is up for salePrestonCity centre market stall Redmans of Preston is up for sale at a cool £95,000First look inside Haven parks as big changes are made for 2020What's On NewsThe holiday company has designed a new kind of holiday and overhauled its cleaning measures for 2020 LancashireThe Lancashire pubs up for sale and in need of a landlordSince the Prime Minister has announced that pubs can reopen on July 4 - you may want to take on a new ventureYou'll be able to see a rocket launch over the UK tonightIn The NewsSpaceX is launching another rocket from Florida carrying 60 Starlink satellitesHistoric deli market stall Redmans of Preston is up for salePrestonCity centre market stall Redmans of Preston is up for sale at a cool £95,000Mowgli Street Food cancels plans to open Preston restaurantPrestonMowgli Street Food had planned to open one of its Indian restaurants in Preston by the end of 2020Rossendale key worker's retail therapy cost her £60 'non-shoppers' fineRossendaleJacqueline Cumpstey spent nearly £300 at TK Maxx, Pets at Home, Home Bargains, Aldi, and Costa Coffee, but was then hit with a penalty noticeMost ReadMost RecentIn The NewsYou'll be able to see a rocket launch over the UK tonightSpaceX is launching another rocket from Florida carrying 60 Starlink satellitesGoFundMe pulls campaigns supporting man behind White Lives Matter stuntBurnleyAttempts to raise money for Jake Hepple and Megan Rambadt have been blocked by GoFundMe.Blackpool beach 'absolutely heaving' as temperatures soar above 30CBlackpoolBlackpool has been an area of particular concern for the infection rate and the last heatwave coincided with a sharp rise in both infections and deaths21-hour thunderstorm warning for Lancashire with hail and floods expectedWeatherA yellow weather warning has been set for the whole of LancashireTributes to Lancashire man who was held by his friends as he slipped awayFleetwood"It is with our hearts breaking that I write this tribute to my loving son Danny Wise.
