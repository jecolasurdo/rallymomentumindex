Search Candid gets you the information you need to do good. No matter what words are used to describe the police killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Tony McDade, and the murder of Ahmaud Arbery —"tragic,” "brutal,” "abhorrent,” "senseless”—they are not enough. In our homes, our workplaces, on the streets, and across the nation, people are scared, angry, grieving, and fed up. Candid stands with its Black staff and community to affirm that Black lives matter. Putting an end to systemic racism here and around the world is going to require nonprofits and foundations to step up like never before. Driven by Candid's core values, we are sharing continuously updated data and insight on race and policing, black male achievement, and racial equity. The only way for our sector to do more is to recognize where and how we have failed to do enough. We connect people who want to change the world with the resources they need to do it.
