(Nasdaq: IBKR) today announced the launch of its new Mutual Fund Marketplace, which offers availability to more than 25,000 mutual funds worldwide, including over 21,000 no load and 8,300 no transaction fee funds, from more than 290 fund families. The marketplace, which can be visited at ibkr.com/funds, is available to residents in over 200 countries and territories. "The Interactive Brokers Mutual Fund Marketplace is now the largest, single source of no-load mutual funds,” said Steve Sanders, EVP of marketing and product development. "Our marketplace also has lower costs, if not the lowest, on our massive inventory of mutual funds.” US clients have access to over 10,000 no load and load-waived funds and more than 4,300 no transaction fee funds with thousands more funds available for $14.95 per trade. Sanders also noted that, unlike many competitors, Interactive Brokers never charges a custody fee. Moreover, Interactive Brokers' Mutual Funds Marketplace includes products exclusively from outside companies. "Instead of pushing proprietary funds like Fidelity, Vanguard, Schwab and others do, Interactive Brokers is product neutral,” Sanders said. "We have a fantastic variety of fund families available in our agnostic marketplace.” To facilitate searching the massive marketplace, this week Interactive Brokers also introduced a Mutual Fund Search Tool to let clients and non-clients search products and sort by their country of residence, commission charged, fund type and fund family. In addition to mutual funds, Interactive Brokers clients can invest in stocks, options, futures, forex, bonds, and ETFs in 135 markets in 31 countries from a single integrated account. "Interactive Brokers has always focused on providing advanced technology, superior pricing and breadth of product worldwide. We have now built the largest no-load mutual funds marketplace to help investors enjoy increased access to global markets and greater diversification,” Sanders said. Residents of Australia, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, and Singapore will not have immediate access to the marketplace but should check back for availability. Access is not available to residents of sanctioned countries or territories.
