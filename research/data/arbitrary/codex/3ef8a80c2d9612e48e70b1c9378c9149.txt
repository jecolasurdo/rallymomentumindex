Multinationals and major exporters were hit by the strengthening pound, although banks and house builders held onto their gains. Updated at 12.05pm EST Facebook Twitter 11.33am EST 11:33 Construction was one of the bright spots in the UK economy in the last quarter, growing by 0.6%. But economic uncertainty threatens to pull the sector back again. Clive Docwra, Managing Director of construction consulting and design agency McBains, explains; "These latest figures reflect the uncertainty the sector is currently experiencing. They show an increase in new work over July to September, and in particular higher than expected increases in housing, commercial and industrial new work, but a slowdown in September itself. We expect this slowdown to continue over the next few months, especially given last month's confirmation of a further delay in Brexit. "Business and investors hate uncertainty, so the continuing saga of if and when the UK leaves the EU, plus the added unpredictability of the general election, means there will be a continued reluctance to commit funding to new projects. "We also need to see the major parties make strong policy commitments to boost the housebuilding programme, which is failing to deliver the number of homes required to meet the housing shortage.” Facebook Twitter 11.27am EST 11:27 Business owners from construction, manufacturing and TV have told us how they're coping through the slowdown: 'Uncertainty has been a nightmare': UK businesses on the economy Read more Facebook Twitter 10.18am EST 10:18 Shares in UK banks and housebuilders are rallying in London, as fears of a hung parliament recede a little. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group have both gained over 4%, as have building firms Persimmon and Barratt Development. Traders are calculating that Boris Johnson is strengthened by the Brexit Party's decision today not to challenge Conservative candidates in seats they won two years ago. Brexit party will not contest 317 Tory-won seats, Farage says Read more The pound is still holding its earlier gains, at six-month highs against the euro. But there's still several weeks of electioneering to come, so plenty of time for twists and turns. Seema Shah, chief strategist at Principal Global Investors, explains: "All eyes must now be on the Liberal Democrats. Will Farage's move incite a mirror image reaction from the Liberal Democrats, potentially stepping aside in order to increase Labour's chances and "take the fight” back to the Conservatives? As we approach the December 12 elections, investors should anticipate conflicting headlines, with currency moves perhaps disproportionate to the overall impact. Sterling is now at the whim of headline risk which, as Christmas approaches, waning market liquidity will exacerbate.” Facebook Twitter 10.07am EST 10:07 Back on GDP.... Chris Giles of the Financial Times has done some impressive number crunching, to prove a couple of important points. 1) The growth rate of the UK economy has been slowing, slowly but steadily, over the last seventy years. Chris Giles (@ChrisGiles_) ⚠️ SOME ECONOMIC CONTEXT ⚠️UK economic growth rates are historically low at the momentDecline has been reasonably consistent since WWII(which means you need to be careful with time comparisons)1/ pic.twitter.com/kWToev5cls November 11, 2019 2) The UK lagged behind major rivals in the post-war period, before closing the gap after joining the European Common Market.... Chris Giles (@ChrisGiles_) ADDENDUM - Some have asked for a reference for other countries - This is not altogether easy (here is a proxy such as the average of the US and France to reflect other G7 countries)- shows UK underperformance until *coughs* UK joins the EU. - Then better, now worse pic.twitter.com/F2N6AHaZm3 November 11, 2019 Updated at 10.08am EST Facebook Twitter 9.55am EST 09:55 Over in New York, stocks have opened lower. The Dow Jones industrial average has dropped by 139 points, or 0.5%, to 27,541. Trade war jitters are pulling Wall Street away from last Friday's record closing high. The broader S&P 500 index, and the tech-focused Nasdaq, are both down around 0.5%.

It also promised to make job offers to "as many employees as possible” across the group....

Photograph: Lindsey Parnaby/AFP via Getty Images Newsflash: British Steel has been saved from closure, after a Chinese industrial giant agreed to buy the company's assets. Jingye Steel is lifting British Steel out of liquidation, a move that could save thousands of jobs at sites including its blast furnace in Scunthorpe. Here's the official announcement from the Official Receiver: The Official Receiver and Special Managers from EY can confirm that a sales contract has been entered into with Jingye Steel (UK) Ltd and Jingye Steel (UK) Holding Ltd (together, Jingye), to acquire the business and assets of British Steel Limited (BSL), including the steelworks at Scunthorpe, UK mills and shares of FN Steel BV, British Steel France Rail SAS and TSP Engineering. The sale also includes the shares owned by BSL in Redcar Bulk Terminal Limited. Completion of the contract is conditional on a number of matters, including gaining the necessary regulatory approvals. The parties are working together to conclude a sale as soon as reasonably practicable. The business will continue to trade as normal during the period between exchange and completion. Support from employees, suppliers and customers since the liquidation has been a critical factor in achieving this outcome. This move, if approved, would end six months of uncertainty, since British Steel fell into liquidation in May.

This chart shows how growth on a per capita basis has been weak in recent quarter (data here). UK GDP per capita Photograph: ONS By my rough maths, GDP-per-capita only rose by 0.2% in the last quarter, slower than the headline increase of 0.3%. Officially, GDP-per-capita overtook its pre-crisis levels in 2015. But... Alfie Sterling of the New Economics Foundation has calculated that living standards are still below 2008 levels, once you adjust for consumer price inflation [rather than using the 'price deflator' used by the ONS to remove the impact of rising prices on GDP]. More here. Alfie Stirling (@alfie_stirling) The big question today is not whether GDP has grown over the passed few months. The real question is why, after adjusting for the actual costs faced by families, gross incomes per person are still lower today than they were in 2008.

But that's hardly impressive. Italy has been stagnating for years, Germany will probably tumble into recession on Thursday, and Japan's export-driven economy has been hurt by the US-China trade war. Facebook Twitter 8.24am EST 08:24 Javid: Brexit uncertainty isn't helping UK chancellor Sajid Javid today Photograph: Sky News UK chancellor Sajid Javid has insisted that the UK economy is in good shape, despite annual growth slowing to a nine-year low. But he's also cited ongoing uncertainty over Britain's departure from the EU. Javid told reporters: Over the last nine years since the Conservatives have been back in office we've seen nine consecutive years of growth. The chancellor cited "record high unemployment” and real wages growth, adding: These are all good signs of the fundamental strength of the economy. Q: But annual growth is now the weakest since 2010.... Javid blames "global factors”, pointing out that the IMF expect Britain to grow faster than Germany, Italy and Japan over the next couple of years. We are doing better than many of our competitors.... Here at home there are factors at play, and the number one issue is around uncertainty, around Brexit.
