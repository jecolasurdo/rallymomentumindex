King Salman on Tuesday ordered that the implementation of final judgments and orders in such cases be suspended. He also ordered the immediate, temporary release of prisoners already serving time for debt-related convictions, the Saudi Press Agency reported. In addition, the king suspended all orders and judgments granting an estranged parent child-visitation rights. The orders will remain in force until the authorities announce that the pandemic no longer poses a threat to public health. Walid Al-Samaani, the justice minister and president of the Supreme Judicial Council, thanked King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the decisions. He said that they are part of the efforts being made by the government to ensure the safety of everyone in the Kingdom, and reflect the fact that public health is the main priority at this time. The orders were implemented immediately. Legal and prison authorities have been notified and told to take all necessary action. All those affected by the suspension of parental visitation rights were notified by text message.

Hamidaddin's role at the ministry is to facilitate opening Saudi Arabia to international tourism through strategic oversight of large-scale marketing and communications campaigns. The Saudi Ministry of Tourism recently launched the "Saudi Summer” initiative in an effort to resume and promote domestic tourism activities in the Kingdom. During a virtual press conference on Wednesday, Hamidaddin said 81 percent of Saudis are unwilling to travel outside the Kingdom this summer, according to an extensive survey on tourism. The ministry is working to empower local businesses in the industry and help them overcome the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak. "The pandemic has left people feeling stifled. Our role is to turn that feeling into something that could help them relax. People just want to breathe right now,” he said. Previously, Hamidaddin was chief commercial officer at King Abdullah Economic City (KAEC) beginning in 2012. His responsibilities included the company's marketing, corporate communications, and sustainable development groups. He also led the city's customer experience, investment promotions, and activation, and strengthened KAEC's strategic partnership with key media outlets to help promote it as a residential and business destination. Hamidaddin was chief of marketing and competitiveness initiatives at the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority (SAGIA) between 2005 and 2012. He was responsible for SAGIA's marketing strategy and received several international awards for advertising campaigns. Hamidaddin also led the Global Competitiveness Forum, founded by SAGIA, for five years. Its goal is to raise the competitiveness of the Kingdom and gather global economic, social and intellectual leaders to debate and discuss diverse issues. He also worked for Procter & Gamble as an assistant corporate marketing manager between 1999 and 2001 and was responsible for all consumer promotions of the company's brands and for managing service partners and strategic alliances. Hamidaddin holds a bachelor of science degree in industrial management from the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
