Failure to receive a bill will not relieve obligation of penalty and interest for late payment, so it is important to make sure your correct address and information are on file: Personal Property Taxes: Anyone having a vehicle or equipment garaged in and registered to the city on January 1, 2010 should have provided a Personal Property Return to the Commissioner of Revenue's office by May 1, to avoid a non-file fee. For questions about assessment of taxes you may contact the Commissioner of Revenue's office at 220-6150. Real Estate Taxes: If your mortgage company pays your taxes you should not receive a bill. If you and not a mortgage company are responsible for payment of your taxes, please be sure the Assessor's office has the correct mailing address. For Assessment information you may contact the Assessors office at 220-6185. For questions about payment of taxes please contact the Finance Department at 220-6180 or by email.
