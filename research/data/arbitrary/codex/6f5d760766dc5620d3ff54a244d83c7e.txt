There are more demands on our time, energy and resources than ever before. Additionally, the need to provide compassion, warmth and reassurance to our patients has been complicated by the competing need to social distance ourselves. On a personal level, these various challenges have come into harsh focus recently. As an oncologist specializing in lung cancer, I treat patients who are not only facing a deadly disease but also must contend with rampant stigma. This unfair assessment by society—which basically amounts to the mentality that somehow lung cancer patients "deserve” their illness—takes a real and tangible toll on these patients. In the past few days alone, I have spoken with several patients who expressed real worry that, due to their lung cancer diagnosis, their lives would be seen as less important. I did my utmost to reassure them that that was untrue. Their lives do matter. They are important. And they will continue to receive the care they both need and deserve. But it was still incredibly difficult to hear. The need to navigate additional considerations when trying to provide timely and high-quality treatment has become more than evident. One evening in my office, I found myself lying down on the floor, reviewing every case that I have already discussed several times and talking myself down that the decision was the correct about postponing treatment, CT scans and having follow-ups by telemedicine. And on that subject, phone visits, video calls and telemedicine with new patients has been particularly hard for me. The inability to provide human touch to one who is facing a fatal diagnosis like lung cancer has been devastating for patients and for the entirety of the care team. Hugging is something that has always helped me cope, and I can say that I am certainly missing that now. Also, having to trust a doctor that you only met or seen via a screen or by phone is no easy task. You are trusting a doctor whom you have not met in person with your life. The weight of this is overwhelming, and the sense of isolation grows for patients. In just a few short weeks, the coronavirus has altered almost every aspect of society, adding immense stress to the population and new personal and vocational hurdles that must be overcome. But for all of the recent difficulties, I remain grateful to be an oncologist and committed to providing excellent and essential care to the lung cancer community.
