Cumbria Business Growth Hub has drawn up a business survival toolkit and a business continuity checklist, which can be downloaded from its website. It also has a team of advisers, available under its Catalyst programme, who can work with businesses one-to-one to help them access grants and other support. Suzanne Caldwell, deputy chief executive of Cumbria Chamber of Commerce, the lead partner in the Growth Hub, said: "The flooding Cumbria experienced this week wasn't anything like as severe as the floods of 2005, 2009 and 2015. "But some places have been hit, particularly Appleby. "We've drawn on the experiences of those earlier floods, updated our advice and made it available on our website. "I'd particularly recommend that flood-affected businesses download the toolkit, which we drew up in partnership with the accountant Lamont Pridmore. "If they need further help, they can call us – that's what the Growth Hub is here for.” Those businesses eligible for the Catalyst scheme, which is funded by Cumbria Local Enterprise Partnership, can get a free one-to-one business health check with a Growth Hub adviser who will produce a report with recommendations. They also get access to free business workshops. A business and economy recovery group has been set up in the wake of Storm Ciara, to co-ordinate support for businesses. Partners include Cumbria Chamber of Commerce, Cumbria County Council, Eden District Council, Cumbria Local Enterprise Partnership and the Department for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy. Flood-hit businesses in need of support can call Cumbria Business Growth Hub on 0844 257 84 50. 0 comment Most read Commented Loading...
