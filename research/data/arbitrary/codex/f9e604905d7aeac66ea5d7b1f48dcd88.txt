By mid-April, there were more than 2 million confirmed cases worldwide, nearly 140,000 deaths, and all indications pointing to a rapid increase.Here is some of the latest scientific information published on the origins, effects and behaviour of the virus that causes COVID-19.We apologize, but this video has failed to load.Try refreshing your browser, ortap here to see other videos from our team.What science is telling us about COVID-19, from deadly spikes to brain seizures Back to videoThis undated electron microscope image made available by the U.S. National Institutes of Health in February 2020 shows the novel coronavirus. The Canadian Press/THE ASSOCIATED PRESSWhat makes this coronavirus so dangerous?There are multiple types of coronaviruses that affect humans and animals. Human coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960s. The most common ones result in nothing more serious than a cold or minor respiratory tract infection.Some variations, however, can be deadly:MERS-CoV, the version that causes Middle East Respiratory Syndrome; first detected in Saudi Arabia in 2012; 2,494 confirmed cases; 858 dead.SARS-CoV, which causes severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS; first detected in Asia in 2002; more than 8,000 infected; 774 dead.SARS-CoV-2, which causes the novel coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19; first detected in December; final death count yet to be tallied.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedAll three are coronaviruses that infect animals and evolved into a new human coronavirus.Note the spikes that adorn the outer surface of the virus, which impart the look of a corona. ALISSA ECKERT/Centers for Disease Control andWhy does it spread with such deadly efficiency? Like the coronaviruses that cause the common cold, the virus that causes COVID-19 has spiky projections on its surface and uses "spike proteins” to infect host cells and multiply by the millions. Because it is a new type of virus, the body does not immediately recognize it, and may not send antibodies to attack it right away.As explained in Nature magazine, the spike protein in coronaviruses bind to the human cell membrane. In the case of COVID-19, the virus's spike protein is activated by a host-cell enzyme called furin, which is found in the lungs, but also in the liver and small intestines. That means the novel coronavirus might be able to attack multiple organs. It also means it could be spread more easily between humans, although scientists caution this theory is unproven thus far. Other researchers have found the spike protein binds to a receptor on human cells — known as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) — at least 10 times more tightly than does the spike protein in the SARS virus. Scientists are testing to see whether drugs can be used to block the receptors in the human cells, making it harder for the novel coronavirus to enter.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedWas it a bat or a pangolin?It is referred to as a "novel coronavirus” because it is a variation of coronavirus that has not been previously identified. The World Health Organization gave the disease it causes an official name — "coronavirus disease 2019,” or COVID-19 — on Feb. 11. It is believed to have started in bats, where the virus circulates naturally, then was possibly passed to a pangolin, an endangered anteater, before being passed to humans at a market that sells live and dead animals in China.Who lives and who dies?According to a World Health Organization-China Joint Mission report based on the outbreak in China:AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continued80 per cent with verified COVID-19 had mild to moderate symptoms that lasted two weeks;13.8 per cent had severe disease with serious breathing problems and lung infiltration lasting 3 to 6 weeks;6.1 per cent were critical, experiencing respiratory failure, septic shock and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure;Fatality rates were roughly 2 per cent, but the actual number might be lower because of undiagnosed cases who survived.Chief Public Health Officer Dr. Theresa Tam said in late March that in Canada:6 to 7 per cent of cases require hospitalization;3 per cent are critically ill;1 per cent die.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedScientists have identified 69 possible drugs and experimental compounds that may be effective in treating the novel coronavirus. Darwin Brandis/Getty Images/iStockphotoAre there any treatments to ease symptoms?There are no treatments — or a cure — yet.A team of researchers have identified 69 possible drugs and experimental compounds that may be effective in treating the coronavirus. Scientists have begun testing the compounds against live coronavirus grown in laboratories.The World Health Organization launched a global mega-trial of the four most promising or talked about treatments, inviting researchers and hospitals worldwide to submit results, Science magazine reported.Remdesivir: developed to combat Ebola, it was not effective for its intended purpose, but has been shown in test tube and animal studies to inhibit the coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS. No large trials have been completed.Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine: anti-malarial drugs that have been used for decades, but have never been found to combat viruses in humans. Results so far from COVID-19 patients have been "murky,” Science magazine reported. The WHO scientific panel had originally decided to leave the two drugs out of the trial, but changed its mind because the drugs "received significant attention.” An Arizona man died after ingesting a fish-tank cleaner that contained chloroquine phosphate after U.S. President Donald Trump cited the drug as a potential cure, saying he thought it would be a "game-changer.” Despite the warnings of health professionals that the drugs can have serious negative side-effects, including liver failure and hearing loss, if taken without a prescription, Trump continues to tout the alleged effectiveness of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine while dismissing the risks in his daily press briefings.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedLopinavir/ritonavir: a combination antiviral drug used to treat HIV infections.

It allowed scientists worldwide to start research.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedStill, a working vaccine that can be issued globallyis not expected in less than a year because of the time needed to test it properly on humans.Is loss of smell a bad sign?Possibly. As cases of COVID-19 spread worldwide, there has been an increase in the number of infected people reporting a loss of smell, and sometimes taste, who later tested positive. The American Academy of Otolaryngology – Head and Neck Surgery issued a statement proposing the loss of smell (anosmia) be added to the list of screening tools for COVID-19 infection. A study from South Korea found 30 per cent of some 2,000 patients who tested positive for the coronavirus reported experiencing anosmia. Many who suffered loss of smell had a mild form of coronavirus, which made them less likely to know they had the disease and more likely to transmit it. Most victims got their sense of smell back after a few days or weeks. Other experts, however, caution the link between loss of smell and the disease is not proven, and note that a loss of smell often accompanies any form of congestion.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedA study published in the journal Pediatrics looking at more than 2,000 ill children found a small percentage can become very sick. SEBASTIAN CASTANEDA/REUTERSIs it true children can become seriously ill?Early reports and studies out of China gave the impression children are mostly immune to the coronavirus, with those under 10 accounting for only 1 per cent of 44,000 cases studied. The same was found for children age 10 to 19. But a subsequent study published in the journal Pediatrics looking at more than 2,000 ill children in China found a small percentage can become very sick. "Young children, particularly infants, were vulnerable to infection,” the authors found. The most vulnerable are those under one year of age. One boy, age 14, died.It's unclear why most children's cases were less severe than adults. The scientists hypothesized children may have had less contact with sick patients, and were less sensitive to the SARS-CoV-2 virus because many experience respiratory infections in winter and may have higher levels of antibody against the virus than adults. The still-developing immune system of children may also respond to pathogens differently than adults.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedIs the virus mutating a lot?A bit of hope from the Washington Post: The coronavirus is not mutating quickly as it circulates through the human population, suggesting it is less likely to become more or less dangerous as it spreads and could make it easier for scientists trying to develop a long-lasting vaccine. Scientists are studying more than 1,000 different samples of the virus, and only four to 10 genetic differences have been detected between strains infecting people in the U.S. and the original virus that spread in Wuhan."That's a relatively small number of mutations for having passed through a large number of people,” said Peter Thielen, a molecular geneticist at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory. "At this point, the mutation rate of the virus would suggest that the vaccine developed for SARS-CoV-2 would be a single vaccine (like that used for measles or chicken pox), rather than a new vaccine every year like the flu vaccine. ... That's great news.”AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedHow is COVID-19 changing science?More heartening news: the pandemic has spurred a historic concerted effort by the worldwide scientific community. "Never before, researchers say, have so many experts in so many countries focused simultaneously on a single topic and with such urgency,” the New York Times reported. Researchers are publishing their findings immediately online, with more than 200 clinical trials already launched. The closest comparable example of global scientific sharing could be during height of the AIDS epidemic in the 1990s, but today's technology means information can be shared infinitely faster and more efficiently than ever before.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedSince the sequencing of the first virus sample, from an early patient, scientists have completed nearly two dozen more, said Andrew Rambaut of the University of Edinburgh, an expert on viral evolution, STAT News reported. That pace is "unprecedented and completely unbelievable,” said Andersen, who worked on sequencing the Ebola genome during the 2014 outbreak. "It's just insane.”Normal protocols of keeping exclusive scientific research secret to preserve grants and prestige are evaporating in the face of a plague that is hitting the homes of all scientists, not just far-flung African nations.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedDoes ibuprofen make COVID-19 worse?On March 14, the French ministry of health sent out a government directive counselling against the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDS, like ibuprofen, of which Advil and Motrin are the best-known brands, to reduce fever. The warning of "serious adverse events” was based on early case reports out of China that patients with higher rates of expression of the enzyme known as ACE2 might have higher risk of coronavirus infection. Anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen can cause ACE2 to rise. The warning went viral on the Internet, often linked to stories, many false, of young people who were supposedly taking huge doses of ibuprofen and died of COVID-19. Others said it could kick the virus into pneumonia, or make it 10 times worse. The problem is that the French reports were not backed up by any proven, peer-reviewed studies and it's unclear if there is any truth to them. The World Health Organization (and later others) responded by tweeting that it "does not recommend against the use of ibuprofen,” and is not aware of reports of any negative effects. Dr. Mahyar Etminan, a drug safety expert with the University of British Columbia, said patients with mild to moderate fevers should use acetaminophen like Tylenol and Tempra first, which give relief from pain and fever. If the fever worsens and becomes a high fever, Advil "can be used along with acetaminophen and then discontinued as soon as a patient's temperature returns to normal.”AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedAn overview in Wired magazine showed how stories of this type are spreading rapidly in a panicked, hyperconnected world.

Numerous studies indicate having too much alcohol could reduce the body's immune system's ability to ward off infectious diseases, reports Global Health Now, a publication of the John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. While the occasional glass of wine or beer is fine, sustained, heavy drinking, particularly of hard alcohol, can dampen immune responses or increase susceptibility to pneumonia, which COVID-19 causes. An evening of binge drinking can lessen immunity for days to come. Alcohol can also damage immune cells in the lungs and epithelial cells lining the lungs' surface, where COVID-19 can attack.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedThe article offers a glimmer of happier news, noting that some studies have found drinking moderate amounts of wine or beer may not hamper immunity and could offer cardiovascular benefits.

WCS/HandoutCats, dogs, tigers and COVID-19: What do animals show us?So far, there have been reports ofcats, dogs and now a Bronx Zoo tiger that have contracted mild cases of COVID-19. In each instance, it's believed the animals contracted the disease from humans. Nadia, the 4-year old Malaysian tiger (as well as six of its tiger and lion compatriots, who were not tested but had mild coughs), are the first animals known to show signs of the disease. The WHO says it has not had any reports of pets transmitting it to owners, and the Centres for Disease Control says it has not received any reports of pets getting sick with COVID-19 in the U.S. Pets do carry other forms of coronavirus that can make them sick, like canine and feline coronaviruses, but they do not seem to infect people.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedThere is no evidence the virus that causes COVID-19 can spread to people from the skin or fur of pets. Testing animals for COVID-19 is not recommended. However, since animals can spread other diseases to people, it's always a good idea to practise healthy habits around pets and other animals, such as washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene. And humans who have tested positive are advised to keep away from their pets.Strokes, seizures, brain impairments: Are these side-effects?A small subset of COVID-19 patients have exhibited neurological problems and brain impairments, including strokes, seizures or generalized confusion. Cases reported in the New York Times include a 74-year-old man in Boca Raton, Fla., who lost the ability to speak and appeared to be suffering a seizure, flailing his arms and legs. An airline worker in her late 50s in Detroit complained of headaches and became less responsive — brain scans showed abnormal swelling in the brain, and areas where brain cells had died. Doctors diagnosed acute necrotizing encephalopathy, a rare complication of influenza and other viral infections. The pattern was consistent with a viral inflammation of the brain.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continued"This may indicate the virus can invade the brain directly in rare circumstances,” Dr. Elissa Fory told the Times. Doctors globally have reported patients who come in appearing dazed or confused. Experts emphasized most COVID-19 patients appear normal neurologically, and it's too early to establish a definite link to neurological impairment. Low oxygen levels and increased carbon dioxide caused by the disease can also have an impact on brain functioning and lead to confusion and lethargy.An early study with limitations indicates blood types may play a role in infection rates. Sean Gallup/Getty ImagesDoes blood type play a role in immunity?A study by Chinese researchers on 2,173 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan and Shenzhen found that blood group A was associated with a higher risk for acquiring COVID-19 as compared with non-A blood groups, and blood group O was associated with a lower risk. The study has not yet been peer-reviewed, and was posted on the MedRxiv pre-print server, where scientists share research globally before they're formally published. The authors note, however, that it's an early study with limitations, and "it would be premature to use this study to guide clinical practice at this time.”AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedIn a breakdown of the study, Sciencealert.comfound the differences between those who were found to be immune based on blood type were relatively small, and likely won't change anything about how people should be trying to limit the spread of the virus. But the review also notes blood types can change the way we are affected by certain viruses, because the ABO blood group categorization is based on which particular molecules or 'antigens' lie on the surface of blood cells. Some viruses require certain antigens to latch on to, thus can be more easily transmitted to certain blood types. This appears to be the case with the Norovirus stomach flu that sometimes afflicts hapless cruise ship passengers, but often leaves roughly one-third uninfected.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedWhat's the link between air pollution and death rates?A new study out of Harvard University analyzing 3,080 counties across the United States has found coronavirus victims living in areas with higher levels of air pollution are more likely to die from the disease than those living in cleaner areas.The study, reviewed in the New York Times, found that if Manhattan had lowered its particulate matter by a single unit over the past 20 years, the borough would have seen 248 fewer COVID-19 deaths as of April 4. Dr. John R. Balmes of the American Lung Association said the findings were particularly important for poor neighbourhoods and communities of colour, which tend to be exposed to higher levels of air pollution. Breathing in fine particulate matter, which comes mostly from cars and refineries, inflames and damages the lining of the lungs over time, making the body less able to fight off respiratory infections.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedOther studies have indicated cigarette smokers are at increased risk of suffering more severe symptoms, or death, from COVID-19,with 12.4 per cent of smokers dying or requiring intensive hospital care, as compared to 4.7 per cent of non-smokers.Montreal Heart Institute pairs wth NYU: What's promising about colchicine?The Montreal Heart Institute Research Centre announced on April 7 it is teaming up with NYU Grossman School of Medicine in New York City in its COVID-19 clinical study to determine if the anti-inflammatory drug colchicine could help to prevent the "major inflammatory storm” present in adults suffering severe complications. The COLCORONA study, instituted by the Montreal Heart Institute on March 23 by Dr. Jean-Claude Tardif, will involve recruiting 6,000 participants who will be followed for 30 days. Participants must have tested positive, be over 40, not have been hospitalized and be willing to take the drug or a placebo for 30 days. Those interested can call 1-877-536-6837 or visit colcorona.org for more information. The study is funded by the Quebec government and supported by Pharmascience and CGI. Scientists hope the drug's powerful anti-inflammatory properties will help reduce the virulent lung inflammation seen in COVID-19 patients.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedrbruemmer@postmedia.comMore On This TopicA timeline of the novel coronavirus in QuebecWHO-China joint mission report on COVID-19Note to readers:We know the speed and volume of coronavirus-related news is overwhelming and a little frightening.
