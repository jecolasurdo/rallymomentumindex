Register Now > Save to My ICO February 29, 2020 Coronavirus Information for Ophthalmologists It is critical that eye health professionals understand the risks associated with the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak. The virus appears to be spread via respiratory droplets. Patients may be infectious to others even before they experience symptoms of infection. Reports suggest the virus can cause conjunctivitis, so it is possible that it is transmitted by aerosol contact with conjunctiva. It is recommended that you protect your mouth, nose (e.g., an N-95 mask), or eyes (e.g., goggles or shield). Affected patients frequently present to eye clinics or emergency departments. This increases the likelihood ophthalmologists may be the first providers to evaluate patients possibly infected with COVID-19. For more information, please visit the Coronavirus pages on the following sites: World Health Organization American Academy of Ophthalmology The Lancet Save to My ICO March 6, 2020 Help Create Greater Glaucoma Awareness, World Glaucoma Week, 8–14 March 2020 World Glaucoma Week, taking place 8–14 March, is a joint initiative between the World Glaucoma Association and the World Glaucoma Patient Association. More details about World Glaucoma Week and many examples of glaucoma awareness activities around the world can be found on the World Glaucoma Week website, www.worldglaucomaweek.org and www.wga.one. Save to My ICO March 20, 2020 COVID-19 Alert The COVID-19 pandemic presents a major challenge to health care providers around the globe. While the world is asked to stay home with social distancing recommendations, our ophthalmology colleagues continue to provide urgent care to patients to prevent vision loss. The close proximity as part of eye examinations and treatment puts the ophthalmologist and their entire team at particularly high risk of contracting COVID-19. The virus may cause conjunctivitis, so it is possible that it is transmitted by aerosol contact with conjunctiva. The protection of health care providers and patients is critical due to the rapid spread of coronavirus. The ICO stands with the recommendations regarding public health safety related to COVID-19 issued by the World Health Organization. Additional resources are available from the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the Canadian Ophthalmological Society, and the French Ophthalmology Society. As our colleagues work tirelessly in the days and weeks ahead, we acknowledge their courage and the efforts of all those providing eye care on the front lines during these unprecedented times. Save to My ICO March 27, 2020 ICO Global COVID-19 Resource Center Welcome to the ICO Global COVID-19 Resource Center. Here you will find COVID-19 related guidelines, resources, and information provided by ICO Member societies from around the world. We are facing extraordinarily challenging times due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the world is asked to stay home with social distancing recommendations, ophthalmology colleagues and their teams continue to provide urgent care to our patients. Ophthalmologists and eye health teams work in close proximity to their patients as part of the eye examinations and treatment, and they are at particularly high risk of being exposed to the virus and contracting COVID-19. Their protection and that of patients is critical due to the rapid spread of coronavirus. The ICO stands with the recommendations regarding public health safety related to COVID-19 issued by the World Health Organization. To help protect eye health providers and in response to the growing needs of our global eye health community for information, we have launched this ICO Global COVID-19 Resource Center. Thank you to all those who have already submitted resources to share. Please email your society guidelines, statements, and recommendations to COVID19resources@icoph.org.

Save to My ICO April 2, 2020 The David and Molly Pyott Foundation Scholarships in Ophthalmology – Application Deadline 1 June 2020 The University of Edinburgh will award 12 scholarships for successful applicants to their Master of Surgery (ChM) in Clinical Ophthalmology programme, thanks to the very generous support of The David and Molly Pyott Foundation. Trainees/residents/registrars in Ophthalmology and qualified ophthalmologists (generalists and specialists) from Africa, Central and South Asia, Caribbean Islands, Pacific Islands, Central and Latin America who are accepted for admission to the online ChM programme commencing in September 2020 are eligible to apply for the scholarship award which will cover all tuition fees as well as internet access and a laptop. Scholarship applications close on 1st June 2020. Full online application instructions can be found here. The part-time, online 2-year ChM programme is offered by the University of Edinburgh in partnership with the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Further course information is available online, along with an introductory video by Professor Baljean Dhillon, Professor of Clinical Ophthalmology at the University of Edinburgh, and video testimonials by ChM graduates. The ChM is one of a number of Edinburgh Surgery Online Masters programmes in the surgical specialities at the University. The ChM is designed to support ophthalmology trainees in the United Kingdom and internationally by providing advanced training for those preparing for the fellowship examinations of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh (RCSEd), International Council of Ophthalmology and the Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) and those approaching consultancy. The David and Molly Pyott Foundation has been funding this highly successful programme of scholarships in partnership with the University since 2016 which has seen trainee and qualified ophthalmologists (generalists and specialists) from a range of Low and Middle Income countries being educated and trained at Masters level, online, as part of their journey to becoming consultant/specialist ophthalmologists. The online, part time nature of the ChM means that students can study in their home countries without having to take time out of practice or training, whilst continuing to deliver critical care in regions with ophthalmic workforce capacity issues. Thanks to a very generous additional donation by the Foundation recently, the number of scholarships available in 2020 has doubled. The purpose of the six new scholarships is to support trainees/residents/registrars in ophthalmology and qualified ophthalmologists with leadership potential who are nationals of and resident/working in member countries* of the College of Ophthalmology of Eastern, Central and Southern Africa (*as defined on COECSA website as of 1st March 2020). The aim is to fund 30 trainee ophthalmologists over the next 5 five years to undertake the ChM to increase the provision of quality eye care and facilitate the further growth of Ophthalmology services in the region. The University of Edinburgh is working in partnership with the Foundation and COECSA colleagues to facilitate education and training opportunities for the next generation of leaders in ophthalmology.
