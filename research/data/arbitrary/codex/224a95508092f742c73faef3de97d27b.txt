Living at Home as a College Student during Coronavirus March 26, 2020 As UNC students shift to living at their permanent addresses due to COVID-19, stress is likely high. You're bringing home all the challenges you faced on campus – keeping up with your academics, staying social, thinking about summer plans – but with the addition of a global pandemic, navigating most interactions online, and living with your family. When Home Isn't Safe: COVID-19 and Interpersonal Violence March 25, 2020 This is an unprecedented time for all of us. Uncertainty is rampant and public health officials are all recommending we engage in social distancing. For some folks, social distancing might not look much different than their normal weekend routine: pajamas all day, netflix, and lots of chill time. But for some of the most vulnerable, social distancing can be challenging and even dangerous. Distance Learning Tips for UNC Students during COVID-19 March 23, 2020 Online learning for UNC students starts today. You are not alone if you're feeling anxious or ambivalent or annoyed or any other feeling that starts with "a” (or any other letter) about this shift. This is a new context for most of us. We believe you can be successful learning online. We also understand that not all students have access to a computer or high-speed internet. Here are some tips that might help you with your academic life over the next few months: Managing Mental Health during Coronavirus March 13, 2020 People like certainty. We want to know what is happening and when it's happening. We are hard wired to notice things that feel threatening to us. When situations feel uncertain or we generally feel unsafe, it is normal to feel stressed. That reaction is there to protect us, and there are strategies you can use to help yourself.
