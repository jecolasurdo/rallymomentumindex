Mr Kim became the first North Korean leader since the 1950-53 Korean War to set foot in South Korea, stepping over a concrete curb marking the border at the truce village of Panmunjom to shake hands with his counterpart. Scenes of Mr Moon and Mr Kim joking and walking together marked a striking contrast to last year's barrage of North Korean missile tests and its largest ever nuclear test that led to sweeping international sanctions and fears of a fresh conflict on the Korean peninsula. The dramatic meeting comes weeks before Mr Kim is due to meet US President Donald Trump to discuss denuclearising the Korean peninsula. "We are at a starting line today, where a new history of peace, prosperity and inter-Korean relations is being written," Mr Kim said before the two Korean leaders and top aides began talks. The two leaders discussed denuclearisation and permanent peace on the Korean peninsula during their morning session, and are expected to sign a joint declaration after they reconvene Friday afternoon, a South Korean official told reporters. During their private meeting, Mr Kim told Mr Moon he came to the summit to end the history of conflict and joked he was sorry for waking Mr Moon up with his early morning missile tests, a South Korean official said. Mr Kim told Mr Moon he would be willing to visit the presidential Blue House in Seoul, invited Mr Moon to Pyongyang, and said he wanted to meet "more often" in the future, the official said. Just days before the summit, Mr Kim said North Korea would suspend nuclear and long-range missile tests and dismantle its only known nuclear test site. But there is widespread scepticism about whether Mr Kim is ready to abandon the nuclear arsenal his country has defended and developed for decades as what it says is a necessary deterrent against US invasion. Two earlier summits between the leaders of North and South Korea, in Pyongyang in 2000 and 2007, failed to halt the North's weapons programmes or improve relations in a lasting way.

First across the line After closed-door talks lasting more than 90 minutes, Mr Kim was driven back to the North side in a black limousine flanked by guards who ran alongside. Crossing the border, the vehicle had to drive across a lawn, as there is not a road linking the two sides at that spot. Following lunch, the two leaders are scheduled to plant a memorial tree before resuming their meeting, finishing the evening with dinner and a film. The leaders' wives are expected to join them for dinner, the South said. Earlier, Mr Moon greeted Mr Kim at the military demarcation line where the men smiled and shook hands. In an unplanned move, Mr Kim invited Mr Moon to step briefly across into North Korea, before the two leaders crossed back into South Korea holding hands. "I was excited to meet at this historic place and it is really moving that you came all the way to the demarcation line to greet me in person," Mr Kim said. The two were handed flowers by two South Korean children, residents of a village situated in the demilitarised zone, and met on a red carpet by a South Korean honour guard in historical costumes playing traditional music. Mr Kim wore his trademark black Mao suit, while the rest of the North Korean delegation appeared in military uniforms or Western attire. "A new history starts now. An age of peace, from the starting point of history," Mr Kim wrote in Korean in a guest book in the South's Peace House before talks began. Minutes before Mr Kim entered Peace House, a North Korean security team conducted a sweep for explosives and listening devices, and sprayed what appeared to be disinfectant in the air, on the chairs, and on the guest book.

The White House also said it looks forward to continuing discussions with South Korea in preparation for the planned meeting of Mr Trump and Mr Kim in the coming weeks. Just months ago, Mr Trump and Mr Kim were trading threats and insults as the North made rapid advances in pursuit of nuclear-armed missiles capable of hitting the United States. Mr Moon travelled to the meeting in a large motorcade, stopping briefly to greet dozens of summit supporters waving South Korean flags near the presidential Blue House in Seoul. Hundreds of demonstrators were seen gathering in downtown Seoul from early morning to protest or support the summit. Impoverished North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because the Korean War ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The United States stations 28,500 troops in South Korea as a legacy of the Cold War conflict, which pitted the South, the United States and United Nations forces against the communist North, backed by China and Russia. Mr Kim and Mr Trump are expected to meet in late May or June, with Mr Trump saying on Thursday he was considering several possible dates and venues. The latest Korean summit has particular significance not least because of its venue: the Demilitarised Zone, a 260km long, 4km wide strip of land created in the 1953 armistice to serve as a buffer between the South and North. - Reuters Share this Share on Twitter Share on Facebook Share via email Share on Reddit Share on Linked In Copyright © 2018, Radio New Zealand Subscribe to RNZ's Daily Newsletter View latest newsletter Related Stories South Korea turns off loudspeaker broadcasts into North 23 Apr 2018 South Korea has stopped broadcasting propaganda via loudspeakers along the border with North Korea, ahead of top-level talks later this week.
