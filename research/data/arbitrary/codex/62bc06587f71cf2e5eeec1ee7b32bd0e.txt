Read ArticleClinical Data & ResearchSummary of the History of Clinical Research/Studies on HIFUIn 1994, Drs. Michael Marberger and Stephan Madersbacher performed the first human prostate cancer study at the University of Vienna in Austria using the Sonablate 200. 29 prostates were treated before performing a radical prostatectomy in order to see if the energy delivered was enough to destroy the targeted tissue. The study found that treatment could be performed safely and be repeated if necessary.In the United States, research on HIFU began in the 1950s at Indiana University in Indianapolis, IN.In 1999, Dr. Toyaki Uchida began treating patients in Japan using the Sonablate® 200, the first generation of the Sonablate device.In Europe, the Sonablate 500 received its approval for use in 2001.In 2004, US HIFU was founded and began placing Sonablate devices in countries throughout the world, including Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, the Caribbean, India and ArgentinaIn Canada, Health Canada approved the Sonablate 500 in 2005.In the United States, the FDA approved HIFU for prostate treatment in October, 2015The following list of publications provides information on clinical results and research on Sonablate HIFU for prostate cancer.

Inoue, Yoji, Keisuke Goto, Tetsutaro Hayashi, and Mutsuo Hayashi. International Journal of Urology 18, no. 5 (2011): 358–363.|Conclusions: High-intensity focused ultrasound therapy appears to be minimally invasive, efficacious and safe for patients with localized prostate cancer, particularly those with low- and intermediate-risk cancer.Focal Therapy for Localized Prostate Cancer: A Phase I/II Trial.
