Police said the protest was peaceful, but a separate group of people became aggressive afterward and the escalation was in response. Tear gas was first deployed near the Nike store at Main Ave and Wall St, then at others areas across downtown. Looters first broke into the store and the SWAT team was seen going in behind them. Several businesses were broken into or looted throughout the night. Police announced over a speaker that people in Riverfront Park were "instigating a riot” and threatened to arrest those who chose to stay. Police issued a Public Safety Alert shortly after asking people to avoid downtown Spokane, specifically in the area of Riverfront Park. Spokane Mayor Nadine Woodward issued a curfew Sunday night that expired at 5 a.m. Monday. It applied to blocks from Division to Maple, and Fifth to Boone. 3 of 3. In order to disperse people from downtown & give everyone a chance to cool down, Spokane Mayor Nadine Woodward has enacted a curfew now until 5 a.m. Monday. The order applies to Division to Maple & Fifth to Boone. — City of Spokane (@SpokaneCity) June 1, 2020 DISCLAIMER: Some videos may contain explicit language and unsettling images.
