Print Hundreds gathered to participate in a protest march against racial inequality and police brutality on Thursday at Mile Square Park in Fountain Valley.The "Black Lives Matter” demonstration followed a wave of protests that have swept the nation since George Floyd, an unarmed black man, died from suffocation after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.A memorial service was held for Floyd on Thursday. Among the speakers was the Rev. Al Sharpton, who likened Floyd's death to the history of black people in America. He said the reason black people could not be who they dreamed of being was because "you had your knee on our neck.”Impassioned speech was found in Fountain Valley too, where the demonstrators walked the perimeter of the park with an abundance of chants and signage.

"You are threatened by me, and there's power within me. That's what that says, and so that's why I'm out here. That power that they're threatened by, I need to use it to speak out for those people out there that feel like they can't speak out for themselves, for those people out there who lost their lives because nobody stood up and fought for them as they were losing their lives for 8 minutes and 46 seconds as the life was choked from them.”Albert added that she believes police brutality needs to be criminalized, and in her view, it took too long for the officers involved in the death of Floyd to face charges.

On Wednesday, the charges against Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, were upgraded to include second-degree murder. Three other officers at the scene were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.Social gathering had been discouraged during the coronavirus pandemic, but some at the protest felt that more are being made aware of the issues of police brutality and racism as they watch the protests from home.

"It's a horrible, horrible thing that institutional segregation has been perpetual in this country, 400 years of this, and we're finally at a point where there was a breaking point, and people are actually listening to this and starting to make some changes."I think it's so important for everybody to say something, to participate, to evolve themselves because it will never change unless we make an effort.”The crowd included youthful faces, and members of other minority groups said they were also keen to rally behind the African American community.

It starts with them.” TimesOC O.C. teenagers organize a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest in Garden Grove that attracts thousands TimesOC O.C. teenagers organize a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest in Garden Grove that attracts thousands Meep Shows and Garden Grove High School's Black Student Union led a crowd of approximately 4,000 people down the streets of Garden Grove in a march against police brutality.
