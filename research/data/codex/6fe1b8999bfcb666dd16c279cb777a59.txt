Here are the players who protested in Week 2:Philadelphia Eagles: Safety Malcolm Jenkins, cornerback Ron Brooks and defensive end Steven Means stood side by side, each with one arm raised in the air during the national anthem prior to the Monday Night Football game between the Eagles and Bears. -- Tim McManusSan Francisco 49ers: Kaepernick and safety Eric Reid again knelt for the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Panthers. Safety Antoine Bethea and linebacker Eli Harold again held up their right fists during the anthem, with cornerback Rashard Robinson and safety Jaquiski Tartt joining them. Bethea and Harold raised their fists last week, but this is the first time Robinson and Tartt joined in protest. -- Nick WagonerColin Kaepernick and Eric Reid continued their protest before Sunday's game in Carolina.

It was the group's second straight week kneeling. Linebacker Jelani Jenkins, who joined the group last week in Seattle, did not do so this week. Earlier this week, Foster said the main purpose of their demonstration is to create a healthy dialogue on systemic racial issues such as education, the prison system and police brutality toward minorities. In turn, Foster added, productive conversations could help lead to change. "It's just so easy to hate," he said. "If you're proclaiming to be a true American, freedom runs in our bloodlines, right? It's supposed to. If somebody is telling you they don't feel like they're free, why wouldn't you listen to them?" -- James WalkerKansas City Chiefs: No players linked arms for the Chiefs during the national anthem in Houston on Sunday. Every player was standing along the sideline except Marcus Peters, who was standing behind his teammates, though he didn't raise a fist this week like he did in Week 1. Peters said last week he was "100 percent" behind Kaepernick. "I'm black. I love being black, and I'm supporting Colin as far as what he's doing as far as raising awareness of the justice system," he said. -- Adam TeicherTennessee Titans: Cornerback Jason McCourty and defensive tackle Jurrell Casey kissed their hands and raised their fists after the national anthem before the game in Detroit. Both players raised their fists during the anthem in Week 1. Earlier this week, Casey explained what the gesture meant to him: "A small symbol showing we are looking for equal opportunity in this world, and we just need justice for all the things that's going on around here," he said. -- Paul KuharskyDenver Broncos: Linebacker Brandon Marshall took a knee during the national anthem Sunday before the game against the Colts in Denver. It is the second consecutive game Marshall has taken a knee during the anthem. This week he said he had "no timeline" about when he would stand during the anthem. He did meet with Denver police chief Robert C. White this past Tuesday and has agreed to go through a shoot-don't-shoot training simulator that officers use in training, as well as go on a ride along with Denver police officers. -- Jeff LegwoldLos Angeles Rams: Defensive end Robert Quinn held up his right fist once again before the Rams' matchup with the Seahawks. Wide receiver Kenny Britt, who joined him in doing that on Monday Night Football in Week 1, did not. Here's what Quinn said last week: "Long story short, [coach Jeff] Fisher asked us to stand. So I respect him enough to do that," he said. "But at least to show awareness, raise my fist, show support out there that you have support throughout the league. I didn't want to try to distract the team; just want to have my right of freedom." -- Alden GonzalezSan Diego Chargers: Offensive linemen Joe Barksdale and Chris Hairston held up their fists during the national anthem before the Chargers' matchup against visiting Jacksonville. "It's just a solidarity thing,” Barksdale said after the game. "Chris has two kids. I have a daughter that's on the way. You never want to bury your kids. It's just our way of saying we still stand for the national anthem. We're happy to be in the country and all that kind of thing. But at the same time, things need to change.” -- Eric D. WilliamsGreen Bay Packers: For the second straight week, several Packers players helped hold the flag during the national anthem. Randall Cobb, T.J. Lang, Bryan Bulaga, Mason Crosby, David Bakhtiari and Jared Cook were among them. -- Rob Demovsky FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmail
