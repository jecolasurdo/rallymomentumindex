"We are not going to be quiet. We are not going to apologize for who we are. We are going to stand up for what's right and we believe that everybody has a right at life,” said Erin Sarvis, Cookout at the Capitol organizer. Hundreds of people of all ages, all races and all backgrounds came together for hours on the steps of the Capitol to support the Black Lives Matter movement. The crowd erupted in applause as speakers passionately promised they wouldn't back down until there's change.

Those in attendance said the energy feels different this year. "The biggest surprise to me that I've seen, especially on social media, is all the non-colored people coming out and having something to say and they're just so supportive of it, and I just think that's really what's going to get this stuff over with. It's going to end it,” said Daniel Santana. "I think it's great that people are still supporting the cause. Especially today, in 2020,” said Kaiya Crosby. Signs protesters held demanded action, singled out silence and supported love and equality for all. The protest also had an extra element: food fresh off the charcoal grill. "I figured if we feed the people while they're yelling, give them some energy and soul, then they'll be able to keep on yelling,” said Sarvis.
