"We see things getting worse — we see the wealth gap getting worse, we see the housing gap getting worse, and when it comes to police killings and murders and homicides, that's definitely getting worse."An organizer of Saturday's protest and march, Andre Friedman, said he knows the family of Thurman Blevins, the man who died in a Minneapolis police shooting in June. Friedman said the state fair is a good place to bring a message to many different people."We chose the fair because it is where our counterparts, our citizens, our residents are today — and we want to raise awareness among those residents that we have an issue with our police departments in both St. Paul and Minneapolis," he said.This was the fourth year in a row the group protested at the fair.The St. Paul Police Department assisted with traffic control during the protest to ensure marchers and drivers stayed safe.Before you go...MPR News is dedicated to bringing you clarity in coverage from our reporters across the state, stories that connect us, and conversations that provide perspectives when we need it most.
