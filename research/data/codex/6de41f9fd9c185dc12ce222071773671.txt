According to police, troopers followed the vehicle, which they said was traveling recklessly on I-95 north. They said Soulemane hit two state police cruisers with his car and another vehicle before being boxed in by police. Police said a stun gun was initially used on Soulemane, but it did not work, and that a weapon was shown before Trooper Brian North fired his gun multiple times. Troopers said a weapon was shown before trooper Brian North fired his gun multiple times. Soulemane's family said the teen battled with mental illness and said while he may have committed a crime, he did not deserve to die. They intend to file a wrongful death lawsuit against the State of Connecticut, Connecticut State Police, the City of West Haven and the West Haven Police department for $10 million in damages. The Middlesex State's Attorney is investigating the shooting, and a preliminary report ruled Soulemane's death a homicide. Black Lives Matter New Haven says Mubarak's "name must be heard around the state...we cannot let this be forgotten.” People protesting Friday said too many young black men have been shot by police officers.
