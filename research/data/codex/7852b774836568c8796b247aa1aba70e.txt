Terence Crutcher was killed Sept. 16 in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Keith Lamont Scott was killed Sept. 20 in Charlotte, North Carolina, the latter of which sparked violent protests in the city.Members of several different Athens organizations participated in the demonstration, including the Unitarian Universalist Fellowship of Athens, the Economic Justice Coalition, Athens for Everyone, the Athens branch of the NAACP and the Athens Anti-Discrimination Movement. Some of the organizations took the opportunity to promote the establishment of an Athens Civil Rights Committee, referring to the proposed Athens-Clarke County ordinance aimed at combating discrimination at downtown bars. Over the course of the hour-long vigil, several people spoke to the crowd, including Mokah Jasmine Johson, co-founder of the Athens Anti-Discrimination Movement. Johnson, along with her husband Knowa Johnson, have been working with the community officials in an effort to improve the lives of African-Americans in Athens. The two organized the anti-discrimination march in January that brought the issue of discrimination in downtown Athens to the forefront."We get together with commissioners,” Knowa Johnson said. "We try to get together with the mayor. We try to work together on legislation. We try to have a voice in the situation.”Mokah Johnson spoke of her stepson who was shot and killed a few years ago, and about the injustice they are trying to fight.

That is a lie," she said. "I am a black woman with a black son. As a matter of fact, my stepson got shot and killed a few years ago. They still didn't find his killer. That resonates in my heart.” The speakers were not the only voices heard at the event, however.Dante Tercha, an African-American man, stood at the Arch holding a sign with the words "Make America Great Again" written on it. During the event, Tercha talked to people on the edges of the crowd, arguing against the points he believed the protestors were trying to make, and arguing against other unfairness in the system.Though the conversations between Tercha and others became argumentative at times, the discussions remained civil, which was how Tercha said he hoped the conversations would be."Yes, I started off a little abrasive and aggressive in order to gain attention, only because that's the tactic I learned from the left,” he said. "Once I had enough peaceful and sincere people in line to hear my message, I want to simply make clear that black lives matter. All lives matter."Tercha said he wanted clarification when it came to how the Black Lives Matter movement portrayed law enforcement.

"All I'm saying is I don't want the Black Lives Matter movement to depict all police as bloodthirsty, rogue police officers when that is simply not true.”After the speakers concluded, the protesters came together to light candles in a show of solidarity for the cause.
