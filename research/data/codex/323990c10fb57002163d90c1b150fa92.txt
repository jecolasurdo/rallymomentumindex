Skyler Frazer / Journal Inquirer Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save MANCHESTER — Before leading a crowd of more than 150 people in chants and rally cries against police brutality and racial injustice Monday afternoon, resident Keren Alexis Prescott exchanged elbow bumps with local police, assuring each other that the event would be safe and meaningful for everyone involved.Prescott organized a grassroots rally Monday at the corner of Main and Center streets to speak against racial injustice.Prescott and the country's attention has been on the May 25 death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. After a social media video last week showed Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin pressing his knee against Floyd's neck until he died, protests and rallies have broken out across the country. Chauvin has since been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, but Prescott and others are calling for discipline of the other three officers who were at the scene during Floyd's death."I am sick and tired of being sick and tired,” Prescott said. Standing at the corner of Main and Center Streets, Manchester resident Keren Alexis Prescott speaks to fellow protesters about police brutality and racial injustice in the country at Monday's rally. Skyler Frazer / Journal Inquirer Prescott said she was happy she met with Manchester police before the rally started, though she admitted that as a black woman she sometimes feels nervous in such situations."My daughter needed to see that,” Prescott said of the friendly encounter. "It is what she needed to see after seeing so much chaos on TV.”As the rally kicked off, Prescott laid out some house rules for the "family-friendly” rally and acknowledged the several children and young people in the audience. Emotions were high, but Prescott said the group was "against violence, period.”And for roughly two hours, well over 150 people made their voices heard at the site across from Manchester Town Hall. Prescott led chants like "no justice, no peace,” and "black lives matter.” While Prescott said she agrees with the idea that all lives matter, those who say that as a counter to black lives matter need to understand why there is current frustration, she said."I have multiple sclerosis, and for multiple sclerosis the color that represents us is orange. How dare I go to a cancer walk and pull people over and say, 'I know your mother died of breast cancer, but do you know how many people are dying of multiple sclerosis?'” Prescott said. "It would be very insensitive of me.”Several others spoke about racial injustice during the afternoon, some from Manchester, others from East Hartford or as far away as New London. Manchester Police Capt. Anthony Palombizio takes a knee in solidarity with the crowd at Monday's rally. Skyler Frazer / Journal Inquirer At 2:18 p.m., members of the group went down on one knee for several minutes to represent how Floyd died, and some police officers took a knee in solidarity with the crowd.Manchester Mayor Jay Moran attended the rally and spoke, along with Lt. Gov. Susan Bysiewicz and Board of Education Chairman Darryl Thames. Eighth Utilities District President John Topping and town directors Yolanda Castillo and Brian Marois were also in the crowd supporting the peaceful rally."Every person should be valued; it doesn't matter what they look like or where they came from,” Moran said to the crowd.A march was scheduled down the road later in the afternoon, and several protesters made their way over following the rally.Prescott said she'll be at the corner of Center and Main Street at 2 p.m. every day she can and encouraged people to join her."We're always told that our voice matters, and it does, but it doesn't matter if you're yelling at your TV like my mom does — they don't listen,” Prescott said.
