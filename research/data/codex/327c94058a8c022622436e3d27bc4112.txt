Six Baltimore police officers are facing criminal charges connected to his death.As light rain fell, Des Moines demonstrators followed the opening chant with another of "hey hey, ho ho, racist cops have got to go."Gray's death in police custody is another in a string of deaths, including the deaths last year of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner in New York City, leading minority communities to lose trust in police, said Kaija Carter, an 18-year-old Des Moines Area Community College student who helped organize the event."Communities across the nation are mourning the death of Freddie Gray, along with countless other black bodies and brown bodies who have been beaten, choked and shot to death by law enforcement," Carter said. "Policeman are not being held accountable for their actions because they are protected by a system that puts their lives before ours and justifies the murders they commit."While Des Moines has not recently seen a controversial death like Gray's, there are more subtle ways that Des Moines police treat blacks that are just as corrosive for the community, Carter said. An often-cited 2013 American Civil Liberties Union study found that blacks in Iowa are more than eight times as likely to be arrested for marijuana possession than whites, though both groups use the drug at the same rate, she said.State Rep. Ako Abdul-Samad told demonstrators that Gray's death should be motivation for people to elect city council members and other representatives who will emphasize better police accountability. Samad, who represents much of Des Moines' urban core, has supported legislation that would require all police officers and sheriff's deputies to wear body cameras."One of the ways to address and make black lives matter is that we have the law that supports that," he said. "If the law doesn't support it, then again we'll have rallies."Des Moines Police Maj. Stephen Waymire visited the event briefly while making a stop at nearby Smokey Row Coffee. Waymire commended the protesters, noting the event was in stark contrast to rioting and burning seen in Baltimore after Gray's death."It was very well-organized and peaceful," he said. "This is what makes Des Moines a great place."Other than Waymire, the rally attracted no attention from police. Several people honked car horns and shouted in support as they drove by.Des Moines police Sgt. Jason Halifax disagreed with protesters' claims that police who commit brutal acts aren't always held accountable. The Des Moines department has a "demonstrated a history of policing our own," he said. Most recently, a federal jury in March convicted former officer Colin Boone of using unreasonable force when he kicked a man in the head during a 2013 traffic stop.Former Des Moines Police Chief Judy Bradshaw fired Boone as the result of an internal investigation months before he was indicted by a federal grand jury late in 2013. The investigation was prompted by fellow officers who came forward with concerns about Boone's behavior the night of the arrest, and after his conviction the U.S. Department of Justice thanked several officers who testified against him at trial.Molly Feldman, a DMACC criminal justice student who hopes to become a police officer, attended the rally holding a sign reading #BlueLivesMatter. Feldman, 26, said believes police officers equally become victims of profiling when actions of "a few bad officers" blemish the entire profession.Feldman was inspired Monday by the death of 25-year-old New York City police officer Brian Moore, who was shot in the head on Saturday during a stop in Queens."I wanted to stand there for all the good officers," she said. " Nobody is standing out, protesting (Moore's) death and the fact that he was shot in the face and a year younger than me."Staff Directory Corrections Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Public Notices Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My AccountSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS Feeds MilestonesJob Network Cars.com Des Moines Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2020 www.desmoinesregister.com.
