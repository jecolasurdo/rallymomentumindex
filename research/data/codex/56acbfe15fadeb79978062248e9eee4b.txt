Crowe II TROY – Carrying signs and chanting "Justice for Edson” and "Prosecute Killer Cops,” about 60 people demonstrated outside the Polish American Club Thursday night as the City Council met inside. The crowd was fired up by the recent public release of the city police department internal affairs report that criticized Sgt. Randall French for lying about why he fatally shoot Edson Thevenin during an April 2016 DWI traffic stop. The department never acted on the report's findings and instead the city commissioned a second not-yet-released report to refute the determination of the internal affairs probe. Alfonso Rodriguez led the crowd with a bullhorn in yelling out the various phrases as they stood outside the club at 507 First St. He said they wanted to see French fired by the city and the creation of a civilian review board that has teeth to oversee the city police department. Justice for Dahmeek, a local group organized after Dahmeek McDonald was wounded during a police shooting in the North Central neighborhood, was one of the driving forces behind the Thursday turnout. McDonald was wanted as a parole absconder when he was wounded during a traffic stop in Aug. 2017. Both shootings involved white officers and black suspects. Pastor Tre' Staton and Thevenin's mother, Gertha Depas, attended the demonstration. The Thevenin family has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city in U.S. District Court in Albany. It was in federal court that the city was ordered to turnover the French internal affairs report and where it was made public. McDonald also has filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city. Staton said the Thevenin family wants to see the case end but that the city is dragging it on. Staton said this is a fight for justice. "I respect everyone's right to protest and express their feelings and opinions. I also believe deeply in due process and look forward to this matter progressing through the courts," Mayor Patrick Madden said Thursday in a text message from the council meeting. The city also was criticized for the failure to have its Police Objective Review Committee functioning. The committee, which is supposed to have eight members appointed by the mayor, is the only city panel that is charged with reviewing the police department's internal affairs investigations. The committee last met in 2014.

He said his administration has been building consensus among different groups to support the reestablishment of the committee. The mayor said he has discussed the review board with the city's pastoral alliance of African American ministers, the city's new police command and the U.S. Justice Department. Renee Powell, president of the NAACP Troy chapter, said the committee must have a diverse membership that reflects the city's population. NAACP members and leaders joined the demonstration. Powell said the police department needs to rebuild its relationships with the community. The City Council's Law Committee is expected when it meets next month to discuss the internal affairs report that found French forced Thevenin's vehicle off the road and lied about the circumstances leading up to the shooting. In addition, the council members are expected to take up the subsequent report commissioned by the city that refuted the internal affairs findings. The second report has not been made public.
