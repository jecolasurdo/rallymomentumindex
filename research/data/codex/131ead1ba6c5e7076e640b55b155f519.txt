Thank you, as always, to those who took the time to reach out on Twitter and elsewhere. Here are the key developments from the last few hours: The Minneapolis city council pledged to defund city's police department. A veto-proof majority of the Minneapolis city council announced its intent to dismantle the city's police department and invest in community-led public safety, a move that would mark the first concrete victory in the mounting nationwide movement to defund law enforcement agencies in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. My colleague Sam Levin explains here what defunding the police might mean. New York City's mayor pledged to cut police department funding. New York City mayor Bill de Blasio on Sunday pledged to cut the police department's funding, shifting the savings to social services. In a tweet from the City of New York shared by the mayor, de Blasio outlines policing reforms, including a plan to "Shift funding from NYPD to to Youth and Social Services.” New York City's curfew was lifted. De Blasio also lifted a citywide 8pm curfew that drew extensive criticism for intensifying tensions between protesters and police – including numerous accounts of brutality against participants in demonstrations following the killing of George Floyd. A protester was shot in Seattle. A man drove a car into a demonstration and shot a protester in Seattle, Washington. It's unclear exactly what happened, but police said officers have a man in custody who drove a car into a crowd at 11th avenue and Pine street, and that officers recovered a gun. Video footage shows a man driving a black sedan into the gathering, and catches a loud bang before the man exits the vehicle, gun in hand. The man then walks into the crowd with the gun at his side. US attorney general said troops were a last resort. The US attorney general, William Barr, appeared on CBS's Face the Nation, where he was asked about the decision to have military troops on standby to respond to US citizens exercising their right to protest. "I think our position was common, which was that they should only be deployed ... as a last resort and that we didn't think we would need them. I think everyone was on the same page,” he said. Reports emerged last week that Donald Trump wanted 10,000 active troops to be ordered on to the streets of America to police the protests. Barr denied that accusation on Sunday. "The president never asked or suggested that we needed to deploy regular troops at that point,” he said. Thousands marched in Phoenix, Arizona, where protesters rally not just for George Floyd, but for Dion Johnson, a 28-year-old black man who was shot and killed by an Arizona Department of Public Safety officer.

Updated at 2.41am EDT Facebook Twitter 2.37am EDT 02:37 Meanwhile British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted on Sunday that the anti-racism protests in the UK were "subverted by thuggery”, after some protestors clashed with police in London: Boris Johnson #StayAlert (@BorisJohnson) People have a right to protest peacefully & while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police. These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery - and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve. Those responsible will be held to account. June 7, 2020 Facebook Twitter 2.32am EDT 02:32 Fans of the popular South Korean boy band BTS matched its $1 million donation to Black Lives Matter (BLM) in support of US protests against police brutality, an organisation that runs fundraisers for the fans said on Monday. The K-pop group's music label, Big Hit Entertainment, on Sunday told Reuters that BTS had donated $1 million to BLM in early June. The seven-member BTS wrote on its Twitter account on Thursday that they are against racism and violence with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter. "We stand against racial discrimination. We condemn violence. You, I and we all have the right to be respected. We will stand together.”The hashtag went viral among the group's fans and started another wave of donations with the hashtag #MatchAMillion.The movement encouraged BTS' fan base, known as ARMY, an acronym for Adorable Representative MC for Youth, to match the group's $1 million donation.The campaign had raised $1,007,518 as of Monday at 9:47 a.m. (0047 GMT), and will continue indefinitely, the organisers said. Facebook Twitter 2.09am EDT 02:09 US soccer federation considers repealing kneeling ban The US Soccer Federation is considering repealing its ban on players kneeling during the national anthem, ESPN reports: At the urging of USSF president Cindy Parlow Cone, the board will meet via conference call Tuesday to discuss the policy, sources said. The board probably will take a formal vote Friday. If the board votes to repeal the policy, it would take effect immediately, but it would still have to be voted on at the next annual general meeting, scheduled to take place in February or March. At that point, the National Council could either back the repeal or vote to keep the policy in place. Updated at 2.20am EDT Facebook Twitter 2.04am EDT 02:04 "Never in my lifetime has the case of such visible injustice moved white and black people, moved them as human beings,” poet and novelist Ben Okri writes for the Guardian: There have been protests all across America. But there have been huge protests in Britain, in Spain, in Nigeria, in fact all across the world. Why has the killing of George Floyd struck such a profound chord in us? Maybe it was that phrase: "I can't breathe.” The consonance of the phrase with the very root of our pandemic fears is uncanny. The phrase linked the coronavirus with the ubiquitous and implacable nature of institutional racism. "I can't breathe” – yet people were prepared to risk being afflicted with coronavirus just so they could express their protest at the chokehold killing of a black man. ... What happened to George Floyd isn't new. "I can't breathe” was uttered by another police victim, Eric Garner, less than a decade ago. But now there has been a crossover protest on a universal scale. This time is different. This time it is epochal. Language taps into primal fears. 'I can't breathe': why George Floyd's words reverberate around the world | Ben Okri Read more Facebook Twitter 1.58am EDT 01:58 As #BlackLivesMatter and George Floyd protests in the US inspire people around the world to demonstrate against racism, statues commemorating figures known for their brutality against black people are coming under fire. On Sunday, as my colleague Martin Farrer writes, "protesters in Bristol in the UK toppled a statue to the 17th century slave trader Edward Colston that has long been the focus of anger in the city. Demonstrators gathered at the memorial on Sunday before attaching ropes to it, hauling it down and then pushing it into the docks. The historian David Olusoga compared it to the toppling of the statue of Saddam Hussein in Iraq but home secretary, Priti Patel, called the incident 'disgraceful'.” Meanwhile in Brussels, Belgium, Euronews journalist Jack Parrock filmed as a group of men climbed onto a statue of King Leopold II and waved the Congolese flag, while chanting "murderer” and "reparations”. Some estimates put the toll of people who died between 1885 and 1908 in the Congo Free State – an area that today lies within the Democratic Republic of Congo – which was privately owned and controlled by the Belgian king, as high as ten million.

The message was added days after the mayor of Washington, DC., had the words Black Lives Matter painted on a street leading to the White House amid days of demonstrations in the nations capital and all over the country in response to George Floyd's death in Minneapolis.Floyd was born in North Carolina, where memorial service for family was held on Saturday.

The street leads to Confederate monuments on State Capitol grounds, which have been spotlighted as offensive during protests, according to the AP. The painting was applied Sunday morning when a city engineer met the artists and brought barricades to block off the street."We did it. And it's wonderful. And we feel really good about it. Our voices are being heard, but it's not enough,” Driver said. Facebook Twitter 1.32am EDT 01:32 Get in touch on Twitter @helenrsullivan. Facebook Twitter 1.31am EDT 01:31 Meanwhile, Trump has "liked” a tweet about the HBO show 'Insecure' on Twitter. It is unclear whether this was on purpose, but the unlikely pairing (Insecure is a show about a young black woman living in LA) is causing a stir online. meena hart duerson (@meenasaurus) Huh? pic.twitter.com/ewh8RkT7Nx June 8, 2020 Facebook Twitter 1.23am EDT 01:23 US President Donald Trump has tweeted about statements made by NFL commissioner Roger Goodell on Friday last week regarding racism at the NFL. Goodell, speaking in a video, said the league made mistakes in not listening to players in a video on Friday denouncing racism in the United States amid widespread protests over police brutality against black people. "We, the National Football League, admit we were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier and encourage all to speak out and peacefully protest,” he said. "We, the National Football League, believe black lives matter.” Trump tweeted around an hour ago that it might be possible that Goodell is "intimating that it would now be OK for the players to KNEEL or not to stand, for the National Anthem, thereby disrespecting our Country & out flag.” Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) Could it be even remotely possible that in Roger Goodell's rather interesting statement of peace and reconciliation, he was intimating that it would now be O.K. for the players to KNEEL, or not to stand, for the National Anthem, thereby disrespecting our Country & our Flag? June 8, 2020 Goodell did not mention Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback whose decision to kneel during the national anthem during a preseason game in August 2016 kick-started the protest movement. He did not mention the US flag or national anthem, either. More on Goodell's statements here: 'We were wrong': Goodell admits NFL should have listened to players on protests Read more Updated at 1.39am EDT Facebook Twitter 1.15am EDT 01:15 Sam Levin Here is the full report on Minneapolis lawmakers vowing to disband the police department: Speaking at a community rally on Sunday, a veto-proof majority of councilmembers declared their intent to "dismantle” and "abolish” the embattled police agency responsible for George Floyd's death – and build an alternative model of community-led safety. The decision is a direct response to the massive protests that have taken over American cities in the last two weeks, and is a major victory for abolitionist activists who have long fought to disband police and prisons. "In Minneapolis and in cities across the US, it is clear that our system of policing is not keeping our communities safe,” said Lisa Bender, the Minneapolis city council president, at the event. Nine councilmembers announced their support and represent a supermajority on the twelve-person council, meaning the mayor, who earlier this weekend opposed disbanding the department, cannot override them. The remaining three councilmembers are broadly supportive of the effort as well, but weren't ready to sign on, activists said. While the mayor has oversight over the police, the city council has authority over the budget and policy, and could work to dismantle the department through cuts and ordinances.
