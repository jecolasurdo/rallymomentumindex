(Bill Schneider - varsitypix.com)Some Tamalpais High School football players kneeled in protest during the national anthem at Marin Catholic in Kentfield on Saturday.Show Caption of ExpandBy Danny Schmidt | Marin Independent JournalPUBLISHED: September 27, 2016 at 7:40 p.m. | UPDATED: July 19, 2018 at 12:28 p.m.A group of six Tamalpais High School football players knelt during the national anthem before Saturday's game against Marin Catholic, becoming the first Marin athletes to join 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's protest of police brutality and social injustice against blacks. Tre'Chaun Berkley, Oscar Corona, Pedro Mira, Braxton Mitchell, Leonjae Silas and Jordan Smith each took a knee two weeks after San Francisco's Mission High football team made headlines by kneeling in unison during the anthem prior to its game against Redwood High School in Larkspur. The contingent of Tam's Red-tailed Hawks plans to continue kneeling each week. "We feel we need to do this until there's some justice,” said Silas, 17, a black resident of Marin City. Tam coach Jon Black, who was unaware the group knelt until after the game, said he was happy the players felt comfortable expressing their feelings. He called a team meeting Monday to discuss his players' thoughts on the First Amendment and issues surrounding the protest. "The coaches are very supportive,” Silas said. "They just wanted to know why. Our whole team is completely supporting us. I think some more will do it, because we're a family.” Tamalpais Union High School District Superintendent David Yoshihara said, "We support our students' right to the First Amendment.” District policy, approved by the Board of Trustees, "encourages activities that instill pride in our country,” and states that "the district respects the legal right of individuals not to participate in the salute to the flag for personal reasons.” The policy supports free expression as long as there is no physical danger, violence, abusive or insulting language, obscene or slanderous expressions. Berkley said the group's plan was solidified last week when two black men were killed by police officers: Keith Scott in Charlotte, North Carolina, and Terence Crutcher in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The officer who shot the unarmed Crutcher, Betty Jo Shelby, was indicted on a charge of first-degree manslaughter. According to a police report, the officer said she thought Crutcher, who was not responding to her while walking away with his hands up, was going to kill her. "That absolutely made me want to do it,” Berkley said. "That confirmed it. It's getting out of hand.” Berkley, 18, who is black, said he's been discriminated against and harassed by police officers countless times, recalling two instances near his Marin City home during his sophomore year. The first came as he exited the bus coming home from practice. He was quickly surrounded by a few patrol cars, and officers asked to search his football bag, saying he fit the description of a suspect they sought, Berkley said. One officer drew his gun as others surrounded Berkley, he said, then put the weapon down upon discovering Berkley was clean. Later that season, he and a friend were walking outside when two white officers stopped the pair and put them in handcuffs for walking in the street, rather than on the sidewalk, Berkley said. "I didn't know all my rights at the time,” Berkley said. "I said they could check me because I didn't have anything on me.” Berkley was not arrested or detained on either occasion. "I don't think it's ever going to stop, to be honest,” he said. "The main reason I (kneel) is because I know everything that's going on could happen to me.” A spokesman for the Marin County Sheriff's Office, which provides law enforcement in the Marin City area, could not immediately be reached for comment.
