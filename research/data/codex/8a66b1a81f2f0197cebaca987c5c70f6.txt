The march was organized by the Black Queer and Intersectional Collective, with the goal of raising awareness about the challenges black trans women face. The streets were open by 9:30 p.m. with everything ending peacefully outside Stonewall Columbus, where the group's voices got louder. Dozens chanted in the streets with a message Saturday night. "No justice, no peace, our bodies are on the streets.” According to the Black Queer and Intersectional Collective, this year alone, 20 trans women across the country have been killed. "This is in direct response to the widespread violence that has killed a lot of our black trans sisters this year and years prior,” said Dkeama Alexis, co-founder and co-organizer of Black Queer and Intersectional Collective. "Malaysia Booker. She was 23.” They read the names of the people they were marching for. Along the march and when the group stopped, they were making sure others along High Street heard their chants and saw their signs: Black Trans Lives Matter, Protect Black Trans Women. "We're just really energized to encourage others to actually directly support black trans people, black trans women particularly because the stakes are rising higher than ever,” Alexis said. The march ended and temporarily blocked traffic outside Stonewall. "Our members are really suffering right now and we need to make sure that we're holding all of our community accountable,” said Charlie Stewart, co-organizer for Black Queer and Intersectional Collective. "And that goes for any of the LGBTQ centers that have been prioritizing white gay identities.” Earlier this week, Stonewall released a letter apologizing to the Black Pride 4 for the arrests during Pride 2017, writing: We also recognize that the events surrounding Pride 2017 were not isolated. Rather, they were a symptom of a much larger systemic issue of excluding and under-serving the most marginalized in our community, especially people of color and the trans community. Saturday's march was the kickoff of a month of events the Black Queer and Intersectional Collective is hosting. Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc. All rights reserved.
