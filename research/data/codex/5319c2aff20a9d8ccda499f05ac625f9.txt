ERIN DUFFY/THE WORLD-HERALD Central High School cheerleaders who knelt during the National Anthem, from left: Taichelle Butler, Arianna Mercer, C'yera Sherrod, Kendyl Clayton, Erykah Foster and Jaydon Value. ERIN DUFFY/THE WORLD-HERALD Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Under the Friday night lights, six cheerleaders at Omaha Central High followed in the footsteps of three Huskers and other athletes across the country who have silently knelt during the national anthem.The six girls said they took a knee to protest racial injustice and police shootings, joining a movement that's spawned fierce debates over First Amendment rights, patriotism and systemic racism."We don't hate America,” said junior Taichelle Butler. "We want America to be greater.” Photos show several members of the Central marching band kneeled too, while playing the national anthem on the field before the game.At a handful of Friday football games, their protest was one of the only ones observed. The girls said they made the decision to kneel shortly before the game, which pitted Central against Lincoln High, started. Football players were not on the field during the anthem.The cheerleaders said they wanted to bring attention to social issues that have been roiling the country, even if they knew not everyone would agree with their stance. They plan to continue to kneel at future games and encourage other students and fans to join them."It's not just adults trying to change things, it's teenagers, too,” senior Erykah Foster said.All said it was not meant as a signal of disrespect to veterans or anyone in the military. Some critics took to Twitter after a photo of the girls kneeling was posted, asking what their point was.Erykah's mother, LaShanda Loftin, said she was proud to see her daughter take a stand."There's unjust things going on with African-Americans in the United States, and we feel it as black people,” Loftin said. "She asked me if she should do it, and I told her to do what's in her heart.”In the past month, high school, college and pro athletes have been kneeling, sitting or raising fists during the "Star-Spangled Banner,” a protest kicked off by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Kaepernick said it was a way to speak out against racial inequalities and police brutality.Huskers linebacker Michael Rose-Ivey, defensive end DaiShon Neal and linebacker Mohamed Barry knelt during the anthem before last Saturday's game at Northwestern, drawing both cheers and jeers from fans and public officials.Gov. Pete Ricketts called the action "disgraceful and disrespectful,” though Husker football coach Mike Riley, NU President Hank Bounds and University of Nebraska-Lincoln Chancellor Ronnie Green have backed the players and their constitutional right to protest. Veterans and other fans have been split on whether the protests are a peaceful and effective way to draw attention to complaints of racial mistreatment, or a divisive stance that insults police, veterans and other military personnel.Even before the three Huskers knelt, two Nebraska high school football players have engaged in the protest.Lincoln Southeast High football players Sterling Smith and Michael Baklykov knelt earlier in September at a game, and Smith, a senior, said he planned to continue the gesture at every game this season.The two knelt again Friday night.School officials in Lincoln and Omaha have said students are allowed to exercise their First Amendment rights, as long as they're not disruptive.Jim Tenopir, the executive director of the Nebraska School Activities Association, said earlier this month that he's fielded calls from school officials on the issue."My response was that we prefer kids stand at attention, but we also understand that there are people who have very closely held beliefs about social injustice,” Tenopir said during an NSAA board meeting. "Basically, that was my way of saying, 'Local schools, you address that as you see fit.' ”Smith said he received encouragement from some people, and threats from others.The Central cheerleaders said they knew their decision would not be embraced by everyone, but said they had each other's backs and hoped they wouldn't be reprimanded by school officials for the protest."We don't want violence, we just want peace,” junior Kendyl Clayton said. "We want equality.”@central_eagles @eduff88 pic.twitter.com/U73eztG18x— Sean Weide (@sweide) October 1, 2016 World-Herald correspondent Steve Beideck contributed to this report.erin.duffy@owh.com, 402-444-1210 Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save More information Online petition garners more than 5,200 signatures in support of Husker players who knelt during national anthem Andy Liberman, a University of Nebraska at Omaha alumnus who lives in Santa Monica, California, said he started the petition last week to show support for Michael Rose-Ivey, DaiShon Neal and Mohamed Barry, who knelt earlier this month to protest police brutality, police shootings and racial inequality.
