BRANDON SHULLEETA Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save A small demonstration in downtown Richmond, with the message "black lives matter," temporarily shut down several blocks of traffic along East Broad Street this evening."I'm black, and I'm proud," dozens chanted while others held signs that spelled out "Black Lives Matter."After causing congestion for hundreds of motorists for at least 15 to 20 minutes during rush hour, some protesters congregated briefly on a sidewalk at Broad and North 9th streets as police reopened Broad Street. Meanwhile, about a dozen Virginia State Police vehicles with sirens sped down East Broad Street. Richmond police Maj. Steve Drew said some demonstrators had attempted to block an interstate ramp, but Richmond police and state police told the protesters that they would be arrested if they didn't move, prompting the protesters to quickly move.It's one of several protests that have been held in Richmond in recent months with similar themes. Drew said there have been no arrests and no reports of injuries or property damage.Drew acknowledged that some drivers were upset this evening that the demonstrators had caused significant traffic delays. And while police provided drivers detour routes, travel times were still slowed for many. Drew said officers talked with some of those drivers and explained the situation and that police were working on getting them through as quickly as possible. In an interview, Drew thanked the drivers who were inconvenienced for their understanding.He said the department has remained focused on having strong community relations, adding that crime has declined in recent years as Richmond police have increased community policing. He said the department has been trying to balance protecting residents and their rights, while also trying to make sure traffic is not impeded too much, which is why demonstrators weren't allowed to block the interstate ramp."That wasn't going to happen. We weren't going to allow that to happen," Drew said.Protester Vanessa Coleman said that demonstrators were trying to bring attention to numerous issues that affect African Americans, including a push for "justice in public housing," "ending of mass incarceration." Some of the protesters also oppose the idea of a baseball stadium in Shockoe Bottom, she said.She said activists are declaring that if city officials don't "prioritize black lives" and make progress toward certain demands, "we will either disrupt or boycott the UCI bike race." bshulleeta@timesdispatch.com(804) 649-6391Twitter: @ShulleetaRTD Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Tags Steve Drew Protester Vanessa Coleman Driver Highway Motor Vehicle Transports Politics Load comments × Post a comment as Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.
