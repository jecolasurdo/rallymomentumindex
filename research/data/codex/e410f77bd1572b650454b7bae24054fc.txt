Listen now to WTOP News WTOP.com | Alexa | Google Home | WTOP App | 103.5 FM WASHINGTON — Dozens of marchers are on their way to the nation's capital, walking more than 100 miles after they departed from Charlottesville, Virginia, in an effort to speak out against the type of white supremacy that was on display at a violent rally earlier this month. The multiracial coalition left Charlottesville Monday after gathering in Emancipation Park at the statue of Robert E. Lee. There were sermons and speeches in front of the statue as the March to Confront White Supremacy began. "They're marching to protest white supremacy in all of its forms,” said David Singerman with the group Indivisible Charlottesville, which supports the march.

Marchers said they want to draw attention to the violent clashes involving white supremacists and counterprotesters Aug. 12 that broke out ahead of a rally against Charlottesville's plan to remove the Robert E. Lee monument. A Charlottesville woman was killed when the driver of a car plowed into a crowd of people. "The events traumatized a lot of people but also encouraged a lot of people to take action that they hadn't taken before,” Singerman said. Those making the trek to D.C. plan to spend 10 days on the road and are expected to arrive in the nation's capital by Sept. 6 to launch a protest. "They're going to occupy parts of D.C. in a show of peaceful disobedience against the Trump administration.” Singerman said. The marchers also demand that Confederate monuments around the country be taken down and that Charlottesville Mayor Michael Signer resign. On the event's website, organizers said: "It's clear that we can no longer wait for Donald Trump or any elected official to face reality and lead. This is the time for us to stand up for justice and equality.” President Donald Trump faced criticism for his reaction to the Charlottesville violence by saying he believed both sides shared blame for what happened.
