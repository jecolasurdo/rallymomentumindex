Go Hundreds support Black Lives Matter peaceful protest in Airdrie Details Category: Local News Published: Wednesday, 03 June 2020 19:08 Written by Leanne Allison "Change needs to happen, but it's not something we can do alone." Chants of "Black Lives Matter", "Black Lives are Necessary", "Silence is Violence", and "No Justice No Peace" filled the air at Nose Creek Park Wednesday afternoon. Hundreds turned out for a peaceful protest and vigil in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Many attendees wore masks in line with COVID-19 recommendations and held signs with messages of support. Attendees were encouraged to wear black in remembrance of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck in Minneapolis.

The 20-year-old and his family are originally from Nigeria and moved to Canada in 2007. They lived in Brooks and Peace River before moving to Airdrie in 2011. Eshiemomoh told the story about his first bully. His family had been in Canada for less than a year. "I didn't know what racism was," he said. "I didn't feel different. I remember practicing in the mirror as an eight year old, that I was going to stand up to this kid. I remember the night before I did it. I remember playing my words over and over and over again so I wouldn't look weak. I remember standing up to him. I remember being in front of him. I remember being in that boot room of Good Shepard Elementary School of Peace River, Alberta. I remember how I felt." Eshiemomoh talked about the time he felt the most pain, at 12 years old when someone yelled a racial slur at him at a hockey game, a sport he said he joined to feel like he fit in. "I remember skating off the ice and I couldn't get into the dressing room, and I stood there just banging my stick against the dressing room door, crying. All I just wanted to know was why," said Eshiemomoh. "Neither of those people probably remember me, I probably had no impact in their life, but they had huge impacts in mine. And that's why we're here today, because all of us have been impacted in one way, shape, or form. We're going to make change, I promise that." After calling Airdrie home for the majority of his life, Eshiemomoh said it was overwhelming to see the support of the community. "It's beautiful to know that there are people out there that care, that are willing to stand with us. It's amazing," he said. "At the end of the day, I'm no different than any other person here. That's what everyone has to realize. Change isn't going to happen unless everyone speaks up, unless this continues to grow." Eshiemomoh grew emotional at times, trying to find the words to describe what the rally meant to him. "It's years of not knowing that this would ever happen," he said. "It's been a whirlwind of emotions the past week. I'm thankful to see everyone out here. It's a perfect depiction of when people come together, this is what can happen. I'm very proud to see my community out here. It means so much and change is coming, I can promise you that." Eshiemomoh says this is what the world needs. "This is what I've prayed for. This is what I've wanted. And I can tell you there are millions of people around the world that have wanted the exact same thing. I'm grateful, I'm thankful for everyone that's here. I feel blessed."
