Ritchie | eritchie@scng.com | The Orange County RegisterPUBLISHED: June 3, 2020 at 12:55 p.m. | UPDATED: June 4, 2020 at 8:53 a.m.Four Newport Beach demonstrations planned on Wednesday, June 3, each attracted large crowds protesting George Floyd's death and supporting the Black Lives Matter movement. The events were peaceful with the exception of a car that nearly struck protesters as it apparently tried to plow through the crowd at a Balboa Peninsula protest. The protests kicked off at noon, when hundreds gathered at the corner of Pacific Coast Highway and MacArthur Boulevard. With boarded windows on PCH storefronts, onlookers emerged to watch as protesters with signs crowded both sides of the road under sunny skies. The air was filled with protesters' chants and a cacophony of car horns honking in support.

Seconds later, a woman in a passing car yelled, "Oh my god, you're in a f*cking cult!" pic.twitter.com/AAv1T6o236 — Alicia Robinson (@ARobWriter) June 3, 2020 Among the demonstrators was Mark Davis, 59, a pastor at St. Mark Presbyterian Church in Newport Beach. Standing quietly alone in a "Black Lives Matter” T-shirt and his clerical collar, Davis said he thinks a protest of this size, in this city, is "a sign that the winds are changing.” As part of that change, Davis said he'd like to see greater diversity in leadership and better training in police academies. "I think as a nation we have to get away from seeing the gun as the primary means of enforcement,” he said. By 2 p.m., action had moved to the plaza in front of the Newport Beach pier, where about 150 demonstrators gathered with signs that read "Black Lives Matter ” and "Silence = Violence.” We're now at Newport Center Drive & PCH, an incongruous location for this kind of event if ever there was one. What I assume is a police helicopter circles overhead. pic.twitter.com/rCe9JuV6g0 — Alicia Robinson (@ARobWriter) June 3, 2020 The events were peaceful until the driver of a Mini Cooper left a crowd shaken. Around 4:30 p.m., the driver shot through protesters walking in the westbound lanes of Balboa Boulevard. "I had to like move someone aside,” Nisha Syal of Orange said. "We all pretty much got each other, had each others' backs.” A little later, the driver of a Mini Cooper was detained by police. "There was no contact,” said Heather Rangel, spokesperson for the Newport Beach Police Department. "They were actually not hit by the car.” The driver of the white Mini Cooper in this video has been arrested by Newport Beach police. https://t.co/K8He5Jo4p6 — Mayor Will O'Neill (@ONeill4Newport) June 4, 2020 A car tries to plow through protesters in Newport Beach pic.twitter.com/w56hpANSTV — Acyn Torabi (@Acyn) June 3, 2020 Until then, there were no altercations. Protesters' chants earlier in the event included "Use your privilege!” and "Use your vote!.” Police looked on from the foot of the pier and across the street. "I really want cops to not profile as much and be more fair and not hurt people when it's not necessary,” Zac Habal, 28, of Fountain Valley said. "It's just justice, that's all it is.” Habal and his friends came with arms full of water and treats to share with fellow demonstrators on the warm afternoon.

"I just hope to see everything stay peaceful, and it has been so far today and I'm really stoked about that.” Storefronts in the immediate area were not boarded up, but a 7-Eleven nearby did have plywood protecting its windows. By 5:30 p.m. at corner of Pacific Coast Highway and Jamboree Road near the Back Bay, about 200 people had gathered on all four corners to protest while another 100 gathered near City Hall. Karen Rutledge, 58, of Orange, was demonstrating with her daughters, son-in-law, and 7-year-old granddaughter, Mae Or, at the Back Bay location. Rutledge said attending the day's protest was Mae's idea. When asked why she wanted to come to the event, Mae said: "It's just that I have cousins that are black skinned and I want to stand up for them.” The CdM protest was attended by ~500 people, and appears to be largely disbursed at this time. By all accounts peaceful. I'm highlighting this image to give kudos to an organizer who kept it on message and peaceful. And thanks to @NewportBeachPD for keeping watch. https://t.co/HbkjXwehgy — Mayor Will O'Neill (@ONeill4Newport) June 3, 2020 The Police Department had "extensive resources deployed as well as personnel from other city departments and the Orange County Sheriff Department,” Rangel said earlier in the day.
