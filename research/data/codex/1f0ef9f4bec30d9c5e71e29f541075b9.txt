OPINIONYork's Black Lives Matter peaceful protest was a shining moment of unity for this cityScott Fisher, York Daily Record Published 7:59 p.m. ET June 3, 2020 | Updated 9:48 a.m. ET June 5, 2020CLOSE 'We Shall Overcome', sung by Aalyhsia Bartley, floats over a silent crowd during the Black Lives Matter Peaceful Protest in downtown York on Tuesday. York Daily RecordCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREStanding in the middle of the Black Lives Matter Peaceful Protest in downtown York Tuesday evening, doing the Facebook Live video for the York Daily Record, I thought:Yes! This is what this city needed.A shining moment.A perfect example of the right way to do this.It was beautiful.It was diverse.It was inspiring.York businessman Fred Walker took this photo on Tuesday evening during the peaceful protest. He said on Facebook this was the best sign he'd ever seen. (Photo: Submitted)More: In sickness, health and fighting racism: Attending a peaceful BLM protest with my husbandMore: I'm a journalist and a black man. Here's what that's like.This was truly one of the most amazing things I have seen in York, Pa.The young speakers touched my soul. The community leaders who spoke – Mayor Michael Helfrich, Police Commissioner Mo Robinson, Richard Craighead, Carla Christopher – were powerful and impassioned and hit all the right notes.And this whole thing was organized by a pair of 17-year-olds! Wow!Most importantly, this rally lived up to its billing: Peaceful.In a town known for its 1969 racial uprising, for electing a mayor who fomented racial hatred and violence as a cop during that uprising, this was a huge relief.I admit I was worried it could turn ugly. We've seen what's happened in other cities. On Monday evening at another protest that began at Penn Park and moved to the courthouse, a woman was assaulted and her car's roof was stomped in – and police cars parked outside the department were damaged. I was on the streets in 2002 when a white supremacist came to York to speak, and racists and anti-racists clashed. That was ugly! And we'd heard rumors that outside agitators – white supremacists, Antifa, name your protest poisoners – could be coming to York to instigate trouble.If those forces were here, they weren't obvious. Or, who knows, maybe they were overcome by the spirit of love and unity that was clearly on display.At any rate, little-known fact: An hour before the rally, a bus backed into Cherry Lane and unloaded a phalanx of men wearing riot gear — the York County Quick Response Team — into the Appell Center for the Performing Arts. Many have noted the absence of a visible police presence at the event, and I think that was the right call on the part of the city. But they were there and ready if things got out of control.Just the thought of cops storming out of the Strand (fairly or not, a symbol of white privilege among many in the minority community) makes me shiver.Thank goodness that didn't happen because, let's just be blunt: The York City Police Department has a lot of historical racist baggage: siccing dogs on African-Americans, allegations of brutality, racist social media posts, etc. Decades of layers of mistrust have built up between police and minorities in this town.Buy Photo17-year-old best friends, Arlette Morales and Tzipporah Goins lead a demonstration in York City's Continental Square, as protesters took to the streets of York for the second consecutive day, Tuesday, June 2 as emotions continued to boil over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis earlier in the week and the state of policing in America. (Photo: Harrison Jones, For The York Daily Record)More: 30 powerful quotes that help explain the York race riots and the aftermathSo, some of the rhetoric at the protests Monday and Tuesday was understandably strident and angry.I can't imagine what it must be like to live in fear of the police. Well, I can imagine, but I've never felt it viscerally, at the core of my being – and that's an entirely different thing than imagining.I'm a middle-aged white guy. What do I know about feeling that if I get stopped for speeding (which I do all the time), I might not survive the encounter?I've mostly thought of police officers as friends, allies and protectors.And mostly, they are. Most of them are good, hard-working men and women who take their oaths to protect and serve honorably. They have dangerous, difficult jobs. They deal with people who are not thinking straight because they are drunk or high – or have some other problems.But some of them are bad – fundamentally racist or just jaded and desensitized by the ugliness of the job. Some of them abuse their power, treat people with brutality, target them because of the color of their skin. Some of them callously kill people, like I believe former officer Derek Chauvin did to George Floyd, while other cops just stand by like guys leaning on shovels at a road construction site.Buy PhotoYork Mayor Micheal Helfrich joined protesters who took to the streets of York for the second consecutive day, Tuesday, June 2 as emotions continued to boil over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis earlier in the week and the state of policing in America. (Photo: Paul Kuehnel, York Daily Record)My white privilegeBut usually that kind of thing doesn't happen to privileged white people like me, so we just go about our lives obliviously unafraid.Standing in the gloriously diverse and peaceful crowd Tuesday evening, I started checking my white privilege.Am I part of the problem in this town? A few years ago, my wife and I got bored living in the suburbs, sold our house and moved downtown. I didn't really do it to be part of a diverse neighborhood (though it sort of is). I did it to be in walking distance to fun things such as restaurants and bars and the Appell Center.I am at least an indirect driver of gentrification.And then I started thinking that too much of the focus of improving York is focused on the downtown – the bars and restaurants and other businesses we've held up as evidence that York is on the rebound.The recent work of David Rusk YDR published last year showed that some things are getting better in York, but many things aren't. The city is still a segregated bastion of concentrated poverty – and economic, educational and social opportunities for young people are meager.More: Rusk Report 3.0: York is stuck in a 'little box' of poverty. Here's how to break out of itIt's their city, their futureI want us to refocus our efforts on the neighborhoods of this city.I want us to lift young people up, not throw them in prison.I want to harness the positive energy and determination I saw in those young people out on the streets Tuesday evening.I want them to take control of their future – their city.I want them to breathe!Scott Fisher is a York Daily Record editor, State Capitol Bureau Chief and Central region news director.
