School officials told FOX 23 that University of Tulsa cornerback Keanu Hill kneeled as the 'Star Spangled Banner' played ahead of their game in Columbus, Ohio. https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/775121402177421315 In recent weeks, several athletes have protested during the national anthem, following in the footsteps of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Following Saturday's game, the University of Tulsa released the following statement: "Following the Tulsa team prayer at Saturday's football game in Columbus, student-athlete Keanu Hill continued to kneel as the National Anthem was played. A university setting is a place of free expression and open discussion of differing perspectives and opinions, however the actions of one do not speak for an entire group and-in this instance- not for the University of Tulsa Athletics. The National Anthem and salute to the flag are ways we show thanks for our freedom and respect for the men and women who have served our country.‚Äù Close Modal Suggest a Correction Your name(required) Your email(required) Report a typo or grammatical error(required) Submit Suggest a Correction Share this story Latest News Saucee Sicilian to be features on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives Local / 6 mins ago Two coaches test positive for COVID-19 at Edmond basketball facility Local / 51 mins ago Video 4 your garden: How to garden without hurting your back Local / 58 mins ago Video Campaign releases updates on Tulsa Trump rally tickets, requirements News / 23 mins ago Healthy teenager who took precautions died suddenly of COVID-19 News / 1 hour ago McDonald's hiring 260,000 people this summer News / 1 hour ago Video Deer Creek special education student gets hands-on job experience with OKC Energy Local / 1 hour ago Video Texas U.S. Senator introduces bill to make Juneteenth a federal holiday News / 2 hours ago Two new grant programs announced to help Oklahomans impacted by COVID-19 Local / 2 hours ago Two Oklahoma brothers fight to prove their innocence on Friday's 'Dateline NBC: The Long Road to Freedom' News / 2 hours ago Tuition, mandatory fees remain flat for most OSU campuses Local / 3 hours ago Mom thanks Amazon driver for fulfilling young son's 'additional instructions' on delivery News / 3 hours ago Video More News Top Stories Saucee Sicilian to be features on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives Two coaches test positive for COVID-19 at Edmond basketball facility Video 4 your garden: How to garden without hurting your back Video Campaign releases updates on Tulsa Trump rally tickets, requirements Healthy teenager who took precautions died suddenly of COVID-19 McDonald's hiring 260,000 people this summer Video Deer Creek special education student gets hands-on job experience with OKC Energy Video Texas U.S. Senator introduces bill to make Juneteenth a federal holiday Two new grant programs announced to help Oklahomans impacted by COVID-19 Two Oklahoma brothers fight to prove their innocence on Friday's 'Dateline NBC: The Long Road to Freedom' Tuition, mandatory fees remain flat for most OSU campuses Mom thanks Amazon driver for fulfilling young son's 'additional instructions' on delivery Video Read more stories More Stories Cruise lines to suspend sailing from U.S. ports until September 15 Stunning reversal: Navy upholds firing of aircraft carrier captain in virus outbreak Tulsa leaders reverse decision about downtown curfew ahead of Trump's rally Community raising $10 million to restore 'Black Wall Street' in historic Greenwood District Video Read more stories National News What to know about Juneteenth and why people are talking about it now National / 9 hours ago Defying the odds: Ohio man who doctors said wouldn't live past age 11 turns 62 National / 10 hours ago Video You have less than a month to file your taxes.
