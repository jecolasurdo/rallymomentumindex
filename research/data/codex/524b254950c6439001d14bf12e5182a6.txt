School officials told FOX 23 that University of Tulsa cornerback Keanu Hill kneeled as the 'Star Spangled Banner' played ahead of their game in Columbus, Ohio. https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/775121402177421315 In recent weeks, several athletes have protested during the national anthem, following in the footsteps of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Following Saturday's game, the University of Tulsa released the following statement: "Following the Tulsa team prayer at Saturday's football game in Columbus, student-athlete Keanu Hill continued to kneel as the National Anthem was played. A university setting is a place of free expression and open discussion of differing perspectives and opinions, however the actions of one do not speak for an entire group and-in this instance- not for the University of Tulsa Athletics. The National Anthem and salute to the flag are ways we show thanks for our freedom and respect for the men and women who have served our country.‚Äù Close Modal Suggest a Correction Your name(required) Your email(required) Report a typo or grammatical error(required) Submit Suggest a Correction Share this story Latest News OSU Board of Regents approves removal of Murray name on campus buildings Local / 7 mins ago These are the schools reporting coronavirus cases within their athletic programs Coronavirus / 42 mins ago LifeShare of Oklahoma using technology to track organ delivery Local / 49 mins ago ACLU responds after Trump issues warning to protesters ahead of Tulsa rally Local / 56 mins ago Officials report Oklahoma COVID-19 spike as cases grow by 352 in 24 hours Local / 1 hour ago Plaza District postponing 'Solidarity in the Plaza: Black Lives Matter' event due to COVID-19 spike Local / 2 hours ago Shawnee police investigating deadly shooting Local / 2 hours ago Father fights off shark after it bites son at North Carolina beach News / 2 hours ago Gallery Cherokee Nation to reopen cultural tourism sites next month Local / 2 hours ago Everything you need to know about President Trump's rally in Tulsa Local / 3 hours ago OSBI investigating fatal officer-involved shooting Local / 3 hours ago 'Unsafe load': Porsche driver tows hot tub with homemade trailer News / 3 hours ago More News Top Stories OSU Board of Regents approves removal of Murray name on campus buildings These are the schools reporting coronavirus cases within their athletic programs LifeShare of Oklahoma using technology to track organ delivery ACLU responds after Trump issues warning to protesters ahead of Tulsa rally Officials report Oklahoma COVID-19 spike as cases grow by 352 in 24 hours Plaza District postponing 'Solidarity in the Plaza: Black Lives Matter' event due to COVID-19 spike Shawnee police investigating deadly shooting Father fights off shark after it bites son at North Carolina beach Gallery Cherokee Nation to reopen cultural tourism sites next month Everything you need to know about President Trump's rally in Tulsa OSBI investigating fatal officer-involved shooting 'Unsafe load': Porsche driver tows hot tub with homemade trailer Read more stories More Stories Health officials recommend prevention against COVID-19 when attending large gatherings Stunning 'ring of fire' solar eclipse happens this weekend.
