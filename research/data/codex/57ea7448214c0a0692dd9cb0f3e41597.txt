York Daily RecordCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREProtesters took to the streets of York for the second consecutive day on Tuesday, as emotions continued to boil over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who cried "I can't breathe" as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for eight minutes.And those same three words — that trickled from Floyd's lips shortly before his death — became a rallying cry for Pennsylvania residents who protested the state of policing in America this week and demanded justice for Floyd.The group of more than 1,500 protesters in York Tuesday evening first gathered at Continental Square. Some were wearing masks, many were holding signs, and more were crying out for peace.

The 17-year-old said he has grown up amid racial tension and police brutality. And this is the boiling point."This is the last time, they pushed us this far," Sawyer said. "We're trying to make ourselves heard."His mother, Sophia Miranda of Yoe, echoed her son's sentiments with the words "enough is enough." The two stressed that the need to be heard is more important now than ever before, but violence isn't the answer."We don't need to riot to make a change," Miranda said. "This has to be done peacefully. Long as we keep doing this for us, our future will be bright."And even before the protest's official start, as Goins saw the crowd begin to grow, she noted — "This is the most white allies we've seen. We see how much the community has supported this.""We're not the center of attention in all this," Morales said. "The issue is."STORY CONTINUES BELOW GALLERY.FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInPHOTOS: George Floyd protests in Pennsylvania reach York FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

"This is a human being problem."Robinson challenged everyone to think about how they can put themselves in a position to make a difference."While we lift our voice here, we still have work to do," Robinson said. "We can't stop here. We must put ourselves in positions of power where we can make a difference."He left the stage to loud cheers and applause. One of the organizers said York is "lucky to have a police department that stands with us."Buy PhotoProtesters took to the streets of York for the second consecutive day, Tuesday, June 2, as emotions continued to boil over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis the previous week and the state of policing in America. (Photo: Paul Kuehnel, York Daily Record)There was a brief pause in the crowd when the next speaker, Richard Craighead, posed this question to the crowd: "How would you feel if these bright young women who organized this were to die today?"Synchronized claps, unified silence took hold of the atmosphere for a minute. "You'd feel hopeless, wouldn't you?" he continued. "That's how black people feel every day."Monday marked a week since Floyd died in police custody, but protesters also honored the names of Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and countless others who have been killed by law enforcement."Say their names," they repeated, voices getting louder.Away from the crowd, Val Katen held a sign that read "I want to be an ally."The 69-year-old Chanceford Township resident has been to protests before, but she said this one was different. This one was led by the youth, something she believes could be a catalyst. "This is different. Normally it is just us retired folks out here," she said. Back in the thick of the crowd, Damien Morris paced around with a Flyers bandanna for a face mask and a Philadelphia '76ers windbreaker, asking fellow protesters, "You want a slice?” Morris didn't buy the pizza, someone handed it to him. He figured he'd just keep paying it forward. A downtown York resident for the last six years, Morris, said this is the first time he's seen the community come together in such a way. "Everyone feels represented," he said. "It feels like the community has rallied together right now."Many downtown businesses closed ahead of Tuesday's rally. But rather than boarding up their windows, a few took to showing solidarity with the protesters, including The Left Bank and Molly's Courtyard Café. Molly Fisher, owner of Molly's Courtyard Cafe on West Philadelphia Street in York, painted her front window in solidarity with protesters. (Photo: Scott Fisher)"We're trying to bring unity to the cause," Molly Fisher. Fisher, who opened Molly's Courtyard Café in March last year, said she wasn't worried about boarding up windows or proactive measures aside from showing her support for the Black Lives Matter movement. "I'm not worried about anything. If something happens, it happens. It might bring good change," she said. "The louder the better."

A large group met on Continental Square, then a smaller one moved to the York City Police Department steps after the initial event. (Photo: Harrison Jones, For the York Daily Record)After the organized rally ended, scores of people marched south down George Street to Penn Park and then up Beaver Street to the steps of the York City Police Department. The fervor of the crowd intensified as the words "Justice” echoed off the white pillars of the police station on King Street. "No justice, no peace," chants continued to spur through the crowd as members banged on the doors of the police station. Later protesters took a knee, as one member used a megaphone to read off the names of African American men killed by police, ending with George Floyd. Passionate chants and speeches continued for hours as the crowd remained outside the station. York Mayor Micheal Helfrich remained there as late as 9:30 p.m. He spoke in support of the protesters and talked with many in the crowd one-on-one about their concerns.
