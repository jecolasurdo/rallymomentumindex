In an email sent to students and facility, the school and the football described why they made their decision, "Rather than have our message be misunderstood or misconstrued, we are united in our decision to stay in the locker room until kickoff during which time we will engage in a moment of reflection to personally recognize the sacrifice of so many and renew our commitment to living up to those most important words: "with liberty and justice for all."However, many members of the community are outraged over the decision. "I'm very supportive of Millikin sport programs, I'm very supportive of the college as a whole, I've lived here my whole life, however in this instance, I believe they have dropped the ball." said Jewell Young, a Decatur resident. "If some don't agree with the National Anthem, then they should stay in the locker room and come out when it begins. I don't think the whole team should have to stay in because I don't think the whole team feels that way."Steve Little, who has a son at Millikin, also believes that the whole team should not have to stay in the locker room for the National Anthem if they do not believe in the protest. "Maybe the guys who don't want to stand for the National Anthem, black or white, can stay in and let the rest of the guys come out and do it, they should let the rest of the guys that want to come out, come out." he said.There were other members of the community who were not sure how the university should have handled the situation. "It might be a good decision on their behalf, I don't know their reason for it to be exact. But I can't judge anybodies decision, so it might be a good decision on their behalf" said Ahmaad Mathews, a Millikin fan.Some Millikin fans have said they will no longer come to the games as long as Millikin players stay in the locker room for the National Anthem. However, many fans do believe the university has made the right decision.
