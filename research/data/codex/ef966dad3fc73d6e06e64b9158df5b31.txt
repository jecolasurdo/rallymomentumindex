The crowd, which was there to call for justice after the death of George Floyed in Minneapolis, kept getting bigger before heading to the field across from the federal courthouse on Granby Street. Once there, people continued to hold signs high in the air. Some of the messages included "Black Lives Matter" with a picture of George Floyd to go along with it and "No Justice, No Peace." It was the third straight day of protests in Norfolk and in the Hampton Roads area. Saturday, demonstrators rallied in a couple of locations in Norfolk including the police department's operations center and the Confederate monument. Friday, Black Lives Matter 757 held a rally in the city as well as one in Hampton.
