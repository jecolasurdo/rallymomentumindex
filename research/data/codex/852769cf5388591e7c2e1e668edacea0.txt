LOUIS • As the St. Louis Cardinals hosted the Atlanta Braves inside Busch Stadium, about 100 protesters gathered outside, creating a surreal scene on an emotional night on Clark Avenue.The protesters held signs and chanted "This is what democracy looks like!" and "The whole damn system is guilty as hell!"Protesters said they came together days after the third anniversary of the death of Michael Brown, while also enraged by the incidents in Charlottesville, Va., where a car plowed into a crowd of people protesting a white nationalist rally. The latest updates from Charlottesville"I love St. Louis, I was born and raised in St. Louis, but I don't feel free in St. Louis," said protester LaShell Eikerenkoetter, 27. "We want to stand in solidarity and raise awareness and just stand together." There were some confrontations with passersby, one that caused onlooking police to intervene as a man barked at the protesters. Families and fans walked by at times, wearing Cardinal red, while some protesters wore bandannas on their faces and held signs with messages that included obscenities. One baseball fan got into an argument with protesters and did a Nazi salute to provoke the demonstrators. As a couple protesters followed him, he made an obscene gesture and said to leave him alone.Toward the end of the game, Ballpark Village closed the entrance closest to Busch Stadium due to the presence of the protesters. As fans exited the stadium some engaged the protesters by shouting at them. Leon Schmable, 58, of Jefferson County, yelled "all lives matter" and a heated verbal confrontation ensued.Officials with Busch stadium said no injuries were reported.Protesters briefly continued to march throughout downtown before dispersing around 10:15 p.m. Samantha Liss of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report. 0 comments Tags Protester Politics Sport Baseball Be the first to know Get local news delivered to your inbox!
