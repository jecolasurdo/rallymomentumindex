(WDRB) -- Saturday evening a group of about 30 protesters gathered in Downtown Louisville for a Black Lives Matter protest. Organizers say it was a peaceful protest.They want to encourage people to put down guns and come together after the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling earlier this week. "We want to bring unity to the community, we wanted to bring unity within the human race. We wanted to stand for something rather than fall for anything. We want to stand for justice all the lives we've lost over the last couple days all this violence, we want to bring an end to it," said one attendee. Some planned to attend the event and others joined in along the progression.Copyright 2016 WDRB Media. All rights reserved.
