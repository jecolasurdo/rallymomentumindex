He said the focus is to be on "really amplifying our black voices in Worcester,” and creating a "Worcester narrative” within the nationwide movement.In Worcester, he said, "we need an ongoing focus on accountability, in that we hold our (elected officials) accountable, and our (elected officials) hold those in charge of public safety accountable.”The marchers made their way down Summer Street, where they were met by a barricade with several police officers behind it at the police station.After a brief standoff, police Capt. Matthew D'Andrea came out to greet the lead demonstrators, and the march continued around the police station and back toward City Hall.On the way, the demonstrators stopped in front of the courthouse, where they dropped to one knee and chanted "let our people out.”The crowd had regathered shortly after 4 p.m. in front of City Hall, where the demonstrators laid on the ground in protest.The protestors were peaceful throughout the afternoon, and were followed closely by police cruisers and officers on foot.After the demonstration, protester Papee Paye, who shook hands and walked with D'Andrea, said Sunday's work "is never really done, until there's change.”"When there's change, that's when it will be done,” he said. "I'm a peaceful protester. We don't want violence, we just want change.” Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you. Digital access or digital and print delivery.
