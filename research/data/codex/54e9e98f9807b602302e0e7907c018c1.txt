Anti-racists protest Waffle House in New Port Richey May 17, 2018 by Seán Kinane and filed under African American, News and Public Affairs, Police, Race. Share this:Recently there have been several incidents at Waffle House restaurants across the country in which Black customers have felt they've been discriminated against or treated badly. In response, Wednesday morning, an activist group held signs outside a restaurant in New Port Richey to protest Waffle House. WMNF News interviewed Dan Callaghan, a member of the Florida Peace Action Network in Pasco County. They plan to protest again outside the Waffle House on U.S. 19 in New Port Richey on Friday beginning at 8:45 a.m. "A number of us are very concerned that African-Americans seem to be treated badly at Waffle Houses in the last couple of weeks. There was an incident where employees called a complaint in to the police about a woman very upset because she had to pay for a plastic fork. The woman ended up being undressed in public [by the rough treatment of police]. Then there was a second incident just a few days ago involving a young black man in a tuxedo who sat at the table, was called a faggot, and one of the employees said that he'd beat him up. Then there was another incident on the Waffle House site: one of the employees somewhere saw black people coming to the restaurant and locked the door. "So we felt that the only way to get the attention of the corporation was to go to our brand new Waffle House — no sticky floors — and essentially just be outside to let people know that African-Americans are maybe placing themselves in danger if they enter a Waffle House.” What kind of signs did you have? "Well, one of them said, 'Back to Jim Crow and Aunt Jemimah.' Another one said, 'Awful House' instead of Waffle House. And then there was a statement, essentially that said African-Americans endanger themselves by entering the premises. Another one said, 'Danger Zone for Blacks.' That was pretty much the tenor.” Listen: https://s3.amazonaws.com/wmnf/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/WafffleHouseProtestFull.mp3 Here's a link to the Florida Peace Action Network Facebook page. That is Anthony Wall, in prom clothes, being lifted off the ground and choked by a Warsaw County police officer @WaffleHouse. He had just taken his little sister to prom. And yet again @WaffleHouse called the cops. Anthony, of course was unarmed & non-violent. This is assault. pic.twitter.com/lLupZbfMcW — Shaun King (@ShaunKing) May 10, 2018 MLK's daughter calls for a Waffle House boycott after controversial incident https://t.co/vmxOzdAFpY pic.twitter.com/eAyIJis1yz — CBS News (@CBSNews) May 13, 2018 Tags: Dan Callaghan, Florida Peace Action Network, New Port Richey, Pasco County, protest, racism, Seán Kinane, wmnf, WMNF News View/Listen to Archives MidPoint with WMNF News Monday The Traffic Jam – Wednesday It's the Music!

CLOSE Submit an Event EVENT/PSA SUBMISSION GUIDELINES (click here) Community Announcement Guidelines Submitting a written announcement: Enter the information at least two weeks prior to your event for best consideration. It may take up to a week to put it online, so please be patient. If you submit the event last minute, it unfortunately may not be published. If you submit multiple events not all may be published, but we try! Information must be entered in starred fields; others are optional. There is a limit of 250 characters in the text description. Please do not use exclamation points, or type in all capital letters. Remember to fill out the fields for date, time, and venue, if appropriate for your event. Do not include prices, or any word related to cost, including the word 'free.' YOUR ANNOUNCEMENT MAY BE DECLINED if you include prices. Write as if you were addressing a single person. All input is subject to approval and we reserve the right to edit any and all submissions. Please include the proper website, phone number or email address for people who want further information. If you have a question about your submission, please write help@wmnf.org. WMNF reserves the right to publish, decline, or edit all Political Action submissions to protect our FCC & Non-Profit status. All the other guidelines for submitting an event apply to Political Actions as well. If this announcement is for a concert that's not a benefit for a nonprofit organization, you can contact Laura Taylor to find out about being included on WMNF's Concert Calendar, on-air and on our website. We have special rates for local bands: laura@wmnf.org or 813-238-8001 x 132. While we will post some concerts that are posted on the events page, for just a few dollars you can have your event highlighted, add a picture, and be in the concert calendar, which airs multiple times every week. Community Announcement Guidelines The Community Bulletin Board at WMNF is offered as a courtesy to non-profit organizations to broadcast events and fundraisers to listeners within the Tampa Bay region. For priority placement on the Community Bulletin Board, you must represent a 501(c)(3) or (4) IRS-designated organization. We will consider other arts and culture events offered free of charge to the public as space allows. Sorry, WMNF does not do public service announcements for partisan political groups. Record an announcement: WMNF 88.5 FM invites nonprofit organizations to record a 30-second public service announcement for broadcast on 88.5. The guidelines are below. The announcement must be for a registered nonprofit organization. Announcements are recorded with just voice, no music. A person from YOUR organization voices it. Since we're non-commercial, announcements we can't do a Call to Action for another organization. So you can't say "come on down,” "don't miss it,” "sign up now” or anything similar. But you can say, "You can go to (this website) for more information.” WMNF can't announce prices, but you can direct people to a website or phone number for more information. And if it's time-sensitive, we'd want to record that at six weeks before the date, so we have time to get things together and broadcast it for two weeks. PSAs can be about what your group does and when you meet, or about a specific event you're putting on. We'll air one PSA at a time for each group, and the station reserves the right to refuse announcements. You can email a draft of your script to nonprofitpsa@wmnf.org . Once your script is ready, we'll find a good time for you or someone from your group to come to the station and record it.Nonprofit 501(c)3 or 501(c)4 IRS-designated organization?* Yes You must be a 501(c)3 or 501(c)4 non-profit organization to submit events.Name* First Last Email* PhoneEvent Name*Event Date* Date Format: MM slash DD slash YYYY Time : HH MM AM PM Event Location Street Address Address Line 2 City State / Province / Region ZIP / Postal Code AfghanistanÅland IslandsAlbaniaAlgeriaAmerican SamoaAndorraAngolaAnguillaAntarcticaAntigua and BarbudaArgentinaArmeniaArubaAustraliaAustriaAzerbaijanBahamasBahrainBangladeshBarbadosBelarusBelgiumBelizeBeninBermudaBhutanBoliviaBonaire, Sint Eustatius and SabaBosnia and HerzegovinaBotswanaBouvet IslandBrazilBritish Indian Ocean TerritoryBrunei DarussalamBulgariaBurkina FasoBurundiCambodiaCameroonCanadaCape VerdeCayman IslandsCentral African RepublicChadChileChinaChristmas IslandCocos IslandsColombiaComorosCongo, Democratic Republic of theCongo, Republic of theCook IslandsCosta RicaCôte d'IvoireCroatiaCubaCuraçaoCyprusCzech RepublicDenmarkDjiboutiDominicaDominican RepublicEcuadorEgyptEl SalvadorEquatorial GuineaEritreaEstoniaEswatini (Swaziland)EthiopiaFalkland IslandsFaroe IslandsFijiFinlandFranceFrench GuianaFrench PolynesiaFrench Southern TerritoriesGabonGambiaGeorgiaGermanyGhanaGibraltarGreeceGreenlandGrenadaGuadeloupeGuamGuatemalaGuernseyGuineaGuinea-BissauGuyanaHaitiHeard and McDonald IslandsHoly SeeHondurasHong KongHungaryIcelandIndiaIndonesiaIranIraqIrelandIsle of ManIsraelItalyJamaicaJapanJerseyJordanKazakhstanKenyaKiribatiKuwaitKyrgyzstanLao People's Democratic RepublicLatviaLebanonLesothoLiberiaLibyaLiechtensteinLithuaniaLuxembourgMacauMacedoniaMadagascarMalawiMalaysiaMaldivesMaliMaltaMarshall IslandsMartiniqueMauritaniaMauritiusMayotteMexicoMicronesiaMoldovaMonacoMongoliaMontenegroMontserratMoroccoMozambiqueMyanmarNamibiaNauruNepalNetherlandsNew CaledoniaNew ZealandNicaraguaNigerNigeriaNiueNorfolk IslandNorth KoreaNorthern Mariana IslandsNorwayOmanPakistanPalauPalestine, State ofPanamaPapua New GuineaParaguayPeruPhilippinesPitcairnPolandPortugalPuerto RicoQatarRéunionRomaniaRussiaRwandaSaint BarthélemySaint HelenaSaint Kitts and NevisSaint LuciaSaint MartinSaint Pierre and MiquelonSaint Vincent and the GrenadinesSamoaSan MarinoSao Tome and PrincipeSaudi ArabiaSenegalSerbiaSeychellesSierra LeoneSingaporeSint MaartenSlovakiaSloveniaSolomon IslandsSomaliaSouth AfricaSouth GeorgiaSouth KoreaSouth SudanSpainSri LankaSudanSurinameSvalbard and Jan Mayen IslandsSwedenSwitzerlandSyriaTaiwanTajikistanTanzaniaThailandTimor-LesteTogoTokelauTongaTrinidad and TobagoTunisiaTurkeyTurkmenistanTurks and Caicos IslandsTuvaluUgandaUkraineUnited Arab EmiratesUnited KingdomUnited StatesUruguayUS Minor Outlying IslandsUzbekistanVanuatuVenezuelaVietnamVirgin Islands, BritishVirgin Islands, U.S.Wallis and FutunaWestern SaharaYemenZambiaZimbabwe Country Event DescriptionAnything else we should know?
