ATHENS, Ala. – A parent and three students were arrested following an incident that occurred Wednesday at Athens High School and led to a lockdown. Police say Amanda Loggins was charged with resisting arrest and disorderly conduct, along with three students. Wednesday's disturbance at the school happened after five students say they were threatened with 20 days' suspension after being disruptive in a class, according to Athens City School leaders. The students were first told they may have to miss prom and graduation. Parents of four of the students met with principal Rick Carter on Tuesday afternoon to discuss punishment, officials said. Loggins met with the principal on Wednesday morning, but was asked to leave after school leaders say she used "inappropriate language and hostile behavior.” "One guy came in and told everybody, if you didn't have business with the principal to dismiss yourself,” parent Barbara Kirby said. On Thursday evening, Athens police showed WHNT News 19 surveillance video and body camera footage of the incident. The footage showed Loggins refusing to leave the building, and shouting 'Black Lives Matter' near the main entrance. A school resource officer then arrested her and her daughter, who police say were attacking the officer. Video of the incident was taken on several students' phones at the school and posted on social media. School officials said those videos do not show the entire incident. Police are reviewing school video as part of their investigation. "Dr. Holladay said we can all go to prom. It's not going to affect us anymore,” senior Javon Kirby said. The district said it also is investigating a "discriminatory social media post,” made by a student after the incident and that appropriate measures will be taken. There will be more officers at Athens High School the rest of the week as a precaution. Chief Floyd Johnson says the officer involved in the incident won't be put on leave, but will be reassigned starting Friday. The Limestone County Unit of the NAACP decides to investigate A peaceful protest was held at the courthouse square in Athens Thursday evening. The president of the NAACP Limestone County Unit addressed the media. Wilbert Woodruff says the NAACP has a vested interest in any civil rights violations. "Some of the parents and part of our community feel that some civil rights may have been violated,” Woodruff said. He says there are looking into the entire incident, including what district officials say led up to the incident on Wednesday. "The suspension of the children within the school system the day before yesterday then it was the handling of the actual physical altercation that went down yesterday,” he said. At this time, Woodruff says it is too early to tell how long it will take the NAACP to complete their investigation.
