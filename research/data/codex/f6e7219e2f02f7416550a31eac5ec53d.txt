Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Rally participants march on Pilot Knob, speak during meetingA "Justice for Isak Aden” rally stopped traffic for about a half hour Tuesday evening in Eagan as participants marched along Wescott Road, Pilot Knob Road and Civic Center Drive near the Eagan Police Station.The core of their request was for the city to release of all video and audio recordings related to the incident — including body-camera and squad camera footage along with the 911 transcripts — involving the death of Isak Aden on July 2 in Eagan.The rally made its way into Eagan City Council chambers at about 5:50 p.m., while members continued chanting, "No justice, no peace,” "Prosecute the police,” and "Black lives matter,” while hanging a banner across the council's desk.Members of the rally also advocated for the Minnesota Department of Public Safety Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to do a full investigation. They also called for the officers responsible for Aden's death to be fired and prosecuted.The BCA is the lead investigative agency in the incident.

When the City Council's meeting began at 6:30 p.m., the council moved the public comment portion to the beginning to hear the members of the rally speak. Typically, it's at the end of the meeting.Jaylani Hussein, executive director of the Minnesota chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said he understood there's procedures and policies in place preventing the release of the footage, but he said the city can lead the way in changing its policy."We want to know what took place that resulted in the killing of Isak Aden,” Hussein said. "Every single city similar to you makes a decision just like this, but your city can be different today.”Earlier this month, Eagan Police Chief Roger New said body-worn cameras and squad cameras may have captured events of the incident. The Eagan Police Department does not have body cameras at this time, but they do have squad cameras. There were nine other agencies involved in the incident, some of which have body cameras.Michelle Gross, president of Communities United Against Police Brutality, said the city has the power to release the data, according to the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act.She said the data can be released if "it can aid in the law enforcement process, promote public safety, or dispel widespread rumor or unrest.”"I would suggest you have at least one of those conditions and probably all three,” Gross said.She said her organization has evidence that the BCA's investigations aren't of high quality and can have bias."They do a very poor quality job; it's about clearing the officers,” Gross said. Sumaya Aden, Isak's younger sister, spoke of Isak's maturity and generosity.But she said his death goes to show that "you can follow all the rules, you can be the most contributing citizen to American society, you can graduate high school, get your degree, go to college, he was one semester away from graduating college, worked in corporate America, owned his own business and invested in stock, and you can still be a statistic. He didn't make it to 25.” Photo by Andy RogersA "Justice for Isak Aden” rally took over Eagan City Council chambers just prior to the meeting Tuesday evening. Speakers often brought up other past officer-involved shootings in Minnesota including Jamar Clark, Marcus Golden, Philando Castile and Cordale Handy, among others, speaking of the pain that still lingers in those cases and it felt like "déjà vu.”Speakers expressed concerns about the timing of the release of the officers' names, the highlighting of Isak Aden's minor traffic violations by the media, and the record of the officers involved.Some speakers said they had a hard time getting to the meeting due to the roads being closed. Police were redirecting traffic near City Hall and the police station during the march.Hussein said changing the policy would change history and Eagan could be a "light in the north.”"I personally believe Eagan can lead the nation,” Hussein said.The City Council sat and listened for about an hour and 15 minutes before the crowd left chanting, "Eagan can lead,” "Justice for Isak,” and "We'll be back.”After the crowd left, Mayor Mike Maguire thanked everyone who came out. The meeting was recorded and can be viewed on the city website."Any police-involved shooting is tragic, and it's particularly tragic when it ends in the death of someone as it did for Isak,” Maguire said. "We understand that the community has a number of questions, and it's a shared goal for us to answer those questions as quickly as possible. In getting there we'll need to have some patience and allow the justice process to proceed.”He said the city will be as open and transparent as possible without compromising the investigation, but the investigation needs to run its course.He said he's confident in New."I know he's committed to reviewing all the data possible in conjunction with the BCA and to make sure not to interfere with the ongoing investigation with speculation, conjecture and the release of information that might prove damaging to getting to the goal of getting a full picture of what happened,” Maguire said.Maguire said he trusts New will get information to the Aden family as quickly as possible.

I support use of cameras for the protection of ALL peoples' rights including those of the police. Report Add Reply Welcome to the discussion. Log In Keep it Clean.
