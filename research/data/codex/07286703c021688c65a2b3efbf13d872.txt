PHOTO BY MICHELLE STOCKER Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Some 1,500 protesters, many of them students from Madison high schools and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, filled the Capitol rotunda March 9 to protest the killing of an unarmed black man by a white police officer, sending the iconic chant "Hands Up, Don't Shoot” echoing through the statehouse."How is 5 bullets justice?” read one sign lifted in the mid-day crowd that jammed the area typically held by singers protesting the policies of Gov. Scott Walker. "Am I Next?” asked another.With little in the way of an organized program, the protest hastily pulled together March 8 by a pair of UW-Madison students with the help of social media relied mostly on a series of chants by the protesters who packed the rotunda. The chants, at time to the rhythm of improvised drums, grew deafening as the crowd shouted, "I am TR!” They were decrying the death of Tony Robinson, 19, who was fatally shot March 6 by Madison police officer Matt Kenny during a scuffle at a Williamson Street house. Madison Police Chief Mike Koval publicly apologized to Robinson's family March 9. "Reconciliation cannot begin without my stating 'I am sorry,'” Koval wrote in his blog, "and I don't think I can say this enough. I am sorry.” Koval added that he hoped people would not judge his department on this incident. Meanwhile, Mayor Paul Soglin said he wanted the city to set a standard for how communities respond to controversial police shootings, along with addressing broader racial inequities. And Gov. Scott Walker offered condolences to Robinson's family, adding he signed legislation requiring state-level review of such incidents. High school students walked out of school March 9 to attend the protest. Those from West and Memorial high schools traveled to the Capitol by car and bus, while students from Madison East High School marched down East Washington Avenue, with school district Superintendent Jennifer Cheatham walking with them to the Capitol. "Our main focus today has been to keep students safe,” said a school district spokesperson. At the Capitol, Rick, a Memorial High School senior who declined to give his last name, said he hoped the large turnout would help change the way Madison police interact with black youths. Rick, an African-American, said he and his friends often talk about the risk of violence at the hands of a police officer. "It's the same with our parents; we talk about how to be safe.” "We are here because the Madison Police Department murdered one of our children,” Brandi Grayson called to the crowd from the balcony above. Grayson is an organizer with Young, Gifted and Black, a grassroots group formed in Madison last year as a political response to the killing of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. The group has been agitating for an end to racial inequities in Dane County. Young, Gifted and Black on Monday organized the adults present to link arms and line a path from the Capitol steps into the rotunda for the younger students to walk through.Before the protesters entered the building, West High School senior Antonio said that he came because he is against violence and wants to send the message, "I won't stand for it.” Parent Rukiya Swan said she came to the Capitol to support her child and others in their protest."We adults have to mirror how we want our children to make their voices heard,” Swan said. "Ferguson can happen anywhere.”"Ferguson did happen in Madison,” chimed in Theola Carter. "We just haven't had the riots.” Carter, a member of the city's Affirmative Action Commission, said she would introduce the Robinson shooting as a topic to the group at its meeting March 10.And while city and state officials are calling on protesters to await the completion of the investigation being conducted by the Wisconsin Department of Justice, UW-Madison students preparing to march to the Capitol said that the response to the shooting is inspired by more than the loss of one man's life — however tragic. "The issue transcends a single event,” one African-American graduate student who studies societal disparities said tersely. Racial disparities affect her life, said UW-Madison freshman Wynetta McIntosh. "I feel it's my duty to stand up for something like this. There's too much of it going on. I'm fed up,” she said.Another group of undergraduates who learned of the rally and march through an email from the instructor of their gender and women's studies class said racism underlies many American institutions."The racism in this country can be so unconscious,” said Bella Sobah of Madison, who is African-American. "I guess I'm naïve — I didn't believe something like this could happen here.” ￼ ￼The racism in this country can be so unconscious.
