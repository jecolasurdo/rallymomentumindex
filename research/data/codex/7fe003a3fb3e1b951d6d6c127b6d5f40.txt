"We just wanted to show like we can do this we can come together and not argue and fight or go in these people's stores and break stuff, we were out here to handle business and I think it was handled,” said Antoine Campbell. During the protest, anyone could speak and many took up that offer. Some voicing personal stories of injustices they had faced at the hands of police. Others pointing to the city government and city police department as culprits in the matter. However, instead of the concerns just being raised, Chief Barbara Duncan and Mayor Jake Day spoke and also engaged in conversations with protestors about what changes need to be made. "More opportunities for dialogue, more opportunities for mentorship, more opportunities for connectivity and so I heard a lot of that today, and I'm really encouraged,” said Chief Duncan. And in the end, that's what protest organizers say the wanted. A chance for dialogue to starts and a chance for all different types of people to come together. "We wanted to bring the community together and show what real America looks like and as you've seen we had people who was white black Haitian, Hispanic. We had all walks of life here, no hatred all love, and that's how we break the back of systemic racism,” said Andre "Gator” Henry.
