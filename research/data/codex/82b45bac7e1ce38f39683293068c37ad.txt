The judge in the case has not yet issued a verdict. The Garner family and supporters want NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill to fire Pantaleo, regardless of the outcome of a departmental trial. He has remained on desk duty since the 2014 incident."We're asking the commissioner to make the right decision that Officer Pantaleo and all the officers who were involved in my son's death that day need to be off the force," Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, said. "The streets of New York City are not safe with them walking around." Tags: Eric Garner Newsletter All Local FOLLOW US Phone: 877-987-WCBS When texting this station, message & data rates apply.
