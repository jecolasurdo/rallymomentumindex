A safe and respectable community. Lord, we need you now. We need you to touch this family,” one person said. Bradford is the 21-year-old who was shot and killed by police during an incident on Thanksgiving night. The vigil was held just outside the Riverchase Galleria mall where he was killed. "And we need to use this situation to bring honor and glory to your name. That his life was not in vain. That something came from it. That we come together. Not about black or white but about right and wrong," says one pastor who spoke at the vigil. They urged people to use their anger as a motivator to do good, not harm. "To bring grace, dignity, respect and honor to the Bradford family, to EJ and to this community,” a person said. The vigil was a reminder to forgive and a reminder that we are all still brothers and sisters. "EJ was just like us. He was God's creation. Taken from us far too soon," says Benard Simelton of the Alabama State conference of the NAACP. Organizers thanked Hoover police for escorting them to the location. There was also a plea from the family for State Attorney General Steve Marshall to expedite the investigation. Copyright 2018 WBRC.
