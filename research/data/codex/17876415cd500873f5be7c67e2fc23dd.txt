Sacramento Police Officer Tackles, Beats Black Man 'For Jaywalking': SFist News Politics Business & Tech Sports Food & Drink Arts & Entertainment Contact Subscribe News Politics Business & Tech Sports Food & Drink Arts & Entertainment Contact 11 April 2017 / SF News / Caleb Pershan Sacramento Police Officer Tackles, Beats Black Man 'For Jaywalking' Posted by Naomi Montaie on Monday, April 10, 2017 Disturbing bystander video circulating on Facebook shows a Sacramento Police Officer tackling and hitting a man, Nandi Cain Jr., who was reportedly stopped for jaywalking. The video was taken by Naomi Montaie, who told KRON 4 that "I never witnessed or seen anything like that. He just kept hitting him and kept hitting him." The officer has been placed on administrative leave and the incident is being investigated internally. According to a press release from the Sacramento Police Department, the incident took place at 5:07 p.m. yesterday. The pedestrian, Cain, "was observed crossing the street unlawfully near the intersection of Cypress Street and Grand Avenue in North Sacramento." After the violation, the officer exited his patrol vehicle and attempted to contact and detain the man. The officer gave multiple verbal commands for the man to stop but the subject ignored his instructions and proceeded to walk away from the officer. A verbal exchange occurred in the street between the two and the pedestrian began removing his jacket, challenging the officer to fight. The officer charged at the pedestrian to take him into custody. A supervisor, responding to the situation, reviewed the officer's In-Car Camera System and apparently questioned the officer surrounding his actions. "The videos of this incident portray actions and behavior that we would consider unacceptable conduct by a Sacramento Police Officer," the press release states. "As a result, the Department's Internal Affairs Division is investigating the event. This evening, the involved officer has been placed on paid administrative leave pending the outcome of the internal investigation." SFist has contacted the Sacramento Police Department for further comment or update. As of now, the City's Office of Police Accountability is investigating the event further and more In car Camera footage is being reviewed.
