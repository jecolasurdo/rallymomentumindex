Metra, which has been out of service since Monday morning, planned to resume a modified schedule on most lines on Wednesday. The CTA planned to restart bus and rail service to downtown at 5 a.m. on Wednesday, though some train stops located within or near downtown will remain closed, according to the city. Pace suburban bus service also said it plans to resume normal service on Wednesday, including I-55 express service and ADA paratransit service to downtown Chicago.

Marchers guzzled down water and cleared out in front of the banners leading the crowd so George Floyd's name could be clearly seen. Cece Carlson, 28, of Bronzeville, said she came to the march to stand in solidarity and march with her sister. "First and foremost, I'm a black woman so that in itself, my identity, is what brought me out,” Carlson said. "This is my neighborhood.” Carlson said she's tired of police brutality and those who get away with it "over and over again.” "And I'm here fighting for the lives whose names don't get remembered, whose stories don't get told,” Carlson said. "Like Breonna Taylor, and countless others.” Advertisement Carlson said she hopes people are "thinking about not just the actions they're taking in the present but the actions they're taking for the rest of their lives” to support black lives. "And I want to call action to white people,” Carlson said. "What are you white people going to do about it?” Xavier Vance, 29, of Englewood, said he came to the Bronzeville march for "justice for Floyd, justice for every person that was black, wrongfully killed and wrongfully convicted.” Vance said he has been marching "every day, all weekend.” "Sometimes I will just get out of my car and see a protest and join a march, just to support the cause and make sure my voice is heard,” Vance said. "I'm hoping people understand the pain that we go through, seeing our loved ones being murdered by the hands of people that are supposed to protect us,” Vance added. He hopes to keep attending events until there is justice for Floyd and his family, Vance said. "I have twin brothers that I'm concerned about growing up and being a man in this dangerous world that's built to not protect them,” Vance said. "Mainly I'm just hoping that we can get through to those, get through to police officers, and that we can make some change by being out here during the pandemic. And that we can just make some change in the world in general. It's not right that we have to do this during the pandemic. It's not right seeing our people killed for decades.” —Morgan Greene 8:07 p.m.: 'The side of Chicago that somebody needs to see' Protesters, numbering in the thousands, paused every few blocks for short speeches on unity, police brutality and seeking justice for George Floyd from faith leaders including pastors, imams and rabbis. Residents along the drive looked out from windows and held up their phones to film. Signs with messages like "Time 4 Change” and "Jesus Loves Justice” went up as the sun started to set. Nakelia Franklin, 27, of Bronzeville, said she came to the march because, as a social worker, she wants justice for everyone. "I'm a young African American so this just hits home,” Franklin said. "If we don't stand for it then no one else will. "I think people just need to realize that this is real,” Franklin added. "This is real life. This isn't something that happens once a year. It happens every day.” Courtney Kimble, also a Bronzeville resident, set up a chair on the grass to support marchers as they headed south. She said anyone trying to justify the recent tragic events "just ripped my heart out of my chest.” "This is the least I can do,” Kimble said. "We couldn't have asked for a more beautiful day. Every one of these people is beautiful. "This is the side of Chicago that somebody needs to see,” Kimble said. "I hear people chanting about Bronzeville strong and solidarity. This is awesome.” —Morgan Greene Advertisement 7:43 p.m.: Surprise demonstration in Elmhurst a peaceful affair Tuesday evening Roughly 200 demonstrators covered all four corners of North Avenue and North York Street in Elmhurst Tuesday afternoon as they chanted and waved placards demanding racial justice. It was a peaceful gathering, but one that caught the DuPage County city by surprise. Officials announced Monday that organizers had agreed to push back a march and vigil planned for Tuesday by one week "in hopes that the broader criminal behavior that we are alerted to has subsided.” But when they learned people were coming anyway, they sent another alert Tuesday afternoon saying the city had restricted vehicle access to the retail strip along York Street and asked businesses to close by 3 p.m. By 6 p.m., with the demonstration going strong, about half the businesses on York had boarded up their windows. Robert Fonzino, owner of the Bilancio salon and day spa, was still waiting for his carpenter to arrive, regretting that he had lost an afternoon of business on his first day open in 10 weeks. "I don't know what the cause is,” he said. "I think the protesters are fine. I think their hearts are in the right place. I don't think that's the problem. I think it's the thugs that follow. I don't think they have any idea what they're doing other than to be destructive.” But as the evening began, nothing belligerent was happening back at the intersection. Elmhurst resident Yeena Yoo, holding a sign that read "It is better to protest than to accept injustice,” brought her two young kids to the demonstration, saying she had no safety concerns and felt it was important to participate. "I am appalled by the racial injustices that are happening all over our country, so I'm here with my children because I feel it's really important to have peaceful protest, just like Martin Luther King did,” she said. Police from Elmhurst and Bensenville hung back from the gathering, which garnered many honks of support from passing cars. "It's peaceful; there's no rioting or anything like that,” said Andre Sorrell, a Chicago native who has lived in Elmhurst for about a year and a half. "It's been a long time coming ... I have an interracial family so this movement means a lot to me. Anything that can make the future better for my kids, I'm all for it.” —John Keilman 7:06 p.m.: Lightfoot asks Chicago to 'stand for peace' and announces $10 million grant fund to help looted businesses In a televised speech aimed at calming a city rocked by widespread looting, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot on Tuesday evening announced a $10 million grant fund for looted businesses and promised to implement a series of long-stalled police reforms. Lightfoot also laid out a series of measures she has ordered new Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown to implement within 90 days as part of a broader effort at reforming the long-troubled department, some of which have been languishing for years. "If there is to be an uprising, let it be for peace. I call on all people of good will, young, old, black, brown, white, Asian, from all faith traditions, to rise up with me for peace,” Lightfoot said from her City Hall office. "Stand for peace.” The police reform measures Lightfoot wants to implement include teaching Chicago cops about "the history of neighborhoods taught from the perspective of community members, inspired by youth-led neighborhood tours done by My Block, My Hood, My City. The city also will implement an officer wellness program and complete an officer support program that supports cops in crisis, mandate crisis intervention and procedural justice training for all officers, and establish a new recruit program on police-community relations and community policing with views from the community about what works, she said. Referring to damaged businesses around the city, Lightfoot said, "We will clean up these broken windows, but we can't stop there. We must also clean up and repair our broken systems.” Lightfoot said the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd is linked to a history of racism in America and police misconduct exemplified by Laquan McDonald's murder and infamous city cop Jon Burge. She said "four shameful Mineapolis police officers who took his life." But Lightfoot took a strong stand against looting, saying the city can't allow its pain to "spill over into violence and destruction against our communities." "I will never stand for stealing the dreams and livelihoods of our neighbors. I will never stand for abandoning our values and our love of this city,” Lightfoot said. "My heart is broken over what has happened here in the city that I love.” —Gregory Pratt 6:44 p.m.: Marching for peace and justice in Bronzeville On a sweltering Tuesday evening, dozens of faith and community leaders gathered in Bronzeville to lead a peaceful march in memory of George Floyd. Shortly after 6 p.m., leaders of various faiths led the crowd in prayers. On the count of three, the marchers joined together in "Black Lives Matter” and started walking to music. The crowd pumped their fists as voices in the song cried, "Hands up, don't shoot.” Those at the front of the march held banners saying "George Floyd” and "Black Lives Matter.” Organizers said they planned the march for South Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive as a symbolic gesture, to represent its peaceful nature. Some nearby residents placed bottles of water on the sidewalk for those marching. Others held signs with messages like "Peace and Justice.” The crowd headed south toward East 51st Street and the protest was expected to end at Washington Park. —Morgan Greene 6:36 p.m.: McDonald's, Walgreens and the Cubs among companies condemning racism in wake of George Floyd's death While small businesses tend to broken store windows and damaged merchandise amid fallout from George Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police, brands such as Nike and Amazon are busy weighing in on systemic racism in America. McDonald's, Walgreens and the Chicago Cubs are among the Chicago-area companies that have posted social media messages, sent letters to employees and held town halls in recent days denouncing discrimination, and pledging commitments to diversity and inclusiveness. "When any member of our McFamily hurts, we all hurt,” Joe Erlinger, president of McDonald's USA, said in a public LinkedIn post Saturday. It is not clear if the messages will resonate with customers, employees and a nation reeling from the COVID-19 pandemic and more than a week of widespread social unrest, but brands are nonetheless racing to position themselves as champions of social justice.

Testing sites in Harwood Heights, Aurora, Rockford, East St. Louis, Bloomington, South Holland, the Chatham community area, Champaign, Rolling Meadows and Peoria would reopen Wednesday. The Waukegan site will reopen Thursday in a new location to accommodate the return of vehicle emissions testing at the previous location. Advertisement Gov. J.B. Pritzker said Monday that some of the testing sites had to be shut down because local law enforcement weren't able to provide protection for Illinois National Guard members staffing them during the unrest. "It's one of the unfortunate consequences of what's happened is we can't have Guardsman out there unprotected providing the testing,” Pritzker said. —Dan Petrella 5:47 p.m.: National Guard set to deploy to suburbs Tuesday night More than 200 Illinois National Guard members are in final preparations for deploying to the Chicago suburbs Tuesday night, according to Gov. J.B. Pritzker's office. Their mission, in terms of location, will be flexible so troops can respond to situations as they evolve. The guard will only provide assistance when requested by local law enforcement, Pritzker spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh said. The guard's availability comes as local law-enforcement officials are monitoring potential unrest in Downers Grove, Elmhurst, Joliet and Oak Brook Tuesday night. The governor activated 250 additional guard members this week to help quell violence and vandalism in the metropolitan area. He also has deployed 375 soldiers and airmen to Chicago to assist with street closures. The soldiers and airmen have been given explicit orders not to interfere with protesters who are exercising their First Amendment rights, the governor said. In the suburbs, troops will be deployed to communities in platoons of 30 to 40 members. "We are doing — and will do — everything we can to protect private property,” Pritzker said Monday. "We'll continue to deploy as needed.” A day before the activation, the Illinois National Guard provided aerial support during unrest in downtown Aurora Sunday night. In addition the guard units, the governor ordered the Illinois State Police to provide an additional 300 troopers to support local municipalities. He also issued emergency proclamations for nine counties in Illinois to expedite the use of state resources, personnel and equipment to restore order. —Stacy St. Clair 5:45 p.m.: Joliet mayor says he was acting in self-defense when he grabbed and shoved a protester in skirmish caught on video Joliet Mayor Bob O'Dekirk released a statement Tuesday saying he was acting in self-defense during a skirmish with a protester Sunday evening. A video of the scuffle, which emerged Tuesday, shows a chaotic scene of police dispersing a crowd of people Sunday evening who had gathered in protest of the alleged murder of George Floyd by Minneapolis police. The video appears to show O'Dekirk grabbing a man by his collar and forcibly walking him toward a police car several yards away when a second person attacks the mayor from behind. O'Dekirk and the first man appear to fall to the ground and are quickly surrounded by several other officers. It's unclear from the video what prompted O'Dekirk, a former Joliet police officer, to place his hands on the first man. O'Dekirk said he acted in self-defense after he was "confronted by a rioter and then attacked,” adding later the unidentified man tried to shove him.

On Tuesday, a local advocacy group for biking and transit launched a petition to bring back Divvy, as well as full CTA service. But Mayor Lori Lightfoot said both the CTA and Divvy bikes have been used to commit crimes, and she could not turn a "blind eye” to the issue. The Active Transportation Alliance said in a blog entry that while it appreciated the position faced by Chicago leaders, "we need reliable transportation options more than ever.” Metra has been out of service since Monday morning, and both CTA and Pace suburban bus service shut down service on Sunday and Monday nights. CTA has limited service during the day to avoid wide areas of the city, including downtown. Pace also has not been coming into downtown Chicago, though it plans to resume normal service on Wednesday. Read more here. —Mary Wisniewski 4:30 p.m.: Lightfoot to give televised address this evening Amid ongoing civil unrest following the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot will give a televised address this evening that's largely expected to encourage the public to stay calm. Lightfoot will speak at 6:30 p.m. from her ceremonial office, and "deliver a State of the City Address to Chicago's residents from her ceremonial office to contextualize events that have happened in recent days,” her office said. You can watch Lightfoot's address live here. The mayor has spent the past several days pleading for peace as protesters marched and traveling mobs of citizens pillaged stores in the neighborhoods. The city has blocked off downtown roads to keep non-residents or workers out – a decision that's been criticized as prioritizing the Loop over neighborhoods, though Lightfoot defended the decision by saying it allowed officials to put police in neighborhoods. —Gregory Pratt 4:20 p.m.: Insurance should help businesses damaged during unrest, but merchants question whether it will be enough The looters who on Sunday ransacked Z Smoke Shop, which has been selling glass pipes and vaping products in Logan Square for eight years, left behind not only major damage but also empty shelves that could take weeks to fill. "We will be closed for a good while,” said manager Kyle Korab. "There isn't one piece of glass that isn't broke.” The business called its insurance company immediately. Now it's waiting, nervously, to see if its claim is approved. "We're not 100% sure,” Korab said. "They might find a reason to not cover it.” Read the story here. —Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz 4 p.m.: Protesters march from Wrigley Field to Old Town A large group of protesters moved south down Clark Street from Wrigley Field around 2 p.m., trailed by several cars and even a van toting water to keep marchers hydrated. Bryan Cho said he has been volunteering his car as a caravan and supply van for three days now. Advertisement "Water guys, take as many as you need,” he said. More than 20 cars appeared to be following along with the group, handing out water. At the corner of Clark and Drummond Place, Laura Janota took a break from watering her garden to pour water onto exhausted marchers. "I was watering my garden and I heard them coming, so I brought my watering can out to provide some relief,” she said. Crowds of predominantly young people streamed down sidewalks southbound on Clark clutching bottles of water and makeshift signs. Many chanted "Black Lives Matter” as police on bike guided the crowd. Part of the crowd stopped at Clark and Menomonee Street where a few hundred conducted a sit in. After marching to the north end of Old Town a little after 3 p.m., and making briefly for Lake Shore Drive, much of the group headed back north on Clark Street, although some split off and headed west. —Jessica Villagomez 3:22 p.m.: Grocery delivery could be tougher to come by as George Floyd fallout continues Delivery services like Amazon, Instacart and Shipt say they have scaled back services in cities including Chicago amid ongoing unrest and looting. Fallout from the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd sparked protests and civil unrest in cities across the country, including Chicago. A 9 p.m. curfew is in place in the city, where some damaged stores remain closed and others have reduced their hours. That could make grocery delivery tougher to come by at a time when consumers, concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic, have been relying on the services to avoid unnecessary trips to the store. Shipt, which delivers products from stores including Target and CVS, has temporarily suspended service in the downtown Chicago area. Outside downtown and in the suburbs, it adjusted hours to comply with local curfews or earlier closing times at stores offering the service, the company said in an email. Amazon, which owns Whole Foods, said it adjusted routes or scaled back delivery options to ensure workers' safety in a handful of cities, including Chicago.

J.B. Pritzker and Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle on Tuesday turned to religious and community leaders to urge protesters to channel anger over the death of George Floyd toward efforts for criminal justice reform and economic development in minority communities. "What's very important to me is that we establish an agenda — an agenda that's led, in part, by the very peaceful protesters that are out on the streets, that were there protesting last night, the night before and the night before, the folks who there with legitimate grievance,” Pritzker said. Preckwinkle encouraged those angered by the "racist, preventable death” of Floyd, who was African American, at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis to "seize this moment and try to bring freedom and justice to every American.” "We cannot do this by destroying our communities,” said Preckwinkle, a Hyde Park resident. "We cannot do this by decimating what makes our black and brown communities so strong, so close-knit, even in the face of decades, generations of racist government policies and disinvestment.” Read more here. —Dan Petrella 3:10 p.m.: Top cop says National Guard troops patrolling neighborhoods would be 'wrought with failure' Chicago police Superintendent David Brown on Tuesday explained his opposition to having National Guard troops patrol the city's neighborhoods to quell protests, looting, and other unrest that has flared since the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd. "Let's revisit how we got here: We got here for an inappropriate use of force in Minneapolis,” Brown said at an unrelated news conference Tuesday. "We got here through police officers not following their training in positionally asphyxiating a person until they died — caught on tape, and we've seen it over and over again to all of our embarrassment. "And now you want to call in the National Guard who are not suited to use force in the ways all of our residents expect? All the hard work that our profession has ... trained ... I want to turn over to a National Guard that's not trained, has no connection to our neighborhoods, have not been engaged, who have not built trust, to bring us back to the place we started?” Brown said. "We're not considering that.” Brown also noted that National Guard troops don't have the training in de-escalation as police officers do, and asking them to step in is "wrought with failure.” "What is the likely outcome when rocks are thrown at the National Guard? When shovels and other (objects), hammers, when shots are fired from a crowd at the National Guard?” said Brown. "Likely not the restraint, the patience that our officers have utilized. "They don't have the training in any of those areas or the experience, and to ask them to come into our neighborhoods and be faced with those critical split-second decisions without the training is obviously asking for more of the same,” he continued. Brown also addressed the "looters' tactics,” and their connection to protests and the challenges police face. "They peacefully protest and then they end the protest, while all at the same time factions of peaceful (protesters) are in the crowd ready to loot as soon as peaceful protests end ...,” Brown said. "And then our officers have to both navigate First Amendment-sacred rights, but at the same no tolerance for looting.” He also urged the public to help businesses board up their windows and rebuild the city. He said he needs the public's help with pushing back against rumors on social media "that fuel some of the divisiveness” in the city. Such rumors about the civil unrest has caused anxiety among the public, he said. —Jeremy Gorner 2:19 p.m.: Tinley Park imposes curfew ahead of scheduled protest Mayor Jacob Vandenberg of suburban Tinley Park said a temporary curfew has been reinstated for Tuesday night, starting at 8 p.m. Tuesday and ending at 6 a.m. Wednesday. He cited a protest expected to take place this evening at the Oak Park Avenue Metra station. The village is requesting that businesses along Oak Park Avenue close at 3 p.m. Tuesday. "The Village is taking these measures to ensure the safety and security of residents and businesses. We appreciate your cooperation and understanding,” the mayor said in a released statement. —Chicago Tribune staff 2:15 p.m.: Lightfoot says she'll see Trump in court if he tries to send in military: 'This is a man who likes to bluster' Mayor Lori Lightfoot dismissed President Donald Trump's threat to send the military into city streets across the country to quell protests as "bluster,” but promised to fight such a move in court if tries it in Chicago. Advertisement "That's not gonna happen,” Lightfoot said Tuesday. "I will see him in court.” Referring to a 2017 incident where Trump tweeted, "Send in the feds!” about city violence, Lightfoot said, "Keep in mind, this is a man who likes to bluster. Let's not overreact.” Late Monday, Trump held a Rose Garden news conference to threaten he would mobilize the U.S. military to end "riots and lawlessness” in states that have erupted since the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd. It was unclear what form such an action might take. Trump then walked across Pennsylvania Avenue to St. John's Church, where he held a Bible for a photo-op, after federal officers had used tear gas, flash bangs and rubber bullets to clear peaceful protesters to make way for the president. Gov. J.B. Pritzker appeared on CNN as the scene unfolded and condemned Trump's actions. Lightfoot's comments Tuesday marked the latest exchange between Chicago's mayor and Trump. Lightfoot last week responded to Trump tweeting a message that included, "When the looting starts, the shooting starts” in reply to rioting in Minneapolis and elsewhere following Floyd's death. Lightfoot said the president cannot be allowed to divide and destabilize the country.

Police have taped off the station. By a little before 2 p.m., a sizeable crowd had gathered in front of Wrigley. Many people were hauling packs of bottled water and first aid supplies as temperatures push 90 degrees. "This is not a riot!,” the crowd chanted. 2:03 p.m.: Naperville businesses, residents get down to the business of cleaning up after looting Naperville residents awoke to a shattered downtown Tuesday, as a previous night of unrest led to looting and vandalism in the city's main shopping and eating district. And then they got to work. Sonya Mingo-Williams and her two children left their Naperville home with brooms and trash bags at 6 a.m., just as a citywide curfew lifted. They arrived to find hundreds of like-minded Naperville residents ready to clean shattered glass from the sidewalks and scrub vandalized buildings. People smashed stores windows along several blocks Monday, including the local library, Starbucks and Chico's clothing store. In addition to being vandalized, the Pandora jewelry store was entirely ransacked. "This is our town, and we were so disappointed by what happened last night,” she said. "We wanted to come down and help as soon as we could.” Mingo-Williams watched the violence unfold via social media Monday and was disheartened by the crimes she saw. She had attended a peaceful protest earlier in Naperville earlier in the day with her two children and it troubled her to watch the positive messages sent during that nonviolent gathering overshadowed by the destruction. "As a black family, we have talked to our children and it's hard to see what's going on in this country,” she said. "We tell them that they can help bring about change. Our message is strong and our message is important. And in this moment, people have tried to exploit it.” An estimated 300 people marched through the downtown Monday night, as police officers in riot gear watched. At least one person reported being stabbed, but police had not yet determined whether he had been injured by broken glass or a knife. A police officer was injured by a fireworks, officials said. His condition was unknown. As he surveyed the damage Tuesday morning, Mayor Steve Chirico said police had photographed license plates of cars parked in public garages and lots to determine where the participants live. The analysis has not been completed, but he said early indications are between 80 to 90% did not live in Naperville. Chirico met with protestors earlier in the day, urging them to get involved in their communities by volunteering and supporting political candidates who believe in social justice. The nonviolent protest's message is now obscured by the nighttime unrest, he said. "I think it is lost,” Chirico said as his voice choked with emotion. "And that's unfortunate because people tried to do something good.” There were still signed of goodness in Naperville that morning, as estimated 700 people helped with clean up efforts. The group had most it cleaned up by 7:45 a.m., as local businesses showed the gratitude by plying the volunteers with free food and drinks. "I wasn't here to help with the (peaceful) protests yesterday and I felt like I needed to help,” said Lisle resident Catt Eicher as she swept to up tiny shards of glass along Jackson Avenue. "It's better than looking at Twitter and feel sad (or) angry.” The town's response heartened Councilman Benny White, who marched in the nonviolent protest earlier Monday. "The great thing, for me, is seeing the resilience of our community,” said White, the city council's only African-American member. "People are down here lending a hand and making it happen. I'm extremely proud of our community.” —Stacy St. Clair 1:22 p.m.: Evanston police take 12 people into custody following Best Buy looting incidents Twelve people were taken into custody following two looting incidents at a Best Buy in Evanston, according to police. Evanston police responded to a report of looting at the Best Buy store on Howard Street Monday afternoon around 2:30 p.m., said Evanston police Commander Brian Henry. "We had people right around the corner,” Henry said, so police responded right away after receiving the call. Police took a total of five people into custody following that "organized” incident Monday. That follows a similar incident at the same store Sunday evening in which seven people were taken into custody, Henry said. None of the 12 people taken into custody over the two days were from Evanston, Henry said. Police said they do not believe the incidents were connected to what was a peaceful protest Sunday afternoon. Charges were pending as of Tuesday morning. —Genevieve Bookwalter 12:57 p.m.: Feds charge 2 more people in connection to weekend looting in Chicago Two more people face federal charges following looting in Chicago over the weekend. Brandon Pegues and Amber L. Peltzer, both 28 and from the south suburbs, were charged Monday with illegal possession of a firearm. This follows federal charges against Matthew Rupert, 28, of Galesburg, for allegedly driving to Chicago and Minnesota to loot and riot. Early Sunday, around 12:40 a.m., Chicago police officers responded to crowds near 801 South Financial Place, authorities said. The officers saw four men running south, some carrying hammers, according to court filings. Advertisement Pegues looked at the police, adjusted the right side of his waistband and fled south on South Financial Place, according to the complaint. As officers chased him, he fell and a loaded 9 mm pistol dropped on the ground. Pegues pushed it under a car, where police recovered it, the complaint said. Around the same time, officers approached Peltzer sitting in a car in front of a bar at 16th Street and Michigan Avenue after noticing the glass front door of the business was shattered, according to the complaint. An officer saw Peltzer reach toward the front seat and the officers saw a loaded handgun lying there, authorities said.
