Hearst has been involved in two fatal shootings in the past five years. He was one of three officers who fatally shot Merle Hatch, 50, who had been diagnosed with mental illness. He was carrying a broken telephone handset, which he said was a gun. A grand jury also found no wrongdoing in that case.AdvertisementAt the service, Quanice's cousin Terrence Hayes delivered an eight-minute eulogy that fondly remembered "Moose” and also touched on the relationship between African Americans and police.In Case You Forgot, Cops Are Still Killing Black PeopleDoes Donald Trump go to the beauty-supply store to buy his Remy hair or does he send the Secret...Read moreAdvertisementBefore Terrence Hayes spoke, about a dozen friends and family members stood before the audience to remember Quanice.

Some held a banner reading "Justice for Quanice Hayes.”AdvertisementFor at least 15 minutes, they stood in the pouring rain chanting, "Say his name: Quanice Hayes,” "Hands up, don't shoot” and "Black lives matter.”AdvertisementThe grand jury on Tuesday said that Officer Hearst was justified in shooting Hayes three times—once in the head, twice in the torso. Police had been searching for an armed robbery suspect who supposedly matched Hayes' description.Read more at The Oregonian and KCW.Angela HelmPostsTwitterMs. Bronner Helm is the Senior Editorial Director at Colorlines.
