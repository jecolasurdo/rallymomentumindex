Residents said the protest was a town first. Lance Reynolds. Republican-American BRIDGEWATER — Liam Kay felt so inspired after attending last week's Black Lives Matter protest in Washington Depot that he felt he needed to organize a protest in his hometown. The 22-year-old Shepaug Valley High School alum did just that. More than 30 residents Wednesday congregated on the Green lining Route 133 to signal how [...] LOG IN REQUIRED LOG IN to your account REGISTER to access your 5 FREE ARTICLES a month.

BLM Stamp out racism wildbill June 11, 2020 At 1:42 am These small Litchfield County towns seem to revel in the current fad of "peaceful protest,” ostensibly to assuage their guilt over their "white privilege” so that they can gloat over their atonement at the next cocktail party. blessed1 June 11, 2020 At 12:46 pm Change will NOT come until the REAL problems are identified and people NOT benefiting financially from those problems, are allowed to identify, address & institute solutions to those problems. Well intentioned Sheeple, actually prolong the suffering & give continued cover to the real perpetrators of theses heartbreaking problems. Some actual research, into what the REAL problems are, how they came to be, and how we can fix them, would be much more useful than what we are seeing unfold, that only makes matters worse. Ask innocent people in the inner cities caught in the crossfire how this has worked, or the families of the innocents killed in these riots ..... . Actual front liners, doing God work are......Bob Woodson, Shelby Steele, Peter Kirsano, Horace Cooper & Candace Owens to name a few. Reading what they have to say, would be a good place to start your journey to truth. Marching, chanting, burning, looting, killing & supporting the anarchists who are destroying the greatest nation on earth, have all been tried before. What have we got to lose by actually looking at factual information and trying that route to improve the lives of ALL God's children ?? blessed1 June 11, 2020 At 1:26 pm Wh Comments are closed.
