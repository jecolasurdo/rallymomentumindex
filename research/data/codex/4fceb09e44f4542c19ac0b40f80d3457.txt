Print Protesters demonstrating against the killing of George Floyd clashed for hours with police on the streets of downtown Los Angeles, blocking the 110 Freeway, damaging cars and property and getting into a series of tense altercations with officers. Looting and vandalism were reported across the area early Saturday as police tried to push out the demonstrators, many of whom were arrested and hustled off in buses. At least four LAPD officers were hurt, some after being hit by debris.Fireworks were set off in the streets, the sparks hitting buildings. Smoke filled the air as some people broke into shops, making off with tennis shoes, clothing and electronic items such as television screens and speakers. Looted jewelry lay scattered on the sidewalk and in the road, with some people stopping to scoop some of it up and others distributing it to bystanders. Buildings were spray-painted with profanity and anti-police statements as well as Floyd's dying plea as he lay pinned to the ground by a Minneapolis police officer: "I can't breathe.” Advertisement Along 6th Street, between Spring and Broadway, residents watched the action below from their lofts and apartments, sometimes egging demonstrators on as they drank beer and took video footage of the chaos. Some pleaded with demonstrators not to damage their cars parked on the street.One local business owner, Pedro Mojarro, stood outside his burger eatery to protect it. Mojarro, 32, said he supported the demonstrators but was upset that they were targeting businesses like his."We're with you — I'm not against you. If you need to protest, go do it in front of the police station. Be angry at them,” Mojarro said, adding: "I'm just a business owner trying to survive.”The situation had deteriorated around midnight as several jewelry stores were broken into and looted along with a CVS drugstore. A nearby Whole Foods Market was damaged. One person threw a scooter into a plate-glass window at one business, while another person offered a reporter a handful of jewelry on the street. Advertisement Police said there were numerous burglaries by "opportunists” not necessarily connected with the original protest that began Friday afternoon with a march on City Hall and Los Angeles Police Department headquarters."I think when we hit daylight we will see the destruction. We lost at least two police vehicles to fire,” said LAPD Assistant Chief Robert Arcos.A Starbucks on Spring Street was vandalized, its windows smashed and painted with slogans such as "End Racism” and "Brown Power Unite.” Furniture from the store was thrown onto the street.One business on 6th Street sported a signed that read "Black owned.” The windows of the salon next to it were broken.
