HaysIndyStarA growing crowd spilled out from under the overhang at the entrance of the City-County Building, huddling under umbrellas in the humid air and steady rain."It's been a long time coming,” Megan Simonton sang, "but I know a change is gonna come.”To her left, Aaron Bailey's family wept.Around 100 people gathered at the Downtown Friday night to protest the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police civilian merit board's decision to reinstate the officers who shot and killed unarmed motorist Aaron Bailey.Local organizations including Indy 10 Black Lives Matter, DONT SLEEP, Faith in Indiana, Showing Up for Racial Justice, the Muslim Youth Collective and Indy Feminists spoke at the rally, which called upon Chief Bryan Roach to pull the officers from patrol and place them on administrative duty.The chief's executive officer said Roach had no comment regarding the officers' assignments.The shooting happened in the early morning hours of June 29, 2017, following a traffic stop and vehicle pursuit on the city's north side.Within 18 seconds, officers Carlton J. Howard and Michal P. Dinnsen fired 11 rounds into the vehicle, striking Bailey four times in the back. A passenger in the car was uninjured. Although a special prosecutor declined to press criminal charges against the officers, Chief Bryan Roach recommended them for termination, saying their use of force was not within department policy. The board disagreed. Bailey's daughter, Erica Bailey, said that while her emotions were still raw, she still felt compelled to act."I'm not gonna lie to you, I don't sleep really good at night," she said. "So me, I'm gonna turn my pain into power."Her voice broke as she spoke of her family's pain. Of how hard she's going to keep fighting. As she pleaded for the officers to admit that what they did was wrong, and reminding them that God forgives.She cried as she addressed the several young children among the crowd."I want you all to understand that it's OK to fight back," she told them. "It's OK to stand up when you believe in something. And don't let nobody tell you nothing different, do you hear me?" After the board's vote last week, Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett released a statement calling the decision "disappointing and frustrating." He also suggested changing the merit board system, although it is unknown what changes he would seek.Merit board changes:Board's composition would change dramatically under Indy council president's proposalPence on school shooting:He pledges new resources to 'end this evil against our children'City-County Council President Vop Osili has since drafted a proposal that would dramatically change the makeup of the merit board, including increasing the size of the board and giving the council and local Fraternal Order of Police more influence over who serves.On Friday night, ralliers erupted into cheers as one speaker called for the merit board to be abolished.Satchuel Cole, vice president of the social-justice organization DONT SLEEP and founder of IMPD Transparency, called upon Roach to keep the officers out of patrols and assign them to administrative duties."We want to ensure that these officers are in a position that they cannot pull anyone over and do this to someone else," Cole said.Rosie Bryant, of Faith in Indiana, said it was important for the community to stand united. "I'm standing out here because my son is an Aaron Bailey," she said. "Aaron Bailey was not just a man of faith. He was our brother, he was our sister, he was our neighbor, he was someone's child. And that can happen to any of our family members." During the rally, her son, Hakeem, took the microphone."I'm only 20 years old, and I'm already tired,” he said before reciting his poem, "All I Ever Wanted.”"All I ever wanted was love,” he said. "All I ever wanted was respect. All I ever wanted was to be free.”Call IndyStar reporter Holly Hays at (317) 444-6156.
