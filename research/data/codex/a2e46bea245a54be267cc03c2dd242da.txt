Witnesses say the people were protesting the Bradley Blackshire shooting. Blackshire was shot and killed by Little Rock police officer Charles Starks in February. Starks was cleared in the shooting and later fired by the police chief. At around 1:30 p.m. the Little Rock Police Department (LRPD) was notified of a protest at the Pulaski County Prosecuting Attorney's Office, located at 224 S. Spring Street, that's according to an LRPD news release. Police say that during the protest a portion of 3rd Street was blocked by protesters, not allowing motorists to travel in the area. Officers provided multiple verbal warnings for protestors to return to the sidewalk and to exit the Boadway. Upon providing these warnings, the protestors returned to the sidewalk and began walking towards Broadway Street, according to the news release. The group of protestors continued walking in the area using sidewalks and crossing lanes from 3rd Street to Broadway. While walking in the crossing lanes, LRPD says the protestors walked in a manner that impeded traffic flow. Shortly after, the protestors walked north on Broadway Street in the direction of Markham Street. While at the intersection of Broadway and Markham, a group of protestors walked eastbound on Markham crossing Broadway Street while Broadway traffic signals were green for motorists to travel north and southbound, police say. At this point, the group of protestors again began to impede the flow of traffic for motorists, LRPD says. The decision was made by City Administration that the protestors would not be allowed to disrupt traffic and for them to be arrested for disorderly conduct. A total of ten protestors were arrested and taken to the Pulaski County Jail for processing. During the course of the transport, one suspect complained of feeling ill. Medical personnel (MEMS) responded to the Pulaski County Jail to examine the suspect. Once examined by medical staff, this suspect was also processed into the Pulaski County Jail. All ten protestors were charged with disorderly conduct.

The library system notes this is an important step toward building a more equitable community by acknowledging the experiences and obstacles affecting people of color, particularly those in the African American community. "I can start by imagining how the public library can help us find ways to move our country's policies closer to her creeds,” wrote CALS Executive Director Nate Coulter in a statement released on June 3 following the killing of George Floyd by an officer in the Minneapolis Police Department. "Maybe the library can encourage more expressions of painful stories endured by people of color among us and encourage more attentive listening by those who lack such life experiences.” His full statement is available at CALS.org.
