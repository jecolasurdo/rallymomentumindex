Expand Previous Next The call for support went out, and Moose Jaw answered. Close to 100 vehicles and double that number in supporters descended on the Town'n'Country Mall parking lot on Saturday morning for a special Solidarity Rally in support of battling racism and equality everywhere. The event coincided with mass protests all over the United States and Canada happening that same time, including an expected crowd of over 200,000 for rallies in Washington, D.C. Like other events supporting the Black Lives Matter cause and protesting the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police in recent days, the rally was completely peaceful and supportive, something organizer Paulette Snell had called for from the beginning. And to say she was impressed with what she saw from those who came out is an understatement. "This is great, it really is great,” Snell said as car horns honked and rally supporters gathered at the Kinsmen Sportsplex at the close of the event. "What can I say? My heart is filled with happiness, I'm so encouraged that there is so much interest and that people are showing so much of the same awareness.” Supporters decorated their vehicles with signs and messages covering a variety of causes involving racism, discrimination and inequality, with Floyd's death only one of many sources of concern and frustration on display. First Nations subjects were especially prominent, given the ongoing issues Canadian society sees today. Snell herself delivered an impassioned 15-minute speech touching on her experiences and the many problems and difficulties those of non-white races see on a daily basis, and how they might be solved.

"We have to remind our community that it's hard work, but it's work that has to be done.” One of Snell's fellow organizers, Andrea Dyck, was also impressed with what she saw from her fellow Moose Javians. "Absolutely incredible,” she said. "We've seen it before in Moose Jaw, and we were hoping this would be the kind of turnout we'd be getting and we're very thankful. Everyone came to support the right cause and standing together in solidarity can make a difference.” Participants drove a procession route down Main Street before heading over to South Hill, and back up north on Ninth Avenue to the Sportsplex. The event concluded with the close to 200 participants taking a knee in memory of those fallen. Plans are starting to be put into place for a much larger march and rally once more COVID-19 restrictions have been lifted, with a possible date in July being considered. "We didn't have a permit this time because it was such short notice, but next time we'll have a walk down Main Street and then we'll end up in the park for a rally,” Snell said. "And we'll involve more people, people in power.” This has been shared 0 times 0 Shares Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on LinkedIn Forward by Email Print Share via Text Message This story was important to me or our community: view results > Not Very Slightly Fairly Very Extremely Comments Sort Oldest Newest Add Show We welcome your feedback and encourage you to share your thoughts.
