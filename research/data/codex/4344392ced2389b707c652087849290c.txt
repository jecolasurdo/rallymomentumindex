It was organized by university-age students who are home in Fort Bragg due to the Coronavirus. Protestors were asked to wear masks and respect social distancing protocols, and many stood in groups apart from each other, while others lined the sidewalk shoulder to shoulder. It was likely the largest gathering many people had seen in months. Many, many cars driving by the scene honked and slowed, showing their support for the protestors with shouts and cheers.

(Robin Epley – Advocate-News) Kate Becerra, one of the co-organizers, said the protest was formed "to stand in solidarity with the black community.” "Being from somewhere that doesn't have a large Black community, we have to stand up for the ones that are here,” she said. In fact, less than 2 percent of Fort Bragg's population — at the time of the last census in 2010 — identified as Black or African American. Anaya Brown, a protestor, said, "as a black person, it's nice to get our voices out there and open people's perspectives.” Fort Bragg interim police chief, John Naulty, was also in attendance, but seemed to be in more of a supportive role than a reactionary one. Nevertheless, when Naulty asked to make a statement on the bullhorn, organizers told him he would need to wait until any young, Black protestors had first been given the chance to speak. Both the Fort Bragg Police Department and the Mendocino County Sheriff's Office released similar statements of support in the last week. "On behalf of the Fort Bragg Police Department, we send our deepest condolences to the family and friends of George Floyd,” said a statement written by Naulty. "The actions taken by those individuals who violated the moral and ethical codes does not reflect what our department stands for.” Naulty also said he and his officers stand alongside the protestors, but asked that they exercised their rights peacefully and respect local businesses — mindful of the fact that many businesses in the community are still finically struggling due to shelter-in-place restrictions.

(Robin Epley – Advocate-News) At least one local business was busy during the protest, handing out free Gatorades, water and snacks to protestors. Kassandra and Zac Taylor, owners of Lunar Tide in downtown Fort Bragg, said they "stand with the cause,” and decorated the front windows of their shop with Black Lives Matter slogans, and the names of Black men and women who have been killed by the police in recent years. "If we don't stand for each other, what do we stand for?” Kassandra Taylor said. The Mendocino County Sheriff's Office also made a statement regarding the national protests on May 30. "Currently the Mendocino County Sheriff's Office is working hard on training in various fields including use of force,” the press release said. "We are working to partner with other law enforcement chiefs to ensure all peace officers within the county receive the training which is needed to deliver the best work product we possibly can.” The Sheriff's Office also made publicly-available all current standards, policies, practices, operating procedures and education and training materials.

(Robin Epley – Advocate-News) Avery Epperson, 14, was at Tuesday's protest with her mother, Terilynn Epperson, who said it was important for her to bring her daughter because: "It's history. It's important.” She said she was amazed to see so many people out in Fort Bragg, supporting their Black community. "A lot of times, we go through life complacent,” Epperson said. "As a black woman, it's important for (my daughter) to know she is not always going to be treated fairly, but there are people who will have your back when times are hard. This is a time when we need to support those who can't support themselves.” Avery, who was at her first protest ever, said she felt like, "people don't think it matters.” "I just want to show people Black lives matter,” she said. "It's the right thing to do.” Sign up for email newsletters Subscribe Follow Us Facebook Twitter RSS Most Popular Fort Bragg Police Log Mendocino state parks reopen City Council to discuss town name change Soroptimist International awards honors outstanding women Redwood Forest Foundation wants to save the trees Power shutoff to hit nearly all of Mendocino County Robin Epley | Editor Robin Epley is the editor of the Fort Bragg Advocate-News and the Mendocino Beacon.
