AMBER BAESLER, Journal Star AMBER BAESLER/Lincoln Journal Star LINCOLN, NEB - 07/14/2016 Pastor Janet Goodman Banks speaks before Black Lives DO Matter March participants on Thursday, July 14, 2016, in front of the state capitol building. AMBER BAESLER, Journal Star AMBER BAESLER/Lincoln Journal Star Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Sometimes hand in hand, sometimes with fists in the air, roughly 1,000 people attended the Black Lives DO Matter rally Thursday on the Capitol steps for the message: "We must unite. We must become involved. We must be the change.”Under a blistering sun, many waved homemade posters with phrases such as "White silence is violence” and "Black votes matter.”The two-hour rally that began at 6 p.m. was boisterous but peaceful. Early on, the crowd let out cheers and chants that could be heard far away.The confident shouts went quiet as several speakers stood before a podium."We are here to say we are weary, weeping, tired, frustrated and hurting,” said the Rev. Janet Goodman-Banks, an advocate and activist with The Women in the City Ministries. "We say, 'No more.'”Other speakers included Pastor Jessie Myles of No Greater Love Fellowship Church; Stephen Griffith of Interfaith Coalition of Nebraska; Jane Kleeb of Bold Nebraska and Lincoln Police Chief Jeff Bliemeister. Goodman-Banks began the evening with words of respect for law enforcement. One by one, she named the five officers killed in last week's shooting during a Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas.But she also said enough is enough; the African-American community will no longer stay hushed. They expect equal protection under the law, she said. Founder and president of Nebraskans Against Gun Violence, Amanda Gailey, spoke about how the gun industry and National Rifle Association contribute to "fear, ignorance, racism and hatred." "As long as we have an industry that every year sells $1.5 billion of guns and ammunition that disproportionately murders people of color, we need to say 'black lives do matter,'” Gailey said."Standing up to the gun industry starts in the building behind us,” she said, pointing to the Capitol.One message all speakers pushed was that Black Lives Matter supporters, especially blacks, must vote and voice their opinions to local government. Shannon Cameron, one of the event's seven organizers, who caller herself not a person of color said that if she didn't do something, then she was "silently condoning.” She thinks people may resist speaking out because of fear or because people don't know how to get involved. She said it's a big step to move past fear but a powerful step."We need them to vote. We need them to run for office,” Cameron said.Rally organizers estimated almost a thousand people attended.Organizers met with Bliemeister and other law enforcement on two occasions prior to Thursday's rally. Their welcoming attitudes and willingness to speak about concerns were appreciated and a "first step,” organizers said.Police stood back behind the crowd and monitored as the group marched from the Capitol to the Lancaster County Courthouse. Some police stopped to take photos with protesters holding signs. Bliemeister stood earnestly before the crowd with words of affirmation, saying "Law enforcement must be the example and not the exception.”Roaring applause followed."I'm excited to be a part of difficult but courageous conversations in order to build relationships with all of you so our agency can know your thoughts, your concerns and your expectations,” Bliemeister told the crowd. "You need to have a voice.”He reassured the Black Lives Matter community that Lincoln police offer support.Speakers said progress could only be achieved by bridging the divide between police and African-Americans. "We are not asking for this to be one-sided,” Goodman-Banks said. "We just want the right to be heard, to see our children grow up and see them pursue their dreams and goals in life.”Reach the writer at 402-473-7223 or lesparrago@journalstar.comOn Twitter @linds_esparrago View Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0 Tags Black Lives Matter Jeff Bliemeister Rally Janet Goodman-banks Community Police Organizer Amanda Gailey Get local news delivered to your inbox!
