Yesterday it was Michigan Avenue. Next will be State Street,” said Rev. Jackson. He vowed the protests will continue until demands are met, which include the removal of police Supt. Garry McCarthy and Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez. Rev. Jackson also demanded a special prosecutor to try Jason Van Dyke, the officer charged with murder in McDonald's death. Four people were arrested for traffic violations Saturday night during the protests, according to Chicago Police News Affairs. Several other groups also marched throughout the day Saturday. Dozens of people circled City Hall while carrying a casket and chanting "16 shots and a cover up," referring to the number of times Van Dyke shot McDonald. Protesters also gathered at 62nd and Cottage Grove calling for change at the police department. A prayer vigil for justice is scheduled to begin at 5:15 p.m. Monday at Progressive Baptist Church at 3658 S. Wentworth Ave. Participants will then march to Chicago Police Headquarters. Van Dyke is scheduled to return to court Monday for a bond hearing. 0 Weather ForecastChicago, IL Facebook Twitter Instagram Submit Tips for Investigations Newsletters Connect With Us Send Feedback WMAQ Employment Information Terms of Service Do Not Sell My Personal Information Privacy Policy – New Ad Choices Advertise With Us WMAQ Public Inspection File Copyright © 2020 NBC Universal Inc.
