About 40 organizers, activists and protesters from multiple organizations such as Black Lives Matter, Food Not Bombs and the Democratic Socialists of America gathered at around 9 p.m. Tuesday at Bubier Park in downtown Fort Lauderdale. They marched across the Andrews Avenue bridge to the gates of the jail on First Avenue and began singing, chanting, banging drums and makeshift percussion instruments and playing trombones, violins and other instruments.

"In Broward, it costs about $140 to incarcerate somebody at Broward County Main Jail and all those resources can be used to educate our people, provide more jobs, a lot of the reasons they're throwing people in here on misdemeanor charges.” According to a Sun Sentinel article from last year, "each person in the jail costs $50,000 or more over the course of a year, roughly $135 to $140 a day in Broward and Palm Beach counties,” to the tune of millions of dollars per year. Organizers say they have protests planned locally and nationwide through Sept. 9, including a march at McNair Park, 951 NW 27th Ave. in Pompano Beach on Sunday, Aug. 26 at 3 p.m. and a protest similar to the one at the Broward County Jail but at the Palm Beach County Detention Center, 3228 Gun Club Rd. in West Palm Beach though they did not yet have an exact date planned.
