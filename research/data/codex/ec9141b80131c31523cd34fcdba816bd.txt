About 40 organizers, activists and protesters from multiple organizations such as Black Lives Matter, Food Not Bombs and the Democratic Socialists of America gathered at around 9 p.m. Tuesday at Bubier Park in downtown Fort Lauderdale. They marched across the Andrews Avenue bridge to the gates of the jail on First Avenue and began singing, chanting, banging drums and makeshift percussion instruments and playing trombones, violins and other instruments. Minutes after they arrived at the gates of the jail, prisoners could be seen approaching the windows inside, dancing, waving and holding up peace signs with their fingers.
