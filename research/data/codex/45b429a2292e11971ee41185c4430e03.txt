"Every day I read another story how a different police department is taking another step to at least look like they are curbing the problem," said Cameron White, who was protesting in Downtown Miami Friday.

"A lot conversations I have been privy to are about police reform and also economic opportunities,” said Miami Mayor Francis Suarez.

We want to make sure that this momentum transits into policy." Earlier in the day, police said they were expecting a large protest and had advised certain businesses to close early. "The expected attendance is unknown, but there may be significant interruptions to vehicular and pedestrian traffic and business operations," the statement read. "We suggest that non-essential businesses close no later than 2 p.m. this afternoon."
