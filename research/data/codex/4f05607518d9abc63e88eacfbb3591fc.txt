KCPQ-TV SEATTLE ‚Äî A group of protesters gathered near Rainier Avenue South Saturday afternoon, slowing down traffic on Interstate 90 as they marched north toward the Juvenile Justice Center at 12th and Alder. The Seattle Police said that the march was permitted in advance and that marchers stuck to the prescribed route. Per SPD you can expect some periodic lane closures on Rainier Ave S in the area of I-90 for police activity until further notice. ‚Äî seattledot (@seattledot) January 10, 2015 Seattle police erected barriers near 12th Avenue and Pine Streets in anticipation of the protests, officials said.

January 10, 2015 at 1:46 PM Reply Janey Siegrist Well that's not a racist comment ...üòè January 10, 2015 at 1:53 PM Reply Tired of this junk Political correctness makes for denial and hypocrisy January 10, 2015 at 2:19 PM Reply VoiceOfReason None of this has anything to do with black lives. These punks need to get a life. Black lives do matter but if you commit a crime, disobey police orders and act threatening you can expect things to go poorly, regardless of what color you are. Be accountable for your actions. January 10, 2015 at 3:14 PM Reply Kit Interesting, the protesters are finally getting closer to the actual criminal element and not bugging shoppers downtown. If they march south, into the central area, then more of the troubled youth will hear their slogans. We're happy to see the SPD has made several arrests for the recent drive-by shootings. January 10, 2015 at 3:56 PM Reply Devin Thacker Maybe instead of impeding traffic on the streets and creating headaches for others. I would suggest to turning protesting powers towards volunteering in an outlying Seattle community at a food bank or community center of some sort. I think that would speak louder than marching the streets... January 10, 2015 at 11:58 PM Reply Kenneth Briggs so just use a few fire hoses from fire trucks and hose them all down black white or what ever . just get the road ways clear January 10, 2015 at 5:18 PM Reply Devin Thacker Not the 1960s. Maybe you could make a comment that would not give them fodder for their fire! January 11, 2015 at 12:04 AM Reply lambamile Yes, wow, agree with Devin. Please watch Selma‚Äìsentiments are reminiscent of Alabama in the 1960's. January 11, 2015 at 1:19 AM Reply Emily Sad that the only online news coverage of this event has NOTHING to do with the fact that black lives matter or anything this march was for and only highlights the fact that traffic was slowed. When innocent people died in our country, it was more than an inconvenience to their day! January 11, 2015 at 1:25 AM Reply Midgard Moderate At least it was a permitted march and they stuck to the permitted route. The ones where they are running amok are the ones violating others rights. January 11, 2015 at 10:05 AM Reply maureen What is more important? Snarled traffic or the unmentioned reason that people joined together to march? Are your investigative still truly so lacking that you were unable to find out why? This is poor journalism, but clearly catering to these hateful readers. WTF people, you really care more about traffic than human dignity? Get your values straight.
