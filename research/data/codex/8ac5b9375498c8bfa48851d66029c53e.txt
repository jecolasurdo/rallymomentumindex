Beauregard. The statue sits at the main entrance of City Park where North Carrollton and Esplanade avenues intersect. The vandalism was discovered over the weekend. Beauregard was a prominent general of the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War. The vandalism follows increased scrutiny surrounding several Confederate monuments around the New Orleans area. Last week, Mayor Mitch Landrieu called for the removal of statues and other symbols in the city that honor the confederacy. Landrieu said he is not trying to rewrite history, but the symbols and monuments don't align with the city's future. Landrieu said street names should also be a part of the discussion.
