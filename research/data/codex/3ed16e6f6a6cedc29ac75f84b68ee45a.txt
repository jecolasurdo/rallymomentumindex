But even with that in place, even with people wearing face coverings, mass outdoor gatherings like this could present risk to public health."And we do know there is a lot of evidence of the disproportionate impact that Covid-19 can have on the minority ethnic community."So the very people whose lives we say matter are the very lives that those people could be putting at risk.
