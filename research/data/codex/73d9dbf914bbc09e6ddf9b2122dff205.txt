Students protest regarding the Stephon Clark case near the Elk Grove Police Department headquarters. Photos by Lance Armstrong Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save About 50 students, mostly from Cosumnes Oaks High School, demonstrated in Elk Grove last week to protest two recent law enforcement investigations that cleared the Sacramento police officers who fatally shot Stephon Clark last year. They left their campus during a school day.Clark was shot by Sacramento police in the Meadowview neighborhood of south Sacramento during the early morning of March 18, 2018. The police arrived in that area in response to a 911 call of a man breaking car windows, and they later began pursuing the suspect who was evading them.The officers ultimately shot Clark, who was holding a cell phone that the officers claimed they thought was a gun during a confrontation in his grandmother's backyard. In her March 2 report, Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert announced that her office would not pursue criminal charges against the officers who killed Clark.Three days later, California Attorney General Xavier Becerra announced that following an independent review by the Department of Justice, he also would not file criminal charges against the officers.These announcements resulted in various protests, including a protest in East Sacramento, where 84 people were arrested, and a march to the state Capitol by a few hundred Sacramento high school students and activists. Many believed that Clark, an African American, was a victim of racial profiling. The Cosumnes High School students' March 7 protest began at the Shell gas station near the Elk Grove Auto Mall at 11:30 a.m., and later moved to a sidewalk near the Elk Grove police station.Mia Moreno, a 15-year-old Cosumnes Oaks student, said that students learned about the school walk out and protest through social media sites and on her campus.She explained why she decided to join in the protest."I just wanted to stand up for what's right,” Moreno said. "It's not right what they did and what happened, and then they just want to drop all the charges.”Rio Cazadero High School student Danielle Scales referred to the student-led protest's organizers as "some powerful students within the Cosumnes Oaks (High) community.”Scales stressed that it was important to the students to participate in the protest."It's important for us to be here today, because as we see in the killing of Stephon Clark, the police was not charged for their murders,” she said. "We just see that as a continuing issue in this country."It's not talked about in our schools. We are not supported, so we felt that we needed to speak our voices and let the community hear us.”Scales added that she feels that police officers need better training. "There's not only a problem with the justice system, but there's a problem with the police departments all over America, and how they train their (officers) and just how they police the communities, period,” she said.Cosumnes Oaks student Hezekiah Brazelton, 16, said that he was upset that Clark was shot while holding a cell phone."They think everything is a gun, like (the police) stop you, you reach in your pocket, that's a gun,” he said. "I don't get it. They just need to stop whatever they're doing.”Cosumnes Oaks student Daevon Kennedy was also critical of the officers' belief that Clark had a gun."There's no way to justify (the shooting),” he said. "It's stupid that they think a cell phone looks like a gun. I'm going to keep on speaking my mind about how I feel and that's how it's going to be, and that's not going to change."I'm going to spread the word and help more people get involved with the situation, because this has to stop.”Isabelle Fama, 17, also expressed disappointment that no criminal charges will be made against the officers who shot Clark.She additionally stated that it is important to her to join like-minded people on the issue of Clark."I can't really make a difference by myself,” she said.Another Cosumnes High student, 16-year-old Rayvin Smithross, said that people of color live in fear of the police. "Within the blink of the eye, there's one taken after another, after another,” she said. "These are our brothers, our sisters, dads, grandparents, uncles, nephews, and we've got to live in this society today knowing and being scared.”Elk Grove Unified spokesperson Xanthi Pinkerton said that the district has been monitoring events related to the DA's announcement regarding the Clark case.She said that student safety is a priority in regard to any planned school walk-out or peaceful protest."The district has policies and procedures in place to support and protect students in situations that relate to freedom of speech, civic engagement and controversial issues where we can encourage calm and civil discourse, provide appropriate supervision and discourage unsafe or disruptive behavior,” Pinkerton said.
