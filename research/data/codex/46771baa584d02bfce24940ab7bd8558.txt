Author: Bruce Kopp Published: 9:02 PM EDT September 24, 2016 Updated: 12:46 AM EDT September 28, 2016 INDIANAPOLIS (WTHR) - Dozens of marchers took to the streets downtown Saturday to protest the latest police shootings across America. "Just letting the individuals out in Charlotte and Tulsa know we stand with them," said Dominic Dorsey. He's the head of a group called "Don't Sleep," which helped organize the local march. They carried a banner declaring "Black Lives Matter" and chanted messages to protest what they see as police misconduct connected to the string of fatal shootings across the country. "And if we don't fight for and stand up for things that we believe are not positive, then we're really doing ourselves a disservice," Hope Artis said. "All lives matter, but this in particular is about fighting police brutality," added Astria Long. "I'm appreciative that we have so many people, so many allies out here trying to make sure that individuals know that Black Lives Matter," Dorsey said. "That they're not sitting here supporting All Lives Matter and the rhetoric leaving out Black Lives, but it's still heartbreaking that we have to do it at all. At any moment, it could be one of my family members, it could even be me. I'm a father, I'm a husband. I don't want to be a hashtag." Organizers say they've collected 3,000 signatures on a petition to improve training, transparency engagement and accountability of local law enforcement to prevent officer-involved fatalities here at home. The petition will be delivered to the governor, the mayor of Indianapolis and City-County Council leaders to push for more reform.
