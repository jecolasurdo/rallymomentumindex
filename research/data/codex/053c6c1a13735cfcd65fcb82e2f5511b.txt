MARK GORMUS/TIMES-DISPATCH Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Demonstration focuses on gentrification, evictions and the quality of black lives By WAYNE EPPS JR. and ALI SULLIVAN Richmond Times-Dispatch Jun 11, 2020 Jun 11, 2020 51 Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email 1 of 3 Demonstrators gathered Thursday near the Carytown Kroger on West Cary Street. MARK GORMUS/TIMES-DISPATCH Protesters, on bicycles, on foot and in cars, head down West Cary Street Thursday. MARK GORMUS/TIMES-DISPATCH Protest at Carytown Kroger on W. Cary Street Thurs. June 11, 2020. MARK GORMUS/TIMES-DISPATCH Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save As Omari Al-Qadaffi, a local organizer, spoke to more than 100 people Thursday evening in Richmond, he implored that it's not simply that "black lives matter.” It's that the "quality of black lives” matters, too.That was the theme of the gathering in a parking lot near the Kroger on West Cary Street. Michaela Hatton, a local organizer and recent graduate of Virginia Commonwealth University, organized the protest, which came on the 14th day of demonstrations in Richmond.First sparked by the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis , protests nationwide and in Richmond have pivoted toward different inequities underlying structural racism in the United States.Protesters in Richmond have toppled statues of Christopher Columbus and Jefferson Davis.Thursday's focus: gentrification and evictions.Gentrification occurs as development drives up a neighborhood's housing costs, often displacing longtime residents while altering a neighborhood's historic racial or ethnic character.Hatton's goal with Thursday's protest was to not focus just on police brutality — their fight is against more than that, she said."Housing discrimination and gentrification in the city is a big, big issue that I don't think many people talk about or know about,” Hatton said.Richmond is among the most gentrified cities in the state, according to a 2019 report from the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. The report — which used census tract data to measure socioeconomic changes — found that, in four Richmond census tracts, the black population fell 40% from 1990 to 2010. In that same period, the white population increased 30%.According to data from the Partnership for Housing Affordability, released early this year, median rent prices in the Richmond region rose by an average of 20% in the past decade. Also, in 2016, according to a Princeton University Eviction Lab report published in The New York Times, Richmond had the second-highest eviction rate in the country, behind just North Charleston, S.C."We'd never want to limit the discussion of abuse, oppression, and racism to just the sensationalized physical deaths that we see on TV,” said Al-Qadaffi, a housing organizer for the Legal Aid Justice Center. "We want to keep in mind the financial and social deaths that black people are disproportionately subjected to.”Some of the issues have been exacerbated by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. A statewide moratorium on evictions went into effect Monday and is scheduled to last through June 28.Among the policies Al-Qadaffi called for were the cancellation of rent and a continuation of the moratorium on evictions until the pandemic is over."What good is it to defend a life if we turn a blind eye to that life that is trapped in misery and hopelessness in the city of Richmond?” Al-Qadaffi asked.Al-Qadaffi was one of three speakers in addition to Hatton who spoke to the crowd for about 30 minutes Thursday, as heavy rain began toward the end."Justice doesn't stop for a little rain,” Hatton said.The group planned to march to the Windsor Farms neighborhood and end at the Rumors of War statue at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts.Another of Thursday's speakers, Allan-Charles Chipman, a City Council candidate in the 6th District, told the group that they not only must tear down the monuments. They must tear down mindsets, too, he said.The state of housing in the city is not an issue that has yet received as much attention, but Thursday's protest was meant to change that."I thought that it'd be a really great idea that we could come here, talk about that, learn about next steps, so that we can combat and resist this trend that's going on,” Hatton said. asullivan@timesdispatch.com wepps@timesdispatch.com (804) 649-6442 Twitter: @wayneeppsjr Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save More information Support local journalism.

Jun 12, 2020 4:04pm I wonder if the Richmond Police are to be defunded why they should bother investigating the 5 shootings overnight ? They would likely be charged with brutalizing the perps if they made an arrest. Report Add Reply BOBBY QUISENBERRY Jun 12, 2020 6:11pm Gee, I thought the demonstrations were supposed to be over an innocent Black man killed by a policeman! Now it is full blown everything else? I certainly didn't agree with that Black man being killed and how it happened but that Black man was no saint either. Wasn't he a felon who spend time in prison (5 years if I am not mistaken), had also stolen a gun, was using illicit drugs, was staring in porno films, and was passing counterfeit money just right before the police confrontation. Hadn't the policeman who killed him, worked together with him as private security and already knew him. What did the police run on him and know before the confrontation. Did they need to be afraid of him? I don't defend the police killing him but he was no credit to the Black race. If these demonstrations were over protests of that killing, what is all the vandalizing, arson, looting and general lawlessness and all disrespect for authority over? If the the police had just sort of disappeared during these protests don't you even wonder what the results would have been like? These cities would have imploded and it would have been a descent into h--l! I can have no respect for the people involved in these demonstrations. They were just taking opportunity to do what they do, vandalizing, arson, looting, disrespecting authority and just generally expressing their rage at anything and everything and everyone deserving or not! Report Add Reply Drake D Butler Jun 12, 2020 7:24pm Too many denials, Bobby. Your flying your racist flag again."that Black man was no saint either”" I don't defend the police killing him but he was no credit to the Black race”So, Bobby thinks he didn't deserve to die, but the African American does deserve to have his name smeared through the mud so you should feel less sympathetic towards the movement that is trying to stop unarmed black men from being murdered by cops.

Report Add Reply Denae Lonzer Jun 12, 2020 10:04am This is brilliant, a sit down is needed, but action must be the goal. However, as I watch footage on facebook from last night in the West End, I can only imagine why there is no story about RPD catching KKK members with guns, bulletproof vests and zip ties, trying to agitate protestors. Where is that story? Report Add Reply Bob Harrison Jun 12, 2020 3:36pm The press is gun-shy of both Trump and his CULT followers... Oh... And for good reason... These people are f**king crazy... ~~~ Bob Report Add Reply Denae Lonzer Jun 12, 2020 6:19pm Absolutely Bob. They've always been that way. Growing up on propaganda, and finding out it was definitely propaganda, will do that. Report Add Reply Derek Woolwine Jun 12, 2020 9:57am Home ownership, and building equity and wealth, is a big piece of the puzzle for all lower income citizens - maybe the biggest after quality education and facilities. It is too bad Richmond missed the mark with Navy Hill, but it needs to find a way to create owner occupied neighborhoods and communities to build a sense of togetherness and to build equity individually and as a city. Report Add Reply Derek McCown Jun 12, 2020 9:56am "Gentrification occurs as development drives up a neighborhood's housing costs, often displacing longtime residents while altering a neighborhood's historic racial or ethnic character."So for those that are against gentrification are against changing a neighborhood's racial or ethnic character? White neighborhoods stay white; black neighborhoods stay black; latino neighborhoods stay latino?It seems odd that a movement that seeks inclusiveness also seeks to keep neighborhoods segregated.

Report Add Reply Bob Harrison Jun 12, 2020 8:23am Let's do a little review of not only Richmond but every city in America... In the 60's and 70's cities experience WHITE FLIGHT leaving the cities with reduced tax bases and as a result cities experience decline, lower real estate values and abandoned properties... Throw in the War on Crime (War on Black Men) the cities had their problems... Black people (Democrats) were left to try to deal with all of those issues and where as it has been a slog most cities have pulled themselves out of the hole that WHITE FLIGHT left in their wakes... It's taken decades but black Democrats have turned cities around and now they have become desirable to white people who are gobbling up inner city real estate driving values up, up, up... That has occurred here in Richmond... Check out Manchester or Church Hill or Jackson Ward where that reality is evident... Bottom line??? Black Democrats have done such a good job that it is now hurting many black people who can no longer afford to live here... This is a universal problem in most cities in America and it needs to be addressed as part of an overall plan to make cities centers for a diverse population... End of ***History of the American City*** 001 (remedial, no credit)... ~~~ Bob Report Add Reply TRACY PETERS Jun 12, 2020 9:02am ~~~ Bob .... your "little review", unveiled a truth you don't normally like to admit to ...... it was the money that left with the White Man's Flight from big cities, that you are the maddest about ... not the White's Leaving.Now you know why the Democrats use you, and yours ..... promises of more White's Money back into the inner cities, while letting the culture of brother killing brothers, taking a back seat to your hate for the police, and maybe even a few folks you disagree with.Even animals know you do not bite the hand of those who you seem to depend on, and hate at the same time.You will not leave this world, noted for your desire for unity .... just revenge for a war none of us had a hand in. Period. ~~~Tracy Report Add Reply Bob Harrison Jun 12, 2020 9:50am I'm not mad about any of this, Checker Eater... I am reporting on a phenomena that most of us Baby Boomers witnessed... I also am dispelling the absolute LIES that people like you can't get enough of about black/Democratic leadership in our cities today that make cities attractive to white people... Guess these black Democrats have done a pretty good job with what was left after WHITE FLIGHT... Uh huh??? ~~~ Bob Report Add Reply Craigmont McGill Jun 12, 2020 9:08am sidewalk bob - white flight, as you call it - started in Richmond well before the 1960s. Report Add Reply Bob Harrison Jun 12, 2020 9:46am Provide your sources, McG... Remember that I capitalized WHITE FLIGHT because it is a term that people who study urban planning use about a specific event and not one here and one there... ~~~ Bob Report Add Reply Derek Woolwine Jun 12, 2020 10:08am But mostly due to the stoppage of annexation by Richmond city of surrounding counties. Best comparison around is Richmond vs Charlotte/Mecklenburg, Richmond discontinued but Charlotte did not. But has is there much difference in the life of minorities there vs here now because of that difference - that I don't know. Report Add Reply Bob Harrison Jun 12, 2020 12:31pm Charlotte is a city and also part of Meckenburg Co... Much different but the same thing is going on there... Central Ave. used to be black and now it is YUPPIE-ville pretty much from down town to the old mall... Same on East Side around the near Johnson C. Smith University...~~~ Bob Report William Howard Jun 12, 2020 9:55am Bob the riots in Richmond and the other cities is a big incentive to move out. Who wants to reside in a high crime area and have your property destroyed. Look at Chicago who would want to reside in that thug invested city with all the violence. I'm glad I don't reside in downtown Richmond having to face these so-called protesters who at night turn into animals looking for prey! Report Add Reply Drake D Butler Jun 12, 2020 10:26am Eichmond has recovered from any disturbances. The housing market is as strong as ever. Property values continue up.All the other hundreds of other cities from sea to shining sea that had protests are also doing fine.

Stay out with the other rednecks... ~~~ Bob Report Derek Woolwine Jun 12, 2020 10:02am I am not sure it was because Richmond did such a good job people wanted to come back, look at the poor public infrastructure all over town (what city Richmond's size doesn't even have a coliseum - the largest in Richmond now is the Siegel Center). It was because the value dropped so much it became attractive to buy in there again. There is plenty of city owned property that can be used for lower income home ownership, or they can sell surplus and put that toward other property that can be used to build new housing and build equity for lower income citizens - not to mention creating more of a "neighborhood" and less transient "complexes".

Report Add Reply Bob Harrison Jun 12, 2020 3:39pm They must be doing something right, Derek... Jackson Ward, Manchester and Church Hill are all HOT!!! ~~~ Bob Report Add Reply steve edmondson Jun 14, 2020 7:59am Uhm, those White people gobble it up because it's cheap and there is a profit motive. If all was well as you pretend, the pricing would be too high to begin with. Much of the city is a wreck and most schools are failing. "Black democrats have done such a good job"? If you say so. Gentrification is overall good for an old city like RVA. Better than to watch these old buildings crumble. Maybe the city could come up with a plan to not raise taxes on those in the rebuilt areas but still have an older home. If they sell out for huge profit, the taxes then could be paid. Try to keep it fair. But trying to stop people from fixing up older places because they are not Black seems a bit racist as well.. No? Report Add Reply RICK FISK Jun 12, 2020 7:33am Here is a funny little tidbit...... you know the kente cloth that nanc and her minions wore the other day???In exchange for guns and other European goods, the Ashanti sold gold and slaves, usually either captured in war or accepted as tribute from conquered peoples.
