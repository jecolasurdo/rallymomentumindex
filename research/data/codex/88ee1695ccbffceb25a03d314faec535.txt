WatchWorkforce AllianceYale EventsYMCAYouth ContinuumSubscribe to the NHI Newsletter Protesters Stop Traffic To Send Cop-Misconduct Messageby Sam Gurwitt | Oct 31, 2019 8:00 am (10) Comments | Commenting has been closed | E-mail the AuthorPosted to: Hamden, Legal Writes Protesters rounded the bend into the Hamden Government Center Wednesday evening, raising their arms into the lightly drizzling air and facing a police car with its lights flashing."Hands up!” they shouted. "Don't shoot!”They were en route, in the southbound lane of Dixwell Avenue, to Hamden Mayor Curt Leng's office to deliver a letter calling on him to demand the termination of Hamden Police Officer Devin Eaton.Last week, Eaton was arrested on one felony charge and two misdemeanor charges filed by the state's attorney after he shot at an unarmed couple on Argyle Street in New Haven's Newhallville neighborhood on April 16 at 4:32 a.m. on suspicion (later dispelled) of having committed an armed robbery. Eaton fired 13 shots at the car, sending Stephanie Washington to the hospital. A Yale officer on the scene, Terrance Pollock, fired another three.Eaton was put on unpaid administrative leave last Monday, and Hamden Acting Police Chief John Cappiello announced that his department would complete its internal investigation within 30 days. After that point, Cappiello said, he will make a recommendation to the town's Police Commission regarding Eaton's discipline. Only the Police Commission in Hamden has the power to fire an officer.Wednesday's protesters said they want the termination to happen now.The protest began with speeches on the steps of Hamden's historic town hall."I follow a Christ who was on the side of those who were marginalized and oppressed,” said Spring Glen Church Rev. Jack Perkins Davidson. "I follow a Christ who was put to death by state-sanctioned violence.”"I'm here to demand the police commission terminate Devin Eaton and follow their own police union contract process within the timeline provided,” said activist Rhonda Caldwell, who is also running for Hamden's Legislative Council on the Working Families Party ticket in the Nov. 5 general election. Protesters (including Rhonda Caldwell, in foreground of photo, and Kerry Ellington) cited a clause in the police union's contract with the town that states that the Police Commission must hold a hearing within 10 working days after an officer is put on unpaid administrative leave.According to the union contract, an officer may be put on unpaid administrative leave if the officer has been arrested for felony charges. "If an officer is put on administrative leave without pay under this section,” the contract reads, "he shall have a hearing before the Police Commission within ten (10) working days of the date of the unpaid leave. The ten (10) day requirement can be waived by the mutual consent of the parties, provided that a hearing shall commence within sixty days (60) of the date of the unpaid leave.”"As per police union contract,” said protester and Southern Connecticut State University Professor Cassi Meyerhoffer, "a hearing must be held within 10 working days of the state's decision to stop paying an officer. That day is Monday, November 4th.”Cappiello told the Independent that this 10-day period does not actually have to do with the discipline that he may bring against Eaton as a result of the shooting. That hearing is intended to give an officer who has been placed on unpaid administrative leave a chance to appeal that unpaid leave, he said. The hearing is "regarding that non-paid status. It's not the discipline. It's the non-paid status.”Cappiello said that the department and Eaton have not made an agreement regarding the hearing. If they do not come to an agreement, the hearing will need to take place by Monday, though it will address only the issue of Eaton's unpaid leave. Hamden Police Commission Chair Michael Iezzi told the Independent that the commission will comply with the union contract and that if need be, it will call an emergency meeting.Protesters said they will give the town until Wednesday Nov. 6 to hold the hearing. At that point, they said, they will go to Leng's house to protest if no hearing has been held."We apologize in advance for the ruckus we're going to make, but this is serious,” said Caldwell. "This is life or death.”Internal Affairs Investigation After a few speeches, People Against Police Brutality Organizer Kerry Ellington held up a megaphone and told the crowd that she and whoever wanted to join would be marching in the street to the mayor's office.Once a few cars and trucks had gone by, she walked into the road and told everyone to link arms. Together, they marched down the southbound lane of Dixwell Avenue as rush-hour traffic streamed past in the opposite lane. "Ain't no power like the power of the people cause the power of the people don't stop!” they yelled as they passed the police department, a line of cars lined up behind them.Once they came abreast the Miller Memorial Library parking lot, a police car with its lights on pulled up behind them, trailing them. Two pulled up in front. "How many bullets? 16!” they shouted, referring to how many times Eaton and Yale's Pollock fired at the two unarmed people inside the car in the April incident.Once they arrived at Hamden Government Center, protesters filed up the stairs and into the hall outside the mayor's office.It was around 6:15, and the office door was locked. (Leng told the Independent that he was not in the office at the time.) Meyerhoffer (pictured) read the letter, which had been written by residents. Laurie Sweet later slipped it under the mayor's office door."You cannot fire Devin Eaton, but you have the power to publicly call upon the Hamden Police Commission to fire him,” the letter read. "We are asking you to use that power now.”When protesters entered his office during an April protest, Leng said, "I have seen enough to recommend termination.” He added that he needed to see what would happen with the state and local investigations."Hamden's Police Chief now has up until November 20th to review the report being completed by the Department's Ethics and Integrity Unit and issue disciplinary charges,” Leng wrote Wednesday evening in a statement. "I refer further questions on the timeline specifics and report progress to Chief Cappiello ... The State took this incident very seriously and after completing their 6-month investigation, they brought criminal charges. I trust the Police Chief and Police Commission will review this matter with the same level of seriousness, which it deserves, and ensure the outlined process is handled properly.”Waiting is not necessary, protesters wrote in the letter: "We heard, from you and the Commission, that the Board was waiting for the results of the state's attorney's investigation. We then heard, from you and the Commission, that the Commission was waiting for the results of a different 'investigation' conducted by an outside consultant — an unnecessary step that is not required by town law or by the town's collective bargaining agreement with police employees.” After the shooting, protesters demanded that the town open in independent investigation into the incident. The town announced that it was opening an internal affairs investigation with the assistance of an outside consultant.According to Cappiello, the town began the investigation, but the town and the state's attorney came to an agreement that the town's investigation would not interfere with the state's. That meant that the town could not interview certain witnesses, including Eaton, until after the state had concluded its investigation.The internal affairs investigation will determine whether Eaton violated department rules. Cappiello told the Independent that the department and the Hamden Police Union came to an agreement that the town must complete its investigation within 30 days of the results of the state's attorney's investigation. That means Cappiello has until Nov. 20 to finish the investigation and bring disciplinary charges, if he chooses to do so, against Eaton. The union contract states that once the chief brings charges against an officer, the police commission must hold a hearing no sooner than one week, and no later than 30 days after the introduction of charges.Protesters said that now that the state's attorney's investigation is over, and Eaton has been criminally charged with assault, the internal investigation is no longer necessary. "The most powerful law enforcement officer in the New Haven judicial district, State's Attorney Patrick Griffin, believes he has just cause to bring forward felony and misdemeanor charges,” said Melvin Medina (pictured), the public policy and advocacy director at the Connecticut ACLU. "That is enough to fire Devin Eaton.”Some protesters accused the town and the department of using the investigation to stall."I'm not stalling,” said Cappiello. He said he is working hard to follow all the rules "because I need to support my case... The Police Commission needs to have evidence given to them.”It's like a trial, he said. He explained that if he does not come before the police commission with a thorough internal investigation into how Eaton violated department policy, if that is his determination, then he won't be able to present the evidence the commission needs to uphold his disciplinary sentence.Protesters also said that the commission has refused to hear their complaints against Eaton. In May, protesters shut down a commission meeting. Iezzi said that he had been "more than willing” to hear the complaints of community members. At the beginning of the meeting, he said that he was going to get through the business the commission needed to deal with and then open up the floor to public comments. "However, our meeting was disrupted and we were unable to complete it,” he said.The commission has until Monday to hold a hearing on Eaton's unpaid leave, if he and the department do not agree to the 60-day extension. If the hearing does not take place, Leng may find protesters outside his house on Wednesday.It may be personal to go to the mayor's house, said Ellington, but "it's been personal since they shot 16 bullets into the car of a young black couple ... It's public and personal.” Tags: Devin Eaton, protest, Rhonda Caldwell, John Cappiello, Hamden Police Department, termination, internal affairs investigation Your Email: Subject: Message: Sent: Jun 19, 2020 1:49 pmPlease enter the word you see in the image below: submit ×Share this story with others.Post a CommentCommenting has closed for this entryCommentsposted by: Fitzy14 on October 31, 2019 8:38amAre the protesters aware that "hands up dont shoot” was a lie? Once again, this ignorant mob wants to throw out due process and hand out their own "justice”. Seems like something the ACLU and someone who works for legal aid would be against.posted by: DwightAndHowe on October 31, 2019 8:48amI thought "Hands up, Don't shoot” was actually never uttered by the victim. Can someone corroborate?posted by: Noteworthy on October 31, 2019 10:42amMyths and Mob Notes:1. Hands up, don't shoot is a lie perpetuated by Black Lives Matter and people like Kerry Ellington who traffic is bullying, disparagement and violations of due process.2. Mob: Go home. If I'd been stuck behind this mob, they'd hear nothing but a very loud horn. Taking over streets on a rainy night is ignorant and selfish.3. Being charged by the state's attorney means nothing. You're accused. That's it and you still have the presumption of innocence. You lose no rights until a jury of your peers says otherwise in a court of law. So, suggesting that the charge alone is enough to fire somebody without departmental and union due process is ignorant and nothing more than a bully tactic.posted by: Noteworthy on October 31, 2019 10:50amBiblical Notes: Spring Glen Church Rev. Jack Perkins Davidson should read what Scripture says about the death and life of Jesus. and stop co-opting it for his own purposes and aggrandizement. The life of Christ was far more than that centered around social justice as defined by today's ministerial crowd and certainly His death had nothing to do with "state sanctioned violence.” It was both God's plan as the sacrificial lamb for the sins of the world, as a way of salvation - but ironically, the state bowed to the pressure of the Church leaders at that time who also ironically, fanned and inflamed the demands of the crowd.posted by: Mike Melanson on October 31, 2019 11:24am"Hands up, don't shoot” was not something uttered by the victim, no - it's a slogan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hands_up,_don't_shootNoteworthy, you take issue with "Hands up, don't shoot” but then suddenly bring "due process” into it, as if that means something special in terms of firing or not. An officer is an employee of the state and serves the people. This particular officer did not act according to many of the guidelines in place by the Hamden police department - as pointed out in another Independent article: https://www.newhavenindependent.org/index.php/archives/entry/velleca_cops/Just like any other employee, he can be fired for things like not following guidelines. "Due process” has to do with being legally charged with a crime, not with keeping a job.posted by: Noteworthy on October 31, 2019 11:58amThe union contract has a due process procedure for termination and lesser punishments - including suspension with and without pay. There is a very specific well defined process. That's what I mean by due process - there is another set of rules that govern due process in a criminal and civil court. That's the legal version. The Town of Hamden is bound by the union contract. The rush to judgment, the demands of the mob should be ignored.posted by: Dennis Serf on October 31, 2019 12:05pmI would like to see the protesters join me in calling on the city to have a standing reward of $10,000 for information leading to the arrest/conviction of any person who shoots someone in New Haven. For decades New York City has had a program that offers a $10,000 reward in instances where a police officer has been shot; it's call the Cop Shot Reward.New Haven should have a similar program and it should be applied to ANYONE who has been shot in New Haven.We need to send a message: If you shoot someone in New Haven we will post a $10,000 reward to find you.#NotInNewHavenDennis Serfilippi https://www.ournewhaven.org/platformposted by: 1644 on October 31, 2019 12:10pm1. In the present case, the video reveals that Witherspoon was exiting his car and raising both hands when the Hamden cop opened fire. 2. In the Ferguson case, there was no video, only some audio. Eye-witness testimony was conflicting. The Obama Justice Department did say, "There is no witness who has stated that Brown had his hands up in surrender whose statement is otherwise consistent with the physical evidence” and "our investigation did not reveal any eyewitness who stated that Brown said 'don't shoot'.” 3. The autopsy in Ferguson conclusively showed that Brown was not, as some claimed, shot in the back. 4. NHLAA needs to decide where it wants to deploy its resources. Current police use of force and accountability is rooted in law. As a law firm, NHLAA could use its attorneys to lobby the legislature and police commission to shift more risk from the public to police, and to make it easier to fire police officers. Such efforts met with some success in California.posted by: New Haven Urbanism on October 31, 2019 12:46pm1644,Thank you for your level-headed comments.For me, it is also important to note that the video shows both of Witherspoon's hands being raised above the car door and visible AFTER his eyes are raised up above the top of the car door and he is able to see the police officer. This fact is what makes judging the officer difficult for me. If both of Witherspoon's hands had been raised up above the car door and visible BEFORE he raised his head above the car (and Witherspoon could not see the officer), then the issue would be much easier to judge. I'd feel much more comfortable condemning the officer's actions as being unreasonable. In either situation, the outcome is terrible, but the order in which both hands were visible and Witherspoon could see the officer seems relevant when judging the officer's actions.posted by: thecove on November 4, 2019 9:38amKerry Ellington is an embarrassment to the cause.
