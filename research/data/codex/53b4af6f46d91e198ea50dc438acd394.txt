LOUIS • Hundreds of protesters marched in the Shaw neighborhood Sunday to mark the third anniversary of the death of VonDerrit Myers. At one point, protesters moved street barricades that were set up for the Shaw Art Fair. The fair was over, but artists' tents and stages were still set up.Many held "Black Lives Matter" signs or carried candles. At least one person was holding a "Police Lives Murder" sign.Alderman Stephen Conway directed traffic at the intersection of Klemm Avenue and Shaw Boulevard when protesters first began to gather at about 6 p.m., as he has during previous protests in the area. Protesters briefly marched eastbound along Flora Avenue toward Grand before circling back to the intersection. Someone announced at about 8:45 p.m. that the "organized action," had ended, but several dozen people still gathered in the area. Separate investigations by police and the circuit attorney's office concluded that Myers fired shots at a police officer before the officer returned fire.Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce's office cleared former officer Jason Flanery of criminal wrongdoing in the fatal shooting of Myers on Oct. 8, 2014. Officials said evidence supported Flanery's claim that Myers fired shots at him during a confrontation while Flanery was working an off-duty secondary job for a private security company.The shots Myers fired at Flanery missed, authorities said, at least one striking a car behind him and others landing in a dirt hill where Flanery took cover.The killing of Myers ignited sometimes-violent reactions in the Shaw neighborhood where it happened and led to weeks of demonstrations. Flanery abruptly resigned from the police department in January 2016 after he was charged with DWI in a different incident. He was driving his police car at the time and struck a parked car. +6 VonDerrit D. Myers Jr. in a police photo from his arrest in a June 2014 weapons and fleeing case.
