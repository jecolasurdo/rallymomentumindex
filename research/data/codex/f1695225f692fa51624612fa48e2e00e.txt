Messenger photo by Larry Di Giovanni Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Note: This story appears in the Friday, June 1 newspaper on Page A1.NELSONVILLE — Following a lengthy investigation into alleged derogatory social media posts, Nelsonville City Council unanimously voted to fire police officer Joshua Braglin at a meeting Wednesday evening.The vote came as protesters attended the meeting to call for Braglin's firing.Braglin had been on leave and under city investigation for reportedly posting numerous controversial Facebook statuses, many of them racial in nature and directed at Hocking College Interim Police Chief Tiffany Tims, who is African American.Tims submitted an official complaint against Braglin last year and more recently appeared at a news conference with NAACP Dayton Unit President Derrick L. Foward. Tims and Foward announced last week their intention to file a complaint with the U.S. Justice Department's Southern District of Ohio.Other posts from Braglin appeared to be directed at Hocking College Betty Young, who also complained to city officials last year about the officer's social media conduct.Tim Brunicardi, a Hocking College spokesman, said Braglin's firing was a city decision and that "it would not be appropriate for Hocking College to make an official comment.”Though the city investigation began last November, the posts in question continued through January of this year.That month during an executive session, council members viewed 21 pages worth of screenshots purporting to show Braglin's social media posts and some private messages. While council members supported firing Braglin, the Nelsonville Charter form of government requires an act of the city manager to terminate a police officer.As the investigation became public, City Manager Charles Barga repeatedly told The Messenger he personally believed Braglin should be fired but would not yet do so because of potential litigation concerns. In addition, Barga had received recommendation from a city-paid employment attorney that Braglin receive a disability-related separation agreement.Later, six of the seven members of council expressed profound opposition to that offer in a joint statement released May 17, which argued that Braglin should be terminated and that the city cannot be seen as tolerating racism, misogyny and bigotry.Among the allegations city officials knew of regarding Braglin's conduct included: screenshots of a post referencing Tims and a room "filled with bananas”; Braglin being allegedly heard by two other police officers saying he would "beat that (expletive) to death with a banana” before Tims could become the college's permanent police chief; and a complaint from Tims that other Hocking College officers had reportedly observed Braglin being intoxicated on the job.While both the city and the Nelsonville Police Department have social media policies, Barga had at times noted that Braglin's posts were made during his own time outside of the workplace. He also said as late as last week that a social media policy is difficult to enforce."As for the social media policy, the question is 'what is egregious enough?'” Barga previously told The Messenger. "People interpret that phrase differently along with the First Amendment. This is why we are using a labor attorney to avoid litigation and get it correct.”Barga gave his formal recommendation to council on Wednesday that Braglin be terminated. Barga read a letter into the record stating that the Nelsonville Police Department's police prohibits employees from using social media "so as to tarnish the office's reputation ... (or) any online activity that has the effect of diminishing the public's trust and/or confidence in this office.”The policy allows for punishment ranging from oral reprimand "to suspension and/or termination depending on the severity of the violation.” Barga stated at Wednesday's meeting that following pre-disciplinary hearings involving Braglin on April 2 and again on May 29, and following a written report from outside investigator Ted Jones, he had decided to recommend termination, effective immediately.Actions preceding Wednesday's decision were quite an ordeal in themselves, as the city rearranged its agenda to the dismay of about 40 protesters who attended the meeting and brought signs denouncing racism. They represented groups including the Athens Chapter of the International Socialist Organization (ISO) and Showing up for Racial Justice in Southeast Ohio (SURJ).Hoping to speak near the beginning of the meeting, many protesters were delayed from doing so as council moved up an executive session originally slated for the end of the agenda. Members met behind closed doors to once again discuss the Braglin case. The executive session lasted about 20 minutes, and was followed by Barga's letter and the announced vote to terminate Braglin."Black lives matter!” protesters said in unison as council members filed out to meet behind closed doors."Why are you running?” asked a disappointed Bill Burke, a member of ISO, with no reply offered.Councilman Taylor Sappington was the lone council member voting against going into executive session. Following the meeting, he told The Messenger that he voted "no” because he wanted the discussion and decision about termination to be done in the open.With the decision to fire Braglin already made, just two audience members requested speaking time when public comments were finally allowed.One of them, Andrea Rainey of Athens, said she will be moving to Nelsonville in August. She thanked council for its action approving Braglin's termination, but offered that it never should have reached a crisis level for the city."I am disappointed in the way it took this long to get to this point,” Rainey said.Rainey called it "unconscionable” that Braglin was still a member of the police department (while on unpaid leave), adding that law enforcement officers are entrusted with ensuring the safety of community members."It's quite embarrassing, frankly,” Rainey said.Another audience member asked if Braglin's disciplinary record, contained in his personnel file, would reflect the council's decision or if it would be wiped clean as it had in the past. After two years, disciplinary records are expunged per a police union contract with the city.City Attorney Garry Hunter responded that personnel records are public records, and that Braglin's termination handed down Wednesday evening would indeed be placed into his personnel file.The council's vote produced some tense words near the end of the meeting. Councilman Greg Smith, who also had previously opposed firing Braglin due to concerns over a wrongful termination lawsuit, voted with council this time because he said "it was done right.” Smith also noted that Braglin's termination included a recommendation from Police Chief Chris Johnson, who is Smith's brother-in-law.In her press conference last week with the NAACP Dayton Unit president, Tims said she had initially spoken with Johnson about Braglin's racially-motivated social media posts. She claimed she had been informed by Johnson that the Nelsonville Police Department did not have a social media policy.However, a public records request from The Messenger revealed that NPD did in fact have a social media policy as far back as at least 2013. The policy spells out action that could lead to termination if a social media offense is serious enough.Johnson did not return a request for comment following the council vote. He has declined comment throughout the Braglin investigation, referring inquiries to the city manager's office.
