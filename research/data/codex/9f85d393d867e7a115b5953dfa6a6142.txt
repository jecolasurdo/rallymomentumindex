LOUIS — More than a half-dozen rallies and demonstrations were held Friday in the St. Louis region — one led by health care workers, another by youth — as outrage continued over the death in Minneapolis of a black man in police custody.Hundreds of doctors, medical students and others lined Kingshighway in the morning outside the Barnes-Jewish Hospital complex.Hand-held signs declared, "Racism is a public health crisis” and "Black children deserve better — stop killing their dads.” One woman wrote "Black Lives Matter” on the back of her white coat.The White Coats for Black Lives event was held in conjunction with hospitals across the country. The crowd stood silently for 8 minutes, 46 seconds — the length of time a Minneapolis police officer pressed his left knee into George Floyd's neck on May 25. An autopsy determined a cause of death for Floyd was asphyxiation. "It's encouraging to see this many people out there, and the response that we're getting from the public as they drive by, ... it really gives me hope, because when these things happen it's really discouraging and hurts in a way that's hard to describe,” said Dr. Wenners Ballard III, an internal medicine specialist. FrontenacAbout 1,000 protesters gathered later in the day for a youth march in Frontenac, organized in part by 2020 Ladue High School graduate Victoria Neal. "Just in case you didn't know why we're in this area, it's because this is where change can be made. This is where they have the money to lobby the government, congressmen and our mayor,” Neal said. "This is the area that has been ignoring the pain and suffering in St. Louis County and St. Louis city and the U.S. I promise you, if they had said something, change would have been made.” According to the latest census estimates, the median household income in Frontenac is about $142,000. That's more than three times the median household income in St. Louis city, and about five times the median income of black households in the city, according to city data. Victoria Neal, youth protest organizer and 2020 Ladue High School graduate. #georgefloyd (Deleted earlier tweet because I accidentally clipped off start of her comments. My apologies.) pic.twitter.com/ExFjD0wvX3 — Joel Currier (@joelcurrier) June 5, 2020 Carlton Adams and Rhonda Adams of Richmond Heights marched with their 10-year-old daughter Riley, who said, "We march because we don't want anybody to be scared to do what they need to do in their daily lives.” Rhonda Adams said she was participating because, "I am George Floyd. I am Ahmaud Arbery. What happens to them could easily be something that happens to any member of my family. We also march for Breonna Taylor today on her birthday." Arbery, who was black, was killed this year in Georgia when he was confronted by two armed white men. Taylor was a black emergency medical technician who was killed while sleeping in her home in March when police burst in during a late-night drug investigation using a so-called "no-knock warrant.” Carlton Adams said he marches because "humanity is at stake," explaining that "400 years of oppression, racism ... is much too long.”St. LouisHonking car horns and excited shouts rang out Friday afternoon as about 250 people lined Grand Boulevard in the Shaw neighborhood.Rev. Matt O'Toole, of St. Margaret of Scotland Church, stood alongside his parishioners, waving to passing cars and speaking on the importance of love. The demonstration was sponsored by St. Margaret of Scotland Church and Compton Heights Christian Church."A lot of our neighbors of color are experiencing harassment and difficulty, so we want to show our support for them and our love,” O'Toole said. "It starts with the heart and not to have animosity or hatred when one sees a person of color in their neighborhood. It's an attitude that has to begin with everyone.”"My son is black,” said Debllie Millet, a 52-year-old St. Louis resident. "He's been feeling very anxious about things that have been happening, and I wanted him to see how much love and support there is in our community.” A demonstrator stands in a crowd gathered in front of Compton Heights Christian Church in the Shaw neighborhood protesting the death of George Floyd Friday, June 5. The demonstration was sponsored by St. Margaret of Scotland Church and Compton Heights Christian Church. Sarah Teague Cris Fischer, 68, of St. Louis, protested alongside her daughter and granddaughter."It's time for white America to step up and make significant changes,” she said. Another large group marched across The Grove district on Friday evening, as close to 500 people marched and blocked traffic. Circuit Attorney Kim Gardner attended, as did family members of Terry Tillman, a man fatally shot by police outside the St. Louis Galleria Mall in 2019. Marchers in The Grove began to disperse soon after the city's 9 p.m. curfew went into effect. Beast Butcher and Block handed out free pulled pork sandwiches to protesters, remarking on the "special opportunity” the restaurant had to help the community.About 50 people also marched to a Wal-Mart in Chesterfield.Curfew extendedThe series of protests came as St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson extended the city's curfew through Sunday."Please be off the streets, off the sidewalks by 9 p.m. this weekend. I'm hopeful we'll be able to lift this curfew in the not-too-distant future,” she said during a news briefing. The curfew is "certainly not to punish protesters. It's not to punish citizens,” she said. "... But the protest leaders that I have spoken with also don't want to see the violence that occurred on Monday evening.” Orderly rallies and protests on Monday ended before sundown. Then tensions escalated. Looters broke into many buildings downtown and burned a 7-Eleven. Krewson issued the curfew order on Tuesday.David Carson, Colter Peterson, Robert Cohen, Christian Gooden, Bryce Gray and Joe Holleman contributed to this report.
