CHARLES • A few hundred protesters marched down Main Street in St. Charles Friday night chanting, "Hey, hey, ho, ho, these killer cops have got to go," one week after a white police officer was acquitted in the shooting death of a black drug suspect.The protesters initially gathered outside Trailhead Brewing Co. and briefly surrounded a car that was trying to pass as police arrived. Later, protesters stopped traffic at the intersection of Main and Jefferson for six minutes, to dramatize the six years it took for authorities to bring former St. Louis patrolman Jason Stockley to trial in the 2011 shooting death of drug suspect Anthony Lamar Smith. Stockley was acquitted of that murder charge last Friday in the death of Smith. The judge's verdict in the bench trial has spawned a week of sometimes violent protests, property damage and scores of arrests. At one point Friday night, protesters walked past several hundred attendees of an Oktoberfest event. Separated by a fence, the attendees yelled at the protesters to go home. Police were seen arresting one man who punched a protester. In other incidents Friday related to the Stockley verdict, the St. Louis Outlet Mall announced it was closing several hours early, at 5 p.m., after protesters indicated on social media they planned to meet at Cabela's parking lot at the Hazelwood mall. Most of the spaces at the struggling mall are empty but a few large tenants remain, including Cabela's, Burlington and an 18-screen Regal movie theater complex. St. Louis Outlet posted on its Facebook page that the mall itself would close at 5 p.m.. Cabela's, which usually is open until 9 p.m. on Fridays, closed at 6 p.m. Friday, according to a notice on its website. Burlington and the Regal theater complex closed at 5 p.m. A "St. Louis Call to Action" notice was posted on social media Friday, urging protesters of the Stockley verdict to assemble at the mall's parking lot at 6:30 p.m. but only a few people showed up and no protest was staged.Those protesting the verdict have held demonstrations throughout the region during the past week, including at several St. Louis area malls. Thursday night, protesters blocked Brentwood Boulevard near the St. Louis Galleria, prompting an early closure at the mall. At Pi Pizzeria on Manchester Road in Kirkwood, plans for two opposing protests following controversial comments by the restaurant's owner apparently failed to materialize late Friday afternoon. In a statement made on social media earlier this week, Pi co-founder Chris Sommers criticized police tactics in quelling protests after last Friday's vercdict, calling it "terrorizing" and "alarming" and lambasting officers for what he described as the warrantless use of tear gas and rubber bullets. Sommers' comments have drawn condemnation from police and sparked plans by police supporters to protest Friday at the Kirkwood Pi. Counterprotesters also had said they would demonstrate in support of Sommers.But according to restaurant workers, the crowd at 6 p.m. was standard for a Friday night, and it was hard to tell if anyone was supporting any issue other than eating pizza. One of the people who showed up was Missouri state Rep. Deb Lavender, D-Kirkwood. "I'm here to support a really good Kirkwood business . . . that's in my district," she said. She added that she had talked with Kirkwood police to make clear that her attendance was not meant to be a statement against police officers. "I support the police as well. There is no 'right side' in this" situation, Lavender said. "I'm here hoping that somehow we can bring both sides to the table."Echoing Lavender's sentiment was retired St. Louis teacher Judy Mutchler. "I'm not 'pro-police' or 'pro-protester," she said. "But sadly it seems to be turning into that." Bill Pautler of Glendale said he showed up to support his daughter and son-in-law, who are both St. Louis police officers. "We lost a lot of sleep worrying about them this weekend," he said. "I thought that what Mr. Sommers said about police officers was totally disrespectful and uncalled for." Sommers, the restaurant co-founder, showed up there in the early evening and declared the threatened pro-police protest "a nothing-burger."
