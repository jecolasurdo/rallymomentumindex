Author: KTVB Staff Published: 11:17 PM MDT June 3, 2020 Updated: 9:33 AM MDT June 4, 2020 BOISE, Idaho — One day after an estimated 5,000 people gathered for a vigil in memory of George Floyd, a small crowd took to the steps of the Idaho Statehouse on Wednesday night. Like Tuesday's vigil, Wednesday's event was peaceful. Both were in honor of Floyd, the black Minneapolis man who died last week while in police custody when an officer kneeled on his neck despite pleas from Floyd saying he couldn't breathe. The protests are also part of a national movement to bring about social change when it comes to racial inequality.
