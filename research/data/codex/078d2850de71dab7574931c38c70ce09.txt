fit Romy Fernandez Editorial Portfolio Tearsheets Contact About Custom Front Page Around 400 protesters have gathered this afternoon for a Black Lives Matter protest at the Dam in Amsterdam. The group protested against police violence. The immediate cause of the demonstration was the continuing police violence against black Americans in the United States and also in The Netherlands. The protest was organized for a woman, Anna Hammond via Facebook. With text and signs on their clothing the demonstrators wanted to express their dissatisfaction with the police violence. They carried signs saying "do not shoot" and pictures of the victims of police violence. The protesters gathered in a circle on Dam Square, and in the course of the afternoon moved the protest on its own initiative in the direction of the 'Beursplein'.
