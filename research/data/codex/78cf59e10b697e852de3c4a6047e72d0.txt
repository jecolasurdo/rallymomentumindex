More from the #BlackLivesMatter peaceful protest in Stoke Park, Guildford this afternoon ðŸ“¹Rob Wallace @eagleradio pic.twitter.com/eqkZBxsCb3â€” NewsQueenðŸ‘‘ (@GraceMcGachy) June 10, 2020 Superintendent Juliet Parker has thanked protesters for their "dignified approach" to this event: "We fully support the right to protest peacefully but, during the current pandemic, this right has to be balanced with the new public health regulations. "We have continued our policing approach of engaging, explaining and encouraging people to follow the health guidance. "We have been speaking to community groups from all backgrounds ahead of any potential protest activity to understand any concerns that they may have. "This is an ongoing dialogue involving borough commanders and community leaders to ensure that we can address any issues raised to us. "Officers were present at the peaceful protest in Guildford with no incidents or reports made to us. "As always, our over-riding aim is to protect and keep people safe across Surrey."
