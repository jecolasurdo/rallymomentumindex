A Black Lives Matter protest Sunday night at Midland Park Mall at times turned contentious but for the most part was peaceful. More than 300 people showed up to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week. The event intensified when a smaller group showed up to counter-protest and support police. The event was scheduled to start at 6 p.m. and protesters trickled in – 60 to 80 strong – at first. However, as the evening progressed, more protesters – white, African American and Hispanic – joined the call for justice. Standing in front of the Old Navy entrance at Midland Park Mall, they held up signs that said, "Latinos for Blacks,” "I'm not black but I will fight for you,” and "Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.” Their calls were for a peaceful protest and justice for Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck during an arrest. It wasn't long into the event – which was publicized through social media and broadcast through Facebook Live broadcasts – that the opposition party showed up. They introduced themselves with shouts of "Here comes the Christians” and "Black the Blue.” They said their mission was also a peaceful one and they called for their opposition to justify the number of abortions that kill even more African Americans every year and flew a flag showing their support for President Trump. They said it was important that the rally not turn into the riots that have been constants in larger cities across the nation. The president was not a popular figure on the Black Lives Matter side. A Black Lives Matter protest Sunday night at Midland Park Mall. More than 300 people showed up to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week. Media: Midland Reporter-Telegram Police officers had been present from the start, but their presence increased when a conflict occurred between the two camps. Police also were peaceful in their presence at Midland Park Mall, serving as a dividing line between the two sides but didn't use force. The officers let both sides shout and even come together a couple times as leaders wanted to know what the other party stood for. Police lines rotated in and out during the event. At first there was a roadway between the two groups, and persons in vehicles driving between would show their support. That ended when law enforcement increased its presence. Onlookers stayed in the parking lot to see how the protests would turn out long after the counter protesters left at about 8:40 p.m. At about 9 p.m. – with only Black Lives Matters protesters remaining – the Midland County Mounted Patrol rode through the area twice where protesters were gathered. It wasn't clear what spurred on the patrol to get involved at that point. Protesters told the Reporter-Telegram that it was important to make their presence felt but to keep it peaceful. This protest wasn't as much about the recent incident involving a 21-year-old Midland man but there were some references to him.
