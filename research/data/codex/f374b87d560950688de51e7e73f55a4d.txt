President Trump turns coronavirus conversation into 'US vs. THEM' Advertisement Breaking News News Mag Mile marchers remember victims of gun violence in Chicago By By Grace Wong and Matt McCall Chicago Tribune | Dec 31, 2015 | 2:14 PM Led by mothers holding pictures of loved ones lost to gun violence in Chicago, about a hundred protesters marched up North Michigan Avenue for about an hour Thursday, adding their calls to demands that Mayor Rahm Emanuel step down.Organized by the Rev. Michael Pfleger of St. Sabina Church, the protesters walked slowly along the upscale business district holding neon signs that read "Demand Peace" and "Black Life Matters." At Chicago Avenue, many of them laid down as police surrounded them. "We're interrupting business as usual," Pfleger told the crowd. "Remember and lay down."The crowd chanted back, "Guns down, peace up."Betty Harwell, 72, relied on an ornately carved walking stick to keep up with the marchers."It's important for us to be out here because we're the forgotten people," she said. "Downtown needs to know that we're here and we matter. Black lives matter and all lives matter."She walked alongside Rastaffri Woods, 56, who was also using a walking stick. He hopes the protest would inspire others."Let it go out to the world that there's a protest here and there can be a protest anywhere," Woods said. "We want to let people know that there's still somebody fighting for them."There have been two other marches up the Mag Mile in the last month, but those were staged in response to recent fatal shootings by Chicago police. Thursday's demonstration was on behalf of the more than 400 people in Chicago who have died in gun violence this year. Advertisement The Rev. Jesse Jackson prayed for all the families who had lost someone to gun violence. Some of the demonstrators knelt and answered "Amen."Then one of the protesters, Ja'Mal Green, took the microphone and led the crowd in a count up to 16 -- for each shot fired at 17-year-old Laquan McDonald by a Chicago police officer in October of 2014."I'm like in awe," said Leslie Papia, 49, from Canada who watched from the sidewalk. "I agree with the protesters. We see it on our news and it's sad that they're being shot. It's nice to see a quiet and peaceful protest and not a violent one." Sisters Karlyncia and Shernila Johnjules decided they needed to march because gun violence is "getting old," according to Shernila Johnjules."I just don't think the issue is going to be resolved until people realize there is still racism in America," she said.Karlyncia Johnjules, a student at the University of Kansas, said she was there in solidarity with her sister."Of course, there's always been the violence," she said. "But it's different when it's somebody you know."When the march ended around 12:30 p.m., some joined protesters at City Hall where a Sponge Bob pinata had been plastered over with photos of the mayor.Several protesters kicked and punched and ripped it apart to chants of "Hey hey! Ho ho! Rahm Emanuel's got to go.""I will be out here everyday so my kids know what police brutality is," one protester said. "Nobody deserves it. Black, white, brown or Arab. Nobody deserves that."A group of about 100 demonstrators sat in a circle on the fifth floor of City Hall outside the mayor's office. Advertisement They bowed their hands, raised their fists and began to loudly chant: "The people united will never be defeated." They then hugged each other. Around 2 p.m., the crowd left City Hall."We used to have a sign that said, 'We call police,' " Evangel Mama Dee said as people spilled out into the Loop. "Now we have a sign that says, 'We don't call police.'
