According to the Associated Press, three WNBA teams were fined $5000 and players were fined $500 each for wearing shirts supporting Black Lives Matter and honoring slain police officers before games over the past two weeks. It was a gesture that even WNBA commissioner Lisa Borders seemed to praise — but not enough to give them a pass this time. From the Associated Press: The Liberty have worn the plain black shirts four times, including Wednesday morning against Washington. The Mercury and Fever wore them Tuesday night. While the shirts were the Adidas brand — the official outfitter of the league — WNBA rules state that uniforms may not be altered in any way. Before the fines were levied, teams were reminded in a memo of this policy earlier this week and warned that they may be fined if they continue to wear the shirts. "We are proud of WNBA players' engagement and passionate advocacy for non-violent solutions to difficult social issues but expect them to comply with the league's uniform guidelines,” WNBA President Lisa Borders said in a statement provided to The Associated Press on Wednesday night. On Twitter, Phoenix Mercury forward Mistie Bass pointed out what seems to be the direct contradiction. "Don't say we have a voice and then fine us because we use it. #notpuppets #cutthestrings,” she wrote. Don't say we have a voice and then fine us because we use it. #notpuppets #cutthestrings — Mistie Bass (@A_Phoenix_Born) July 21, 2016 This isn't the first time that the issue has come up. Last year when NBA players were 'I can't breathe' t-shirts, NBA commissioner Adam Silver also said while he supported their activism, he would prefer if they not violate uniform rules. At the Board of Governors meeting last week, he offered his support again but gave his reasoning for wanting to keep the uniform rules in tact — no matter the cause. "My preference would be that players adhere to our uniform rules, both in the NBA and the WNBA. I think it's a very slippery slope,” he said. "As to where you would draw the line when it's appropriate for a particular player to use that, use a game, pregame, as a political forum, I think it's a dangerous road for us to go down. So I would greatly prefer that the players use the platform they're given, social media, press conferences, media in locker rooms, however they want to do it, to make their political points of view be known.” In an interview with the Indy Star on Tuesday, Indiana Fever veteran Tamika Catchings said it was hard to follow the uniform rules — which require uniforms not be altered in any way — but said it was important for the players' voices to be heard. "We understand you go out on a branch when it's something that you support, but I think one thing that we've done a really good job of is that we've supported not just Black Lives Matter, but Orlando and everything that hit there,” she told the newspaper. "That's something that we jumped on and we supported.” As a general rule, we often brush off fines that we hear players or coaches getting — after all, in most professional sports their salaries are so far above what most of us can imagine that even fines in the tens of thousands of dollars can only really mean a drop in the bucket. But for WNBA players, that's just not the case. The highest salaries paid in the WNBA are just slightly over six figures while rookie salaries are around $40,000. And more importantly, it sent a mixed message about the allowing the players, who are role models for so many, to have their voices be heard. This time it comes in the case of an issue, that as Swin Cash told For The Win last week, hits home for so many women. "Through my conversations with players, people need to understand it, as professional athletes we also have hearts,” the Liberty veteran said. "There have been tears that have been shed, there have been emotional roller coasters of highs and lows and if we feel like that and other women in our league feel like that, then our responsibility is to try to figure out and try to deal with the issue at hand. So you have a platform and you try to use it. The conversations have been amazing because the women have been opening up and trying to deal with things that other people in society are trying to deal with.” Despite Silver's warnings about a slippery slope, as valid as that concern may be, that's where the WNBA's focus should be — not enforcing uniform rules.
