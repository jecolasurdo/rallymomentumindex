(WFXR) — Roanoke City leaders want residents to know that they are not against protesting. "I really feel the pain, and that's why we support everyone's right to peacefully assemble,” said Mayor Sherman Lea, recalling what it was like to grow up as a teenager during the Civil Rights Movement. However, the constitutional right to assemble can be taken away if the protest is no longer peaceful. According to Roanoke Police Chief Sam Roman, several in Saturday's Black Lives Matter protest pushed the boundaries. "Once actions escalate beyond what is peaceful, you know, we have an obligation... because generally those actions are just made by a few, and we have the obligation to make sure that the entire environment is safe. So we would have to declare that as an illegal assembly and then take the appropriate action,” Roman said. "...and they cause concern for safety, not only the officers but also of the crowd that was there,” Lea added. Law enforcement arrested seven people, in total. They are: Tyreek Burrows – 28 of Roanoke — charged with unlawful gathering and possession of a concealed firearmDevon Johnson – 27 of Roanoke – charged with unlawful assemblyKhairajhn Sims – 25 of Roanoke – charged with unlawful assemblyTrevor MacDermott – 26 of Roanoke – charged with unlawful assemblyAnnabelle Layman – 25 of Blacksburg – charged with unlawful assemblyTre'vaughn Wilson – 27 of Roanoke – charged with simple assault (this relates to an incident that happened before police arrived at the Walmart)Cadie Baglin – 20 of Troutville – charged with unlawful assembly Law enforcement was equipped with rubber bullets and tear gas but only used pepper spray as a method of crowd control. For future protests, both Lea and Roman hope there won't be a need for any use of force, but they will do so if peace becomes unlikely. "Our message is that we definitely want to advocate for peaceful protest,” Roman said. "We do not condone vandalism or violence of any kind like we saw last night,” Lea said. At the news conference on Sunday, May 31, Roanoke City Manager Bob Cowell made the announcement that the city had been placed under a local state of emergency, which would give Cowell the authority to place the city under a mandatory curfew. At this time, no curfew has been established.
