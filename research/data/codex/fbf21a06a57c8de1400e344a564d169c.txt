All of these protestors did was yell. We watched the whole scene play out. Just a bunch of yelling before the tear gas and flashbang were deployed. pic.twitter.com/EwwBjw5h4E— Joe Spears (@joe_spears7) June 1, 2020Situation really starting to escalate now over at Middle Tennessee Blvd and Main St. Officers in an armored vehicle throwing tear gas and flash bangs. One man is being taken away after taking a huge hit from from the tear gas. I'll have video up ASAP #Murfreesboro— Joe Spears (@joe_spears7) May 31, 2020Law enforcement deployed tear gas into a crowd at the corner of East Main Street and Middle Tennessee Boulevard. pic.twitter.com/Z3WpX3NNSW— Brinley Hineman (@brinleyhineman) May 31, 2020Heavy police presence now in front of The Boulevard across from MTSU. pic.twitter.com/9aX9VoUNgd— Brinley Hineman (@brinleyhineman) May 31, 2020Over at Forrest Hall. Protestors are talking with @MTSUPolice about a strategy to get everyone back to their cars safely. Both sides came to an agreement for some officers to walk everyone back. Much different scene than what we witnessed earlier. #Murfreesboropic.twitter.com/5ZD7QBkarK— Joe Spears (@joe_spears7) June 1, 2020CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://www.dnj.com/story/news/2020/05/31/murfreesboro-protest-george-floyd-tear-gas-curfew/5303260002/Find JobsShare your feedback to help improve our site experience!
