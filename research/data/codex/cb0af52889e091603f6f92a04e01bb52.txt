Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Update: 3:40 p.m. Sunday, July 10, 2016Baton Rouge police are saying out-of-town protestors are causing some demonstrations here to become more violent, a night after more than 100 people were arrested along Airline Highway, eight guns were seized and an officer had his teeth knocked out."Any protest that becomes violent will be immediately dispersed," the department announced in a press release Sunday afternoon.Under the heading "A Tale of Two Protests," the statement noted that no one was arrested during a Saturday march -- organized by local community leaders -- from City Hall to the State Capitol.During the protest near police headquarters on Airline Highway, police confiscated three rifles, three shotguns and two pistols Saturday, police said.A Baton Rouge police officer had several teeth knocked out "as a projectile was thrown from the protest,” the release stated."It appears the protest at Baton Rouge Police Headquarters have become more violent as out of town protesters are arriving," BRPD said in the release.Sheriff Sid Gautreaux said Sunday afternoon that 19 of the 132 arrested at the protests Friday and Saturday were from out of state.Update: 10:45 a.m. Sunday, July 10, 2016According to a list of bookings, 102 people were arrested and booked into East Baton Rouge Parish Prison in connection with the protests overnight.Many of the arrests were for obstruction of a highway, according to records.Update: ?10:20 a.m. July 10, 2016Authorities in Baton Rouge say more than 100 people were jailed in connection with the Black Lives Matter protests held over the weekend.Spokeswoman Casey Rayborn Hicks of the East Baton Rouge Sheriff's Office told The Associated Press on Sunday that 101 people were being held in the parish jail in connection with the protests. No information was immediately available on what charges they faced or whether some people were later released.Louisiana State Police spokesman Maj. Doug Cain said "most of the charges (from Saturday night) are going to be obstruction of a highway."We've been very clear that we want them to have every opportunity to protest and voice their opinion," Cain said. "But if you move into the roadway and break the law, you're going to be arrested."Jail records as of 12:30 a.m. Sunday show about 60 people booked with simple obstruction of a highway of commerce and a few people arrested on counts of inciting to riot. The majority of people arrested up until that time appear to be from Baton Rouge, although there are a few from as far away as San Francisco, Houston, Dallas, Virginia and Oklahoma.On Sunday morning, Lynette Allen, of Baton Rouge, was waiting at the East Baton Rouge Parish Prison to pick up two of her friends who were arrested at the protests.Allen was working the night shift Saturday when she got a call around 11 p.m. about the arrests. She got off work at 7 a.m. and then later headed over to wait for her two friends' release."I just want to go to sleep when this is over," Allen said. "I have to go back to work tonight."Staff and wire reportsLast updated: 2:20 a.m., July 10, 2016Five days after the fatal police shooting of Alton Sterling, demonstrators on Saturday continued to hold rallies and marches in Baton Rouge, protests that grew increasingly heated as the night wore on.Police response to the protesters grew more aggressive late in the night. At least twice, officers outfitted in riot gear charged at a group of protesters, scattering people in all directions. Several people were then seen to be arrested.Over the course of the demonstration, scores of protesters were arrested or detained, including at least two members of the media and national Black Lives Matter activist Deray Mckesson. A Baton Rouge police spokesman said two officers were injured, although how seriously was unclear.The Saturday night arrests came a day after 30 people were arrested during protests about Sterling's death.Can't see the video below?

Asked about the officer pulling his gun on Saturday, Baton Rouge Police Chief Carl Dabadie Jr. said that incident is under review, and if it turns out that an officer pointed a handgun at protesters simply to urge them to disperse, that he would not support those actions."These officers are on edge. They're scared just like the public is. But we don't condone that, and it has been addressed,” he said.Dabadie said he did not immediately know the officer's name. But he said if the lawman used the weapon merely to make protesters move out of the way, "That would not be normal.”Dabadie said those arrested late Friday and early Saturday at a protest outside police headquarters after the police killing of Sterling had every opportunity to avoid being detained."We gave them multiple warnings. We had some city leaders out there, also, begging them not to get in the streets,” he said while walking out of a morning briefing with other law enforcement officials. "We can't afford for Airline Highway to get blocked, and we definitely don't want anybody to get hurt.”There were 30 protesters arrested and booked into Parish Prison on Friday night or Saturday morning, according to records from the East Baton Rouge Parish Sheriff's Office, which runs the lockup.All of those arrested were from Baton Rouge except two from Denham Springs and one from Prairieville, said Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Casey Rayborn Hicks. Most face counts of obstructing a highway, while three are accused of inciting a riot and one is accused of battery on a police officer in addition to other counts, the records show.Dabadie said his officers are tired and are taking all precautions in the wake of a sniper killing of five officers at a rally in Dallas this past week. Those officers were killed by what officials have said they be a lone gunman as they guarded a peaceful protest in part honoring Sterling and denouncing his death."They're working very long hours. The heat is playing a role also,” he said. "This 95-, 100-degree heat takes its toll when you have an officer fully geared out.”At a mid-afternoon rally outside the Triple S store, community activist Arthur "Silky Slim” Reed warned that if East Baton Rouge Mayor-President Kip Holden did not resign within 72 hours, protests would not remain peaceful. He called for onlookers to picket Holden's home, though several hours later, none had arrived.Holden was at his home Saturday afternoon under guard from several police officers and said he would not run from protesters, but he didn't plan to address them either.
