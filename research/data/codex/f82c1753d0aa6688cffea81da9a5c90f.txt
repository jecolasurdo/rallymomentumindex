Dozier, DFP)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREEAST LANSING -- Nine black Michigan State football players held their fists aloft during the "Star-Spangled Banner" today, two weeks after three did so before the Wisconsin game.Delton Williams and Gabe Sherrod again held up their fists as a demonstration against racial violence prior to the Spartans' game against BYU. Seven other players joined them: Devyn Salmon, Cam Chambers, Andrew Dowell, Tyson Smith, Khari Willis, Robert Bowers and T.J. Harrell.Kenney Lyke, who did it before the Wisconsin game, did not today.Sherrod signaled his intentions during the week before the Wisconsin game with a tweet saying he was ready to support the movement related to police shootings of African Americans. The graduate transfer previously attended Delaware State, a historically black university.MSU coach Mark Dantonio said after the Wisconsin game that he supported his players' right to voice their opinions."Your patriotism, your faith are sort of the same thing,” Dantonio said. "That's it, that's your choice, and it's influenced by what you've experienced in this world. And so whether someone salutes, puts a hand over their heart or does something else, everybody has a choice to make."We're in college -- our young people are in college. And I can promise you one thing, that when the flag is presented in some respect, I guess it becomes much more important now. It's not just, 'Oh, by the way, here is the 'Star-Spangled Banner.' I guess they have decisions that people have to make. And as long as it's done in a peaceful way, this is America. And that's what the flag stands for. It stands for that freedom to do what you need to do. And that's the beautiful thing about this country.”FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInBYU 31, Michigan State 14 FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
