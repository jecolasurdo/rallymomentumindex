An alleged snub of a black cheerleader was the cause. Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Some 25 Dunwoody High School students protested Monday morning at the school under the banner of the Black Lives Matter movement. The protest was sparked by an allegation of racism by a black cheerleader but organizers used social media to invite anyone with an example of a slight to participate.The protest was sanctioned by the school district and, according to Principal Priscilla Cole before the event, "To ensure the protest is peaceful, we will have additional officers on campus as well district support.”The situation escalated through the student body after Cole sent out a blast email and a robo-call to the school community.The Dunwoody varsity football cheer team has annually created a photo collage for its coach at the end of the season. This year, the tradition continued as in past years and one of the cheerleaders took the responsibility to print several dozen pictures of the squad via Walgreen's web site.The original cheer photos were uploaded to the Walgreens platform and printed to a smaller size. Instead of manually cropping each photo, the cheerleader printing the photos used the web site's photo software that auto-cropped them. Although practical, the software automatically cut out multiple cheerleaders in several photos. Many girls' images were cut in half and others left out of pictures. The photos where girls were cropped out were not used for the collage, nor were they distributed. The rejected photos were placed in a pile on the cheer coach's desk. Ultimately, the collage was presented to the cheerleading coach at last week's banquet and every cheerleader is featured in the collage multiple times.Before the unused photos were thrown away, however, Suzie Mbowe, the only African American cheerleader on the squad, saw a picture in the discard pile where she was cropped out. Without confronting anyone about what she suspected was an act of racism by another cheerleader who purposely cropped her out, Suzie posted the original picture next to the cropped picture on social media.Although she took it down the next day at Dunwoody High School administration's request, peers who saw Suzie's original post began posting, retweeting, and commenting about the photo. The notion that some white cheerleaders at DHS actively participated in a racist act to exclude Suzie went viral with over 4,000 related retweets.On the internet, the situation has escalated to people harassing and calling DHS cheerleaders rude names, despite the fact that only one girl participated in printing the photos, and that person placed blame with the auto-crop feature. In defense, another cheerleader posted a video online, recreating the photo editing gaffe to show how the autocrop could have occurred."The photo was something I believe was done on purpose,” Suzie said.Despite this belief, when discussing the protest she said, "I don't think it's the right move but I can't stop someone for standing up for what they believe in.” Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Load comments × Post a comment as Guest Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text CAPTCHA Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.
