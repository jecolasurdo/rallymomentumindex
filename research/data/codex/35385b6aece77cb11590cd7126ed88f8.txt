(Mark Kodiak Ukena, Lake County News-Sun) Chants of "No justice, no peace," "Black lives matter" and "Stop the killing, stop the violence" filled the air around the Lake County Building in Waukegan on Thursday afternoon. Nine people marched around the block surrounding the building to protest police brutality against African-Americans, one week after police officers shot and killed two black men in separate incidents in Minnesota and Louisiana. Some held up signs and others wore T-shirts, including one woman whose shirt read, "I matter." Advertisement "We might be little in numbers, but we got big in strength," Clyde McLemore, chairperson for Lake County Black Lives Matter, told the gathering. The group might have gained more participants on a weekend, but McLemore said he wanted to plan the protest for a weekday so people working in the courthouse could hear them. As three bicycle police officers monitored the crowd from across the street, McLemore discussed criticism about violence surrounding Black Lives Matter, declaring the organization is not a terrorist group. Advertisement Not all police officers are bad, McLemore said. But he thinks sensitivity training would help interactions between residents and police officers in Lake County.

"They get paid time off, administrative leave, they go on vacation. So killing a black man is to them like killing an animal in the street. We're roadkill." Community activist Ralph Peterson Jr. said he does not condone violence against police or any innocent person but understands why an African-American gunman killed five police officers and injured others in Dallas last week. "Police officers are just killing and getting off," Peterson said. "They drove him insane." Tio Hardiman, president of Violence Interrupters, said anybody who condones violence against the police or innocent people is wrong. But, he said, the country has a history of more than 400 years of "serious atrocities" committed against African-American people. "So what you see now in the year 2016 is you see the voices of, the spirits of the dead people speaking through the youth now, so to speak," Hardiman said.
