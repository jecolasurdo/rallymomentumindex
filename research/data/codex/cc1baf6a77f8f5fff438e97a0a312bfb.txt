Traffic below slowed as the demonstrators, about 170 by the mid-afternoon, shouted and hollered. Some drivers laid on their horns in support, getting celebratory cheers in return. For about four hours, the demonstration was peaceful from beginning to end. Protesters walking up to the overpass from nearby parking lots chatted amiably with California Highway Patrol officers at a traffic stop. "I have family members who are police,” said Antoinette Savedra, a 37-year-old from Covina. "They're all on edge, too.” Savedra said she was at the Barranca Street overpass on Monday to show solidarity with other protesters. She said she believed the issue of police brutality was bigger than any one officer. "There's a wider issue here” of lack of respect for each other, she said. As they laid down on Monday, protesters on the overpass chanted "I can't breathe” — the same words spoke by George Floyd, a unarmed black man who died in custody of Minnesota police when an officer put a knee to his neck. Protests locally and around the country have been happening since Wednesday. Some have ended in stores being vandalized and looted. Police have fired rubber bullets and tear gas at demonstrators and the media. West Covina police spokesman Lt. Travis Tibbetts said entrances to the nearby Eastland Center were closed. Chris Rix, a 39-year-old La Verne resident, rounded up several dozen protesters for a prayer near the end of the demonstration. Rix, a coach at the Fellowship of Christian Athletes who played for Bishop Amat Memorial High School, prayed for peace, for police officers and for his "black brothers and sisters.” Rix said he and his wife, who are white, are raising their foster son, who is black. He said his son will grow up with a different life than he did — Rix said he hopes his son won't have to worry about discrimination and injustice. "If we want anything to be better, in 10 years, in 15 years, you have to be a part of something, you have to do something now,” he said. "If I want things to change, what will I be able to say I did about it?” Many protesters at the bridge Monday were angry over the repeated incidents of police brutality against African Americans. Ariela Burns, 21, a University of La Verne student, said she's been stopped in her car at least five or six times since she was 18 years old. The first time, she said she waited with a friend for 45 minutes before police told her they stopped her for not having a license plate. She said the encounter left her worried. "They treated me like a criminal,” she said.
