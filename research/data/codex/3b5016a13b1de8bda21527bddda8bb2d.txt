The march began at the Town Green before heading south to the intersection of San Ramon Valley Boulevard and the Town and Country Shopping Center, Danville Police Chief Allan Shields told Patch. Marchers then headed back north before concluding again at the Town Green. There, the crowd took a knee in silence, Cathy Burkholder, executive pastor at the Community Presbyterian Church in Danville, told Patch.

"I would like to thank the protesters and the organizers for taking great care to conduct a peaceful protest."See Also:Tri-Valley Protests, Businesses Board Up During National UnrestDanville Protests Continue In Honor Of George FloydPleasanton Protesters Kneel In The Streets For Moment of SilenceLivermore Protesters Decry Racial Injustice ThursdaySubscribe Back to the Danville Patch More from DanvilleUp next on Danville Patch Local News | 1h SEE: Fawn Rescued In San Ramon, Reunited With Mom 1h Local News | 18h City Center Bishop Ranch Reopens For Outdoor Dining: San Ramon 18h Local News | 3d What Is Juneteenth? 5 Things To Know About The Holiday 3d Read more local news from Danville What are Featured Events?
