Activities director Brian Hosken told KTVA-TV that he and school administrators are going to conduct a review on Monday before deciding whether the students face any action. RELATED: Entire San Francisco team kneels for anthem Principal Rick Stone declined to comment and would not allow interviews with players after the Saturday game against South Anchorage High School. The Anchorage students join a growing number of athletes to take action similar to San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who stopped standing during the anthem to protest racial injustice.
