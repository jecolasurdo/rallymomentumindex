JESSIE WARDARSKI/Tulsa World Jessie Wardarski Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save As afternoon shifted to evening on the third day of Mayfest, a group of about 10 began to silently smear red paint on their white T-shirts. Then they died — figuratively, of course.About 6:20 p.m. the demonstrators laid in a haphazard circle at the intersection of Main and Third streets as part of a "die-in.” They laid in vibrant chalk outlines of their own silhouettes. Most held signs, which they propped up in the steady blowing wind as they pretended to be dead.One sign resting on the back of a man lying face down on the asphalt read, "This is community policing?” Another said, "Respect my existence or respect my resistance.” Another: "We demand justice.” The protest was partly in response to a jury finding Tulsa Police Officer Betty Shelby not guilty of manslaughter in the death of Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man she fatally shot in September.Organizer Tykebrean McClain said the demonstration's other aim was to show people what it is like to be bombarded with images and videos on social media of the people, mainly of color, killed by police."Some people are able to ignore it,” McClain said, "And some people see that person looking just like them, and we're not able to ignore it.”Unlike on Facebook where someone can scroll by images and reaction to those shootings, it was nearly impossible for people walking by the scene to ignore it.When someone sees the protest, and perhaps walks around it to get where they are going, demonstrator Xochitl Deseret said she feels she is making a difference.”It's that moment in time that someone passes by that I feel like I might be helping them, because I'm helping them understand that someone cares this much, that we care enough to do this, to organize and to educate, to try to acknowledge what's happened,” Deseret said.The protest attracted a steady stream of spectators, who gathered at the edges of the demonstration. Many took pictures or streamed live video of it on Facebook. Richard Wright, of Broken Arrow, was walking down Main Street on his first visit to Mayfest when he happened upon the protest and helped one of the demonstrators by drawing a blue chalk outline around their body."I'm kind of proud that things are being taken notice of,” Wright said, adding, "I don't want to take any respect away from the law enforcement officers who actually do their job and take they jobs very seriously, because their job is very dangerous daily.”Wright, who is black, said he was happy someone was talking about the inequities leveled against the black community."It's just that it's being given a look at and being delved into more than it was, because it's always been here. Black people, we've been dealing with that kind of brutality for a long, long time, and not only did it come from the police, it just came from your average citizen,” he said.While not all reaction to the demonstration was positive (some people passed by muttering profanity or other denouncements, while others responded saying "blue lives matter”), passersby Stephanie Lopez and Sierra Roston said they were glad someone was raising awareness for the issue of bias in policing.Both women of color, Lopez and Roston said bias and profiling doesn't just affect black people. They experience it regularly."It's Hispanic people, Middle Eastern people, it's so many people, and we don't want to realize what the true problem and what the true severity of it is,” Lopez said.paighten.harkins @tulsaworld.comTwitter: @PaightenHarkins Paighten Harkins918-581-8455paighten.harkins@tulsaworld.comTwitter: @PaightenHarkins Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Tags Shooting Of Terence Crutcher Black Lives Matter Mayfest Red Paint Oklahoma Richard Wright Arrow Betty Shelby Sierra Roston Terence Crutcher Xochitl Deseret Law Enforcement Officers Social Media Stephanie Lopez Law Criminal Law Protest Demonstrator Police Most Popular Tulsa World editorial: This is the wrong time and Tulsa is the wrong place for the Trump rally Tulsa Health Department director 'wishes' Trump rally would be postponed as local COVID cases surge COVID-19: Infections peak again for Tulsa County, Oklahoma with more than 200 new cases reported 43 years ago, the murders of three Girl Scouts in Oklahoma stunned the nation, created shockwaves still being felt Gov.
