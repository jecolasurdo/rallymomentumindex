"We're not an enemy to be vanquished, but a people to be treasured.”After the crowd watched a short video about the death of Crutcher, whose killing led to a manslaughter charge against Officer Betty Shelby, Williams discussed the role of race in their deaths."Two men will never wake up again, simply because their skin was too dark.”Other than a driver angry about waiting for the marching pedestrians to cross Haggard Avenue who began yelling and honking, the protestors' demonstration didn't encounter any known problems.The march around campus culminated outside of Moseley Center, where provost Steven House took the lectern, as did university chaplain Jan Fuller, Williams and Kaelyn Green, another student."We are making strides, but we have much work to build a community in which each member is valued,” House told those gathered. "It is within that ethos of mutual respect that we must work as a university community and as a broader society to ensure justice for black communities.”Quoting scripture from 1 Peter 2:17 and Romans 12:10, House said that he was sad and frustrated about how people are treating each other, but "(finds) hope in a gathering such as this one.”"I'm discouraged, and that is why I'm turning back to God for strength and understanding,” he said. "That is why I keep praying for peace and justice. That is why I pray for God's grace and forgiveness. That is why I pray I understand what I can do and how I can join you in making things better.”Closing out the program, Green encouraged everyone in attendance to "be an ally to people of color,” and for "people of color to allow allies to support them.”"Today, our silence was loud, and our black was solid and our unity was strong,” she said.The university is holding a panel of faculty and staff members Monday to discuss recent police shootings. The event will be held from 5 to 6:15 p.m. in McBride Gathering Space in the Numen Lumen Pavilion.On Oct. 3, several student organizations are hosting an event to discuss how to be an effective ally to minorities, held in Lakeside 214 from 7 to 8:30 p.m. Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you.
