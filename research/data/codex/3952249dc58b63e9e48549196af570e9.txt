Jess Nocera/BHC Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save ABINGDON, Va. — Husband and wife Rees and Kathy Shearer were in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend assisting at a local church to provide a safe space for people during the protests."We did see the results of it [the protests],” Rees Shearer said. "People came in [to the church] unable to talk, hysterically, really.”On Saturday morning, the Emory, Virginia, couple stood on the corners of Main Street and Cummings Street in Abingdon, Virginia, in the "Abingdon UNITY Rally to Counter-Protest,” hosted by the Young Appalachians Patriots (YAP). "[I] don't want the infection of white supremacy to take hold here,” Rees Shearer said, who was holding an American flag and a sign that read "Don't mistake Racism for Patriotism.”Approximately 100 people came to the Unity Rally — coming and going — and stood on all four corners of Main Street and Cummings Street. Many brought signs with phrases that expressed support for all people, including "Black Lives Matter,” "Virginia is for Everyone,” "We Are All Earth Beings,” "I am made of love” and more.The main idea of Saturday's rally was unity, said rally organizer and YAP secretary Sarah Laughland, who was holding a sign featuring the Nelson Mandela quote, "There is no such thing as part freedom.”"Even if people could only come for 15 or 20 minutes, they did, and they showed up,” said Laughland, who was wearing a "Black Lives Matter” pin and a "Mother Earth” pin.YAP is a nonpartisan group that was established in 2016 "to mobilize young Appalachians in making changes in the region,” according to Laughland.The group participated in the Aug. 12 peace demonstration in Abingdon, held on the same street corner in response to the violence that occurred in Charlottesville, Virginia, last weekend."There are a lot of people divided in this town, in this region,” Laughland, an Abingdon resident, said. The idea is "how can we use our anger to be united rather than be angry and divided?”Robert Kell, YAP's community outreach chair, joined the group because was looking for a way to effect change locally. "I wanted to be with friends around my age to put out a new narrative, a space for a new community,” said Kell, a Marion, Virginia, resident.For Kell, a purpose of Saturday's rally was to "let people of color know that there are people here to support them and create a safe space for them.”YAP also collected canned goods and other donations for Feeding America Southwest Virginia's food bank during the rally."We also wanted to be giving back to our community, and since we only had three days [in planning the rally], we figured the food bank always needs food,” Laughland said. "It was the simplest way to give back quickly.”A lot of drivers passing by honked their support, yelling out positive messages or sticking out their hand while making a peace sign.Susan Booher, an Abingdon resident, who attended the rally with her children, Hunter and Lyric, was holding an American flag upside down."It's a symbol of distress,” Booher said.Abingdon citizen Peggy McKoan came to the rally because of her father."I'm here because my father landed on Omaha Beach on D-Day, and for him to see Nazi flags [now] would kill him,” McKoan said. "But the hate is deeper than that, and that's why I'm here.”Avery Coonts, an Arkansas resident and production intern with Barter Theatre who attended the rally, thinks people need to "come together and love together” during this time."Compassion and love supersedes hate — always,” Coonts said. "What the world needs right now is love, not just for some, but for everyone.” jnocera@bristolnews.com | 276-669-2181 Extension: 3371 | Twitter: @jessmnocera Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Tags Highway Virginia Economics Medicine Sarah Laughland Politics Abingdon Rally Yap Robert Kell Susan Booher Unity Protest Counter-protest Counter Counter Protest Jess Nocera Recommended for you Welcome to the Conversation No name-calling, personal insults or threats.
