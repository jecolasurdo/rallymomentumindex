Alfred/The San Diego Union-Tribune) The young demonstrators want more funding for schools and parks, less for law enforcement By Deborah Sullivan Brennan June 10, 20206:23 PM Facebook Twitter Show more sharing options Share Close extra sharing options Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Email Copy Link URLCopied! Print About 75 protestors demonstrated in front of Escondido City Hall, calling for the City Council to reallocate some of its law enforcement budget toward community and youth programs.The peaceful demonstration, consisting mostly of teens and young adults, was planned by Orange Glen High School students, who held an earlier protest at City Hall last Friday. It was part of nearly two straight weeks of demonstrations throughout San Diego in protest of the killing of George Floyd, a Black Minneapolis man who died after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, restricting his breathing.Nearly all the protestors wore masks in compliance with COVID-19 precautions and waved signs that read, "Invest in people, not just police,” and "Fund community, not cops.” Organizer Grace Lashley, 17, said that because the event fell on the same day as the council's budget adoption, protestors decided to focus on city funding and police reform. "We want to take the 43 percent (of the budget allocated) toward police, and put it some of it toward community groups and schools,” said Lashley, who is African-American.

Alfred/The San Diego Union-Tribune) Lashley said students are upset about planned reductions in education funding, which include a proposed 10 percent cut to K-12 education in Gov. Gavin Newsom's draft state budget. They're concerned that their school could eliminate classes including foreign language, advanced placement and career technical electives, and they want the city to help fill the gap.They also want the city to prioritize parks, recreation and other community programs.Her classmate Leslee Soria, 16, passed out homemade buttons with a black raised fist against a red background, created by fellow student Andrea Vasquez, 17. The girls, both Hispanic, said they wanted to support the Black community, and have shared concerns about safety and equity. Advertisement "This is a struggle for Black Lives Matter, and it's also an issue we're fighting to have equality for all people of color,” Soria said."We really want to make a difference in the world, because it's the world we'll grow up in,” said Vasquez, who said she has been involved in previous events for women's rights and climate action.McKenna Griffin, 20, demonstrated with several friends, saying she wanted to become educated about inequity and violence confronting the black community, and to help fight those problems."I felt like I was not really informed of the extent of anti-Black violence until the murder of George Floyd,” said Griffin, who is white. Advertisement Although the most of the demonstrators were youth, a few older adults joined the event.Linda Miles, 68, of Escondido, who is African-American, said her first experience with demonstrating was as a seventh grade student in Bakersfield in the 1960s. She and classmates were required to say the Pledge of Allegiance each day beneath an American Flag, flying alongside a Confederate flag. She said students began leaving class at 10 a.m. every day to protest the Confederate flag, and after two weeks, the school removed it from campus."We're here because we want justice for all,” she said Wednesday."Not just Black people, but all people. We want to spread love around the world.” Public SafetyLatestEscondidoNorth County George Floyd Newsletter Sign up to get Breaking News email alerts Get alerts on severe weather, road closures and other major breaking news.
