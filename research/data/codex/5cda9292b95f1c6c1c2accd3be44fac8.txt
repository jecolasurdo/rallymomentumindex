The marches this weekend in Green Bay were peaceful.Buy PhotoBlack Lives Matter protesters march to demand an end to police brutality on June 10, 2020, in De Pere, Wis. (Photo: Sarah Kloepping/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)The start of Wednesday's #BustUpTheSilence march was delayed slightly in hope the rain would lessen. Protesters marched from 6 p.m. to just after 8 p.m. in the rain. Among the crowd were families, including small children, who traveled the about 5-mile protest route.Lundin and co-organizer Tevin Taylor wanted to bring attention to the Black Lives Matter movement to the affluent predominantly white suburb. According to 2019 U.S. Census population estimates, 0.7% of the population is black in De Pere, while 91% is white.

"And most of the protests that have been happening have been in the predominantly black neighborhoods. And when that happens, we're not coming into the white neighborhoods where most of the people who are in positions of power live. They don't necessarily have to deal with it. Right? It's away from it, it's not in their neighborhood, they don't have to deal with it.”For that reason, Taylor said, it's important for protesters to show up, including as many white allies as possible, and bring protest to these neighborhoods.Buy PhotoTevin Taylor, who co-organized a protest in response to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, speaks to about 100 people who marched throughout De Pere in the rain on June 10, 2020.

From the bridge, they traveled along South Broadway and stopped at Dickinson Elementary. Toward the beginning of the protest, they were greeted by drivers honking their horns in support.In front of Dickinson Elementary, black community members shared perspectives with the crowd. Zac Riha of Allouez, a former De Pere resident, said he was out there for his children, and that he had grown up in Green Bay as one of the only black children in his class. He was adopted from Texas and his family is multiracial.Taylor said by Dickinson Elementary that this protest addresses one of the pillars of white supremacy. "Things will never be the same if we capitalize on this moment. We cannot let this momentum slip away," Taylor told the crowd.Co-organizer Tevin Taylor spoke to the crowd after Black community members shared perspectives. pic.twitter.com/4ktmkMggBA— Nusaiba Mizan (@nusaiblah) June 10, 2020From Dickinson Elementary, protesters continued past De Pere High School and traveled along Chicago Street. They turned down Swan Road and down Old Valley Road through a De Pere neighborhood that had houses with three-car garages. Some residents left their houses and quietly watched the protesters pass.As the protesters moved through more neighborhoods and past more houses, some residents watched them go by, and some clapped or shouted support from their door, such as a man who came out of a home on Chicago Street and clapped for the protesters. At least once someone shouted support from an upstairs window, while at another house an elderly lady stood on her deck and gave the protesters a thumbs up sign.De Pere police followed the protest and blocked off roads, including the Broadway and Main Avenue roundabout on the way back from east De Pere to west De Pere where protesters chanted for several minutes at the roundabout and knelt on the road.Protesters chanted and knelt at Broadway roundabout for several minutes. pic.twitter.com/5Ab2e9dirA— Nusaiba Mizan (@nusaiblah) June 11, 2020Through downtown west De Pere along Reid Street, restaurant and retail employees came out to express their support or went to their doors to video the event. Four employees on shift at one establishment raised fists in solidarity with the protesters as they stood at the window.Born and raised in De Pere, Julian Pavia was upset by the video recording of the killing of George Floyd and how protesters were treated across the country."I'm here today because I felt like I had to do something. This is really the first time in my life I felt like I had to do something," Pavia said.He said this kind of turnout for a protest in a place like De Pere is encouraging.Buy PhotoProtesters march across the Claude Allouez Bridge in De Pere to demand an end to police brutality during a rain storm on June 10, 2020.

She would like to see fewer police officers in De Pere schools and police funds spread out to other social services, such as schools and mental health services."I would be here rain and shine just like anyone else here because Black Lives Matter," she said. "Black lives and the black people in our communities do not have justice and face oppression in so many forms, and today we're fighting oppression from the police and police brutality.”Giovanni Vega of Green Bay called the protest "beautiful.”"Honestly, I haven't really been keeping up with the protests that have been happening in Green Bay,” Vega said. "So when a friend told me that there was something going on over here, I couldn't stand around and do nothing at home.”Buy PhotoBlack Lives Matter protesters march to demand an end to police brutality on June 10, 2020, in De Pere, Wis.

I think it's great we're getting a lot of support out here for things that are national news, but it affects people here. I know it makes some people uncomfortable, but all these things are for the right reasons," Knott said.Contact Nusaiba Mizan at (920)-431-8310 or nmizan@gannett.com.
