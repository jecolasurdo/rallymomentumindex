She stepped back, and community leaders and strangers alike placed their hands on her in prayer. A prominent civil rights attorney implored the crowd of almost 100 people on Wednesday afternoon to send information that could result in an indictment of the officer. Another activist had one simple request. "Say her name,” the activist, Ernest Walker, yelled. "Pam Turner,” the crowd chanted. "Say her name,” he repeated. "Pam Turner!” the crowd responded, over and over. Turner's daughter, Chelsie Rubin, collapsed her head on the shoulder of a friend nearby. Her 44-year-old mother died Monday night during a confrontation with an unnamed officer, who police said shot the woman after she struck him with his own Taser. The crowd gathered at the behest of Houston-based rapper Trae Tha Truth and civil rights attorney Lee Merritt, who said they were saddened and outraged after watching the now-viral video of Turner's death. The two leaders first met in an east Houston parking lot to call for charges against the officer, an 11-year-veteran of the police department, and then migrated to the apartment complex where Turner died. "I don't want this to be a situation where it gets swept under the rug,” Trae Tha Truth said. Baytown police spokesman Lt. Steve Dorris later on Wednesday said Chief Keith Dougherty had asked the Texas Rangers to take over the officer-involved shooting investigation in their place. The local agency's Internal Affairs Division will continue its own review of the incident, Dorris said in a written statement. "While Chief Dougherty has full faith and confidence in his investigators, he has also heard and understands the public demands for transparency,” Dorris continued. "He wants the family of Ms. Turner and the community to have the same faith and confidence in their police department, and the officers who work hard every day to keep our community safe.” The Harris County District Attorney's Office will bring the case to a grand jury, spokesman Dane Schiller said. "Our Civil Rights Division was at the scene,” he said. "All the evidence will be reviewed by our specialized prosecutors and presented to a grand jury to determine whether to issue an indictment. We do this in every officer-involved shooting.” Merritt, who is working with Turner's family and their attorney, said he believes the officer broke protocol in Turner's attempted arrest. The woman had paranoid schizophrenia, and should have been treated differently, he said. Merritt is known for his representation in several high-profile cases, including the death of Botham Jean, an unarmed 26-year-old who was shot by a former Dallas police officer in his apartment in September 2018. "Certain procedures should have taken place,” Merritt said, of the encounter between Turner and the officer. "You don't approach someone that you know to be suffering from a mental health condition the same way that you approach the average citizen.” Dorris has said the department will investigate whether Turner had mental health issues, and whether that was known to the officer at the time. The confrontation began around 10:30 p.m. Monday night, when the police officer spotted Turner while on patrol at The Brixton Apartments at 1601 Garth Road. He had "prior dealings” with the woman and was trying to arrest her on an active warrant, Dorris said. Turner began struggling with him, and the policeman deployed his Taser. Turner managed to get the weapon from him and struck him once, after which he pulled his firearm and fired five rounds, Dorris said. Moments before the gunfire, Turner yelled that she was pregnant, according to the video footage. Police said that an autopsy found she wasn't with child. Turner is already being villainized by police and in the media, said Minister Abdul Haleem Muhammad, of Mosque 45. One of her warrants stemmed from an alleged assault of an apartment manager who had previously posted an eviction notice on her door. He indicated that a racial element could be at play. Turner was African-American. "This is almost déjà vu and Groundhog Day all over again,” Muhammad said. "Regardless of whether the people are armed or not armed, we die and the police walk.” Turner's daughter, Chelsie Rubin, declined to comment at the protest. The Rev. Al Sharpton, founder and president of the civil rights organization National Action Network, announced Wednesday that he will pay for Turner's funeral. "This is another alarming example of the unacceptable use of force exercised by law enforcement against Black and Brown Americans,” he said. "Our hearts go out to Ms. Turner's family and we at NAN will fight for a full and transparent investigation into the circumstances of this heartbreaking tragedy.” The officer has been placed on a 3-day administrative leave, which is standard after officer-involved shootings, Dorris said. No decision had been made about his employment status. He was wearing a body camera during the shooting, the footage of which has not been released, Dorris said. The video that the public has already seen left many with more questions than answers. The officer appeared to have options, evidenced by footage showing him stepped away before firing the shots, Merritt said. In the video, Turner appeared to be on the ground before it cuts off. "There is no set of facts that I can imagine that would provide a justification for the use of force in this situation,” he said. Person after person at the apartment complex on Wednesday echoed Merritt's thoughts about why any force was necessary. "She was already on the ground,” Raquel Cuellar, 26, said, citing the video. "It's just something tragic.” Dennis Chachere, a 28-year-old former corrections officer, said he often feels discouraged seeing lack of indictments in other officer-involved shootings across the country. "Knowing statistics, nothing ever happens,” Chachere, of east Houston, said. "That's why we've got to keep this presence.” samantha.ketterer@chron.com Samantha KettererFollow Samantha on:sam_kettSamantha Ketterer is a reporter on the Houston Chronicle's breaking news team.
