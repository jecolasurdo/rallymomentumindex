Middleton-Doctor, one of the shooting's victims, was among those who participated in the march. "My ancestors were trotted through this market, their bodies on the ground of this Meeting Street, this marketplace,” Middleton told the Associated Press. "To know the trail of blood flows from here, it flows straight to Mother Emmanuel, it breaks my heart.” Louise Brown holds up a sign on June 20, 2015, during the "March for Black Lives” march in Charleston, S.C.

Many of the demonstrators said they believe the flag is an outdated symbol widening racial divisions.
