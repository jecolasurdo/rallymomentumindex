WALLACE/TIMES-DISPATCH Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save The statue of Jefferson Davis on Monument Avenue in Richmond was torn down late Wednesday night.The statue of the president of the Confederacy was toppled shortly before 11 p.m. and left on the ground at the intersection of Davis and Monument avenues. Richmond police were quickly on the scene. A tow truck showed up around 11:30 p.m. to take the statue away.While the statue was being loaded onto the tow truck a onlooker could be heard saying "What a time to be alive. What a time to be in Richmond."Once it was on the truck other bystanders said "Take it to the dump" and "Throw it in the lake." The vandalism of the statue comes nearly two weeks into protests against police brutality against black Americans, sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. It comes a day after the Christopher Columbus statue in Byrd Park was pulled down by protesters, and on the same night that demonstrators pulled down four statues from a Confederate monument in Portsmouth.On Saturday, a Confederate statue honoring Confederate Gen. Williams Carter Wickham was torn down in Richmond's Monroe Park.The Jefferson Davis monument and the J.E.B. Stuart monument were both dedicated in 1907. Davis' widow, Varina, had initially picked a site in Monroe Park for her husband's memorial, but the cornerstone was later moved to Monument Avenue against her wishes.(This is breaking news.

IMG_3895.JPG The Jefferson Davis statue was pulled down onto Monument Avenue on Wednesday, June 10, 2020. jeff davis statue Pastor, police major attempt to start dialogue with protesters at Lee statueEarlier: Two events congregated on opposite sides of the Lee monument on Wednesday night — the 381 Movement's nightly protests against police brutality, which are now in their second week, and B.R.I.D.G.E., an event developed by Pastor Clay Cofield from Spirit of Fire Cathedral in Glen Allen to create dialogue between police and the people in the Richmond community.Maj. Sybil El-Amin Jones, a member of the Richmond Police Department who is in charge of the 3rd and 4th precincts, was invited by Cofield to speak to the crowd.They spoke on the west side of the monument in front of an audience of about 150 spectators. A voter registration booth was set up next to audio equipment, which amplified music from a small band and the voices of vocalists singing spiritual music before the speakers took the microphone."We've got to have a voice, and there's no need for us to shout about stuff if we're not going to make any decisions to change the stuff that we're shouting about,” Cofield said, pointing to the voter registration booth before turning the microphone over to El-Amin Jones. El-Amin Jones said that she has wanted to join protests over the killing of George Floyd, which have enveloped the city of Richmond for nearly two weeks, but cannot do so because of her responsibilities."I want to say that what you see on TV is not your Richmond Police Department. What you see happening in Minneapolis is not what is happening in the city of Richmond,” she said.El-Amin Jones, who grew up in Richmond and teaches cultural diversity training for RPD, said many malpractices highlighted by protesters — chokeholds, officers failing to use body cameras and the handling of mental health issues, among others — don't exist in RPD."I am giving you the utmost respect. I love the city of Richmond, I have dedicated my life to the city of Richmond,” she said."So has our chief, so has our command staff, and so have our officers. Call us to the table, we will come.”To Cofield, the protests that have enveloped Richmond and other cities across America over the past week and a half have taken the wrong approach to addressing the issue of police brutality.Referencing the protest organized by the 381 Movement, which was also congregated by the Lee monument, Cofield said, "On one side of the statue, you have yelling, and cursing and anger and attitude. On the other side of the statue, you have answers.”As El-Amin Jones and Cofield finished speaking, many spectators crossed over to the east side of the monument to hear leaders of 381 Movement speak. Some attendees at the 381 Movement's protest felt as though the B.R.I.D.G.E. event was an attempt to upstage the movement at large.After a handful of speakers called for a continuation of the marches and protests against police brutality and systemic racism, the group, which had by then swelled to a couple hundred, began marching down Monument Avenue toward VCU with chants of "F-12” and "Black Lives Matter.”***The Richmond Department of Parks, Recreation and Community Facilities says the statue of Christopher Columbus has been removed from the lake at Byrd Park, where protesters threw it Tuesday night.Tamara Jenkins, spokeswoman for the department, said the statue was recovered Wednesday morning. She said she could not disclose where it was taken. She said she had not received any report on possible damage.Richmond police said Wednesday there were no arrests at the park related to the incident.On Wednesday afternoon, Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney tweeted about the Columbus statue being torn down."The atrocities inflicted upon indigenous people by Christopher Columbus are unconscionable. That's why the city began observing Indigenous Peoples' Day, not Columbus Day, in 2019. But the decision & action to remove a monument should be made in collaboration w/ the community,” Stoney said."Working with Richmond's History and Culture Commission, we are establishing a process by which Richmonders can advocate for change to the figures we place on public pedestals across our city in a legal and peaceful way.”In Portsmouth on Wednesday, protesters beheaded and then pulled down four statues that were part of a Confederate monument, according to local media reports.The demonstrators used a tow rope to topple the figures as police watched. Protesters spray painted the monument and used tools to remove the heads. According to reporters at the scene, a man was struck in the head by a falling statue.Earlier in the day, protesters covered the statues with sheets and bags, several hours after City Council members had a meeting about relocating the monument.Mayor John Rowe proposed allocating $100,000 to remove the monument and possibly relocate it to a local cemetery. -- HIDE VERTICAL GALLERY ASSET TITLES -- IMG_1256.jpeg IMG_2622.JPG IMG_2623.JPG IMG_2625.JPG EaM3k-2XYAAz2Oq.jpg The Jefferson Davis statue was pulled down onto Monument Avenue on Wednesday, June 10, 2020.

Those that want the statues down, fine, but we are still a nation of laws. Or do we now pick and choose which laws to follow? Keep in mind, the next "mob rulers" may not be on your side.

Lee, who was called to Washington by Lincoln, and offered the command of a new army being formed to force the seceded states back into the Union ..... but Lee. even being against secession, refused, because "he could take no part in an invasion of the Southern States, and especially his home state of Olde Virginny .... Or as interpreted, and soon to be rewritten, by the left, to suit their version of things ...... "Lee fought to keep his beloved slaves”.Give the idiots time, and their future failures will give them yet another reason to tear down stuff for purposes of uniting the country they love. Period.

Stoney was at a victory party while this was going on .... celebrating the fact now that he and the rest of the liberal council will not only not have to vote to tear down Monument Ave, but where to put the remains of all those old dead white men that have possessed their minds since they became victims, although dead these many years.This is another part of history the left will not be able to erase ..... Period. Report Add Reply Drake D Butler Jun 11, 2020 12:22am just saved the taxpayers a WHOLE lot of money! Report Add Reply James McIntyre Jun 11, 2020 3:58am Drake , I think the Hoodlums and thugs that are doing this destruction should be held accountable for their actions and be both incarcerated and forced to pay for the damages incurred . Violence and destruction is Not a Peaceful protest ! Hope you're proud of what you and your comrades have accomplished ! Report Add Reply RICK FISK Jun 11, 2020 7:06am What is it going to take? Someone getting crushed like the person in Portsmouth? Felony vandalism. Report Add Reply Hal Jones Jun 11, 2020 7:22am Yep...The city can take the statues down or the people will do it for them... Report Add Reply William Howard Jun 11, 2020 7:45am Oh, you too, supporting these thugs destroying property and breaking the law. Hal. you are not fooling anyone, you support these riots, looting, and shooting at policeman, you're right there with them as a cheerleader! Report Add Reply Hal Jones Jun 11, 2020 9:43am Howard,You don't know me from Adam. I do support the protestors. I do know that police departments are rife with institutional racism. I do know that the protests have been 98% peaceful and that White Nationalists have posed as protestors and incited violence.....I am sad for the property damage...But it doesn't compare to cops killing a man on video.. Report William Howard Jun 11, 2020 7:42am What do you think about what the insurance rates are going to do? These poor small businesses will have to pay higher rates but you liberals don't care. By your statement, you are supporting vandalism and destruction of property! What happened to your peaceful protesters, like vampires at night they turn into Thugs! Report Add Reply Hal Jones Jun 11, 2020 7:55am George Floyd lies in his grave....When you folks address the issue that caused that then then the protests will stop. Spare me you wails about property damage... Report Add Reply jim peace Jun 11, 2020 10:09am Hal And the cop that killed him is going to face a murder charge, as well he should. Call off your vandal outlaws and let the city follow the law and take them down. Report Steve Powell Jun 11, 2020 8:26am And only eight shot? And none by the police? Your simple mind just cannot calculate the cost of this. And how many blacks in Richmond pay any taxes. BLM should stand for Blacks Lack Morality Report Add Reply Hal Jones Jun 11, 2020 9:44am Powell,Those shootings had nothing to do with the protestors...That banner is on the top of the RTD today....Do try and keep up Report Add Reply steve edmondson Jun 11, 2020 6:40pm Oh, so it was just another summer night in RVA? Be interesting to watch what becomes of this once fine city. Report Jason Todd Jun 10, 2020 11:52pm Go go go go go go go who's next? Report Add Reply Rick Stevenson Jun 10, 2020 11:42pm Richmond has descended into anarchy. Law enforcement is nowhere to be seen. Stoney is complicit. Many will now desert the city. And for good reason. The mob rules. Report Add Reply Get Fit Jun 10, 2020 11:51pm Dude there are police in several of the pictures... Report Add Reply jim peace Jun 11, 2020 7:25am After the statue was down. No effort at all to prevent. Dude. Report Add Reply Get Fit Jun 11, 2020 10:48am Bro, they can't post police at every monument. The monuments were coming down in July, all this did was save the city some money. Report TRACY PETERS Jun 11, 2020 7:43am Dude ..... read and you will see that the police were their after the fact. Duh, and period. Report Add Reply William Howard Jun 11, 2020 7:48am Well DUDE, you sound like a whiny millennial! DUDE, if you could read it was after the fact! Report Add Reply Get Fit Jun 11, 2020 10:49am Brah, I sound like a "whiny millenial"? You're the snowflake that keeps crying over people having beliefs that are different than yours. I am against participation trophies, especially for the civil war. Report Drake D Butler Jun 11, 2020 1:06am Anarchy, Rick? Hardly. Hyperbole much?

Report Add Reply William Howard Jun 11, 2020 7:49am I didn't see anybody murdered by police but there were thugs shooting police, right Hal? Report Add Reply Hal Jones Jun 11, 2020 8:15am Howard,You should review the George Floyd video again...Murder by Police....So tell me how many Richmond police were shot in the protests last night? The answer is none....The police are the thugs in most cities...Beating, Tear gassing and shooting innocents with pepper balls, attacking journalists and proving that they have systemic racism in police departments nationwide..... Report Bob GREENE Jun 10, 2020 11:36pm Richmond City Government, City police and the Commonwealth of Virginia are giving their permission for vandalism, riot, looting. A complete background of government.I don't care if the statue of Jefferson Davis is removed. He isn't a Virginian and presided over a losing effort. What I care about is that elected leaders are aiding and abetting vandalism and destruction. It is obvious they will not protect the citizens of Richmond. Just keep the anarchy in the city with its incompetent and feckless leadership. Report Add Reply James McIntyre Jun 11, 2020 3:59am Amen and Amen Report Add Reply Bill Noth Jun 11, 2020 6:23am The progress Richmond experienced in the last 20 years has been destroyed in two weeks. Many of the businesses already struggling with the COVID lockdown are now struggling with rioting and looters and will never return. Good luck with that meals tax, Levar, because there will not be any restaurants to charge it or diners to pay it. Report Add Reply Hal Jones Jun 11, 2020 7:26am Greene,All you law and order types had jack to say when police killed George Floyd so step off....In the meantime the sooner these statues to traitors come down the sooner things will calm down...

Richmond in is a state of anarchy and under siege ! Report Add Reply Hal Jones Jun 11, 2020 7:28am McIntyre,Lions and Tigers and anarchy...Oh My...A statue was pulled down and you wail like a Trump Bunker B***ch....The city is not under siege.... Report Add Reply William Howard Jun 11, 2020 7:52am If the thugs would stay off the streets and cease their criminal activity you would have a case but Hal, the evidence is there! Report William Howard Jun 11, 2020 7:50am Good point James! Report Add Reply Get Fit Jun 11, 2020 10:51am "Anarchy" has your daily life really been affected? Not your feelings, but your actual life.
