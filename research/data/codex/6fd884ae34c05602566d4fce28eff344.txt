Here are the players who protested in Week 12:Philadelphia Eagles: Safety Malcolm Jenkins raised a fist over his head during the national anthem before Monday night's game against the Packers. He has been protesting since Week 2 against the Chicago Bears. Cornerback Ron Brooks typically protests with him, but has not been present on the sideline the past five games after undergoing surgery to repair a ruptured quad tendon. Jenkins recently discussed at length his reasons for protesting. -- Tim McManusSeattle Seahawks: Seahawks players linked arms during the anthem just as they've done for every regular-season game this season. -- Sheil KapadiaSan Francisco 49ers: With safety Eric Reid on injured reserve with a torn biceps, 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and outside linebacker Eli Harold were the only 49ers to kneel during the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Dolphins.

WilliamsLos Angeles Rams: Defensive end Robert Quinn raised his right fist during the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Saints, as has been his custom since the start of the regular season. Quinn said he will continue to do so, regardless of whatever backlash he receives on social media. Said Quinn: "People have the right to voice their opinion. It's up to you whether you listen to it or not. If people feel bad or feel upset about making a stand, that's their personal opinion and judgment. At the end of the day, I'm just standing up for what I believe is right." -- Alden Gonzalez FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmail
