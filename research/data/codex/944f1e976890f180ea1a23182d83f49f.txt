Viewpoint: Why racism is worse in the US than Europe Woman sacked after calling police on black man Minnesota Governor Tim Walz activated the state's national guard troops on Thursday, declaring the situation a "peacetime emergency".

Four police officers involved in the arrest have already been fired.The incident echoes the case of Eric Garner, who was placed in a police chokehold in New York in 2014.

'This is how they're going to listen'Analysis by Jessica Lussenhop, BBC senior staff writer, MinneapolisThe morning after a violent and destructive night across this city, the air was thick with acrid smoke as buildings continued to smoulder. Fresh graffiti covers nearly every wall, sign and surface. Bus stop shelters are skeletal with their glass walls completely shattered. This thriving commercial corner of the city has taken on the look of a war zone. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Police fired tear gas and protesters threw rocks Much of the worst damage was concentrated around the Minneapolis Police Department's 3rd Precinct, where the officers involved in the killing of George Floyd are believed to have worked.At least 100 demonstrators gathered once again this morning, shouting at a line of silent, helmeted police officers blocking the entrance to the precinct's parking lot. Armed officers watched from the roof.The car park of a looted Target was strewn with debris from inside the store, and people were still freely going in and out of smashed windows and doors, though it appeared to be more out of curiosity than anything. Everyone seemed agog at the extent of the damage. And it was indiscriminate. Banks, cheque cashing shops and liquor stores were hit, but the windows of a public library branch were also smashed in, the bookshelves and reading desks scattered with glittering fragments. The classrooms of a charter school in the same strip mall complex as the Target were under several inches of water, as a security alarm droned on from somewhere. Anger in the streets was palpable. Periodically there were shouts and wails. It seems a foregone conclusion that demonstrations will continue for days if not weeks, and further violence could follow. As one protester told me: "It's sad. But this is how they're going to listen." What's the reaction?Mr Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, told CNN on Thursday he hoped the officers involved got the death penalty."I'm never gonna get my brother back," he said. "We need justice."Speaking through tears, he said the officers who "executed my brother in broad daylight" must be arrested and that he was "tired of seeing black men die".He added that he understood why protesters were lashing out.

She called for protesters to act peacefully, and for police to "take utmost care not to inflame the current situation even more".President Donald Trump "was very upset" when he saw the footage of Mr Floyd's death, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters on Thursday."He wants justice to be served."A number of celebrities and athletes, including John Boyega, LeBron James, Beyonce, and Justin Bieber, have also expressed outrage over the incident.Actor John Boyega rails against racismWhat happened to George Floyd?Officers responding to reports of the use of counterfeit money approached Mr Floyd in his vehicle on Monday.According to police, he was told to step away from the car, physically resisted officers and was handcuffed. The police statement noted his apparent "medical distress".Video of the incident does not show how the confrontation started.

In a statement to local media, the union said "now is not the time to rush to judgment"."We must review all video. We must wait for the medical examiner's report."
