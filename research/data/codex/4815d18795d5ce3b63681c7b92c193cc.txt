WatchWorkforce AllianceYale EventsYMCAYouth ContinuumSubscribe to the NHI Newsletter Protesters Crash Mayor's Neighborhood To Press For Cop's Firingby Sam Gurwitt | Nov 7, 2019 8:51 am (10) Comments | Commenting has been closed | E-mail the AuthorPosted to: Hamden, Legal Writes Forty-five minutes after the sun had set, about 25 protesters gathered outside Hamden Mayor Curt Leng's house to disrupt the silence setting over his chilly Ridge Hill neighborhood — and to ask Leng to end his own.The protesters were on the sidewalk outside of Leng's house Wednesday evening, as they had promised they would be at another protest last week, to demand that Leng speak up about the shooting of Stephanie Washington and Paul Witherspoon by Hamden Police Officer Devin Eaton in April. They called on Leng to recommend Eaton's immediate termination.In October, State's Attorney Patrick Griffin released his office's report on the incident, which brought felony charges against Eaton. Eaton was arrested and put on unpaid administrative leave. He has pleaded not guilty. Since the April shooting, protesters have continued to demand that the department fire Eaton. The department has said that while the state's attorney's investigation was underway, it could not interview key witnesses, including Eaton, and therefore could not continue to conduct its own internal affairs investigation. When Griffin's report came out and Eaton was arrested, Hamden Acting Chief of Police John Cappiello (pictured) announced that he would wrap up his investigation into whether Eaton had violated department rules within 30 days.Cappiello told the Independent Wednesday that he does not have any updates on the investigation, and that he remains committed to completing it within the 30-day timeline he promised.When protesters marched to Leng's office in April to demand action, Leng told them that he had "seen enough to recommend termination,” but that he would have to wait for the state and local investigations to be complete. He has not made any official recommendation since then. Wednesday night protesters huddled together in a line facing press cameras. One by one they took the microphone to speak.Protesters had made a poster with an image from Eaton's body camera footage on it. "Your police disturbed our neighborhood,” read the caption across the bottom. "Now we are here to disturb yours.”A light or two was on in the house, but no one came out. Leng told the Independent that he was not there. "Mayor Curt Leng where you at!” shouted People Against Police Brutality Organizer Kerry Ellington. "We want the officer discharged. We want the Hamden Police Commission to respect the public that it's supposed to be working for. We want Hamden to end its policing in New Haven.”Justin Farmer (pictured below), who about 22 hours earlier had won reelection to the Hamden Legislative Council representing southern Hamden's Newhall area, implored his fellow leaders to speak up."I've been in every single community over the last two years, and spoke to community members about trees, about planting, about leaves, about the sidewalks, about the curbs, but for some reason, supposed leaders can't speak on issues like police brutality,” he said. "Leaders can't speak on generational poverty. Leaders can't speak on the trauma that's going on in our community.” In the last few weeks, he said, two shootings have taken place in or near his district. "None of the supposed leaders could speak on it,” he said. "Because they don't see those issues as their issues. Crime doesn't happen in their community. The issues of racial profiling don't happen in their community. But God forbid somebody doesn't have leaves picked up. It's my job to go and listen to those complaints.”Farmer told the Independent that his main goal is to enact structural changes in the police department. He said he would like a management team where representatives of the department meet with various neighborhood organizations periodically, for example."I want [Leng] to say he's seen enough to see a civilian review board,” he said to the crowd. "I want him to say I've seen enough that we need to come up with a plan. I want him to say I've seen enough to be out here, and not be a coward in his house.”"I respect every person's right to protest and make their voices heard,” Leng wrote in a statement. "I've listened to the protestors and certainly worked to ensure that they have been treated fairly as they should be. This is a most serious matter. Bringing a protest to a public official's private home, in my humble opinion, isn't the best practice. It inevitably involves someone's family, and even their neighbors, into a public issue, which they aren't involved with and didn't sign up for. There are many more productive ways to have public discourse. That said, I respect their right to have the protest. I don't respect a fellow official using the time to make knowingly untrue statements about me personally and about our community.”In the last few months, noted Spring Glen Church Reverend Jack Perkins Davidson, every mayoral candidate said that "we are one Hamden ... But it's pretty clear that some people get served better than others in Hamden. It's pretty clear that there's some division in Hamden; there's some segregation in Hamden; that white people live in a different Hamden than black and brown people. And the only way to become one people isn't to say over and over we're one Hamden and ignore the concerns of black and brown people. The only way to become one Hamden is to lift up the needs of those who have been marginalized and put in harm's way. Rodney Williams (pictured above), the uncle of Paul Witherspoon, also spoke. "Paul is a Hamden resident,” he said. "And we're asking right now, the Hamden mayor, treat my nephew like he was white. 'Cause I'm going to be clear with you, ok, if my nephew was white, would that officer still be an officer? I doubt that.”Williams said that until Eaton is no longer an officer in Hamden, his family and community are not going to heal. It's hard, he said, to watch his nephew become a symbol, but perhaps something will come of it. "Hopefully what happened to him won't happen again. Hopefully he's a symbol of future change.” Tags: Devin Eaton, Curt Leng, Justin Farmer, Rodney Williams, Jack Perkins Davidson, protest Your Email: Subject: Message: Sent: Jun 19, 2020 1:49 pmPlease enter the word you see in the image below: submit ×Share this story with others.Post a CommentCommenting has closed for this entryCommentsposted by: 1644 on November 7, 2019 9:08amEllington's jacket led me to this: https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/gloves-are-off-in-lawsuit-over-winter-parkasposted by: Noteworthy on November 7, 2019 9:34amMob Comes Home To Roost Notes:1. You protest too much.2. Respect the process.3. Do unto others as you would have done to you. You want somebody protesting outside your house? If you answer yes, please post your address.4. Rodney Williams - The process would be the same whether the alleged victim is white or black. It requires state investigation, then local adjudication.5. Kerry Ellington's continued divisive and disruptive actions are not helping in any way, shape or form. People who mindlessly follow and bellow accomplish nothing.posted by: thecove on November 7, 2019 11:17am"cause I'm going to be clear with you,ok, if my nephew was white, would that officer still be an officer? I doubt that.” Really? Race has nothing to do with due process. Stop the excuses. The shooting was bad. The shooting was wrong. But apparently it didn't stop your nephew from engaging police in a pursuit a few short weeks later. Maybe your family should be more focused on getting him the help he needs to remain on the right side of the law. Don't make the mistake of getting involved with Kerry Ellington and her band of relevance-seeking misfits, you're credibility will lower to their standards.posted by: Fitzy14 on November 7, 2019 12:26pmThese unhinged protestors who dont respect the process set in place by laws and union contracts are making me hope the officer is found not guilty and returns to dutyposted by: HamdenMom on November 7, 2019 1:43pmCompletely disrespectful and wrong to go to the Mayor's home. His wife and child do not deserve that. Invasion of privacy.posted by: thecove on November 7, 2019 2:12pm@HamdenMomYou're absolutely right. Unfortunately, we are dealing with a group that has no idea how to conduct themselves, ever. I'm quite sure any civil rights leader (and I have spoken with some who agree) would be embarrassed by their actions, past and present. Thankfully, they are a very small minority with the vast majority of the city (with the exception of the criminals) viewing them as a joke. Even Emma Jones keeps them at more than arms length. Hopefully they'll grow up someday. I often wonder what these people will do when they need the police...run? fight? hide? Shows over folks, so is your 15 minutes of fame that never occurred.posted by: cunningham on November 7, 2019 3:11pmNonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored. My citing the creation of tension as part of the work of the nonviolent resister may sound rather shocking. But I must confess that I am not afraid of the word "tension.” ... The purpose of our direct action program is to create a situation so crisis packed that it will inevitably open the door to negotiation....I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to "order” than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: "I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action”; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a "more convenient season.”...Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.- MLK, Letter from a Birmingham Jailposted by: DwightAndHowe on November 7, 2019 3:48pmMaybe NHI should stop giving them publicity...posted by: DK314 on November 8, 2019 8:42amI am strong believer of our constitution and the rights it affords citizens of the United States. I understand their concerns for swift action against the Hamden Officer. Yet what they don't seem to understand are the CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS and LAWS afforded to him, like them or not, its a process, in fact its called DUE PROCESS. He is afforded that right just like ANYONE arrested.. END OF STORY. However, once a group of protesters decides to bring their message and concerns, to an individual's residence or my residence,....SORRY ALL BETS ARE OFF NOW,...you have crossed the line disturbing the privacy and safety of my family. YOUR concerns have nothing to do with the mayor's family. With that said, I'm willing to be they did not have a permit to gather/protest in front of the mayor's residence, therefore I would have them ALL arrested for Disorderly Conduct. PERIOD.......posted by: DMH464 on November 8, 2019 9:31am@DK314Couldn't have said it better myself.Let's be transparent by saying that we all know that Eaton will no longer be a police officer in Hamden and dare I say anywhere else but just like ANYONE else there is a process and it will be followed. After this "circus” leaves town and all is said no one is going to want to touch this kid.I do find it funny how Witherspoon, great kid, is still out there committing crimes as this plays out while Eaton is vilified for his actions.What everyone's favorite activist for hire Kerry Ellington either fails or just doesn't care to understand is that he has rights like everyone else and if the city doesn't handle this incident correctly he can bring a case for his civil rights being violated just as I'm sure the other half will be doing.As far as going to someone's house/neighborhood that's pretty classless but again it's Kerry Ellington so I'm not too surprised there. I'm sure your helping your "cause” by disturbing the entire block, which had s&@t to do with the shooting. All I can say is what goes around comes around. I wouldn't be surprised if one day a protest comes shaking down Ellington's block in the night and sets up shop in front of her home.Lastly you can protest all you want but it will take as long as it takes and they will make a decision on their timetable not yours no matter what they tell you.
