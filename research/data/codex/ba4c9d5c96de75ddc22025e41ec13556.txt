His death sparked protests and riots in Baltimore over police brutality and treatment of African American men throughout the weekend and into Monday. People in several cities, including Chicago, Oakland and New York City, have held events in solidarity."There's broad community opposition to police violence, which is an issue people in Albuquerque are familiar with,” said Chris Banks, a coordinator with the ANSWER coalition. "We feel a special responsibility to show our solidarity with communities in Baltimore, New York City, Ferguson and everywhere we've seen protests.”The march shut down Central for about an hour and a half as marchers of all ages and backgrounds took to the streets waving signs and chanting "racist cops have got to go” and "what's the solution? Revolution!” Four ABQ Ride buses diverted their routes to avoid the protest, and police cruisers were posted along the route to block traffic.ADVERTISEMENTSkip ................................................................In the 13 months since the demonstrations that followed the police shooting of homeless camper James Boyd, Albuquerque activists have marched in solidarity for several African American who were killed by police.Banks said in some ways he's encouraged about the changes made within the Albuquerque Police Department over the past year, but he was quick to mention the charges against officer Cedric Greer for excessive use of force against a man at a hotel in late March."We have the officer that was just indicted for brutally beating and assaulting someone right in this neighborhood,” Banks said. "In the day-to-day operations, we haven't seen a transformation in policing.”Charles Powell, the president of Veterans for Peace in Albuquerque, said he wishes he could stop protesting but he has yet to see the change he desires."There are things that have happened along the way here in Albuquerque that have been encouraging, but there's still so much to be done,” said Powell. "I care about the young people. I have grandsons going to college in Minnesota and I care about them. I feel I've got to try to make the world better for them.” Subscribe now!
