And then, one man spoke up. "All lives matter. Not just black lives. Everybody's lives matter," said Vallejo resident Luis Blanco. "We can either come together, not divided with each other. What happened in Dallas wasn't right. Not just black lives matter. Remember that." Following the shootings of two black man by police in Louisiana and Minnesota, one man in retaliation to those shootings, opened fire on police in Dallas, killing five officers. "It's pretty sad that people create this divide, and I think we all need to come together," Blanco added. Protest organizer Leona Yohannes agrees. "Of course we do not condone any type of violence. This is a peaceful protest. What happened in Dallas is a tragedy," she said. The police presence at the mall and Cal Expo was consistent throughout the day and into the evening. The group speaker, who identified himself as Art, says his cousin was shot and killed by an officer last year in Kansas. He says the number of similar shootings around the country need to stop. "So we can talk about the issues that are affecting not only black people, but people of all races," he said. 38.601998-121.427293 Close Modal Suggest a Correction Your name(required) Your email(required) Report a typo or grammatical error(required) Submit Suggest a Correction Share this story More Local News Stories Elk Grove Boulevard closed in both directions near Wymark Drive due to fatal crash by FOX40 Web Desk / Jun 19, 2020 ELK GROVE, Calif.
