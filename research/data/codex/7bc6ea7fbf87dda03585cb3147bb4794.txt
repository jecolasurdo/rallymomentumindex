(WENY) – On Friday, health care professionals from the Arnot Ogden Medical Center in Elmira took part in the nationwide "White Coats for Black Lives” movement.The movement "encourages physicians, physician organizations, and medical institutions to publicly recognize racism as a public health issue”. It also calls for the end of racial inequality in the medical field as well as improve the "recruitment and support of Black, Latinx and Native American medical students”.Health care workers at Arnot Ogden took a knee both outside and in the medical center, as well as held up signs in support of the movement.The movement happened on the same day hundreds of people peacefully marched in Elmira, joining the national call for the end of racial injustice following the deaths of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor.Arnot President and CEO Jonathan Lawrence said, "We came together today to reflect on our responsibility as healthcare professionals to reaffirm our commitment to people of color in our community. The incidence of violence against people of color, especially members of the Black and African American community indicate this has become a national public health crisis. We must all take an active role, personally and professionally, for meaningful change to occur. We applaud our law enforcement agencies, community organizations and elected officials for facilitating peaceful demonstrations and ensuring the safety of all our community members.”This is Home AdvertisingNews TeamContact UsPrivacy PolicyTerms of UseFCC Public FolderEEO Public FilingJobsAll content © copyright WENY.WENY | 474 Old Ithaca Rd. | Horseheads, NY 14845-7212All Rights Reserved.
