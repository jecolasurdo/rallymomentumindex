Tim Fischer/Reporter-Telegram Photo: Tim Fischer/Midland Reporter-Telegram Counter protest: 'The Christians' show up to back the police 1 / 48 Back to Gallery A Black Lives Matter protest took an unexpected turn Sunday night when from the parking lot at Midland Park Mall one could hear, "Here comes the Christians.” The self-proclaimed Nino "America” led his counter protest to the BLM movement to back Midland police and offer his perspective on protests that resulted in violence and looting. "America” told the Reporter-Telegram he self-identifies as Nino "America” because he doesn't believe in labels, such as being a Hispanic or conservative. Although he made it clear, he is a Christian. That mattered during the evening back and forth with BLM protesters as he asked them why they were OK with abortions that killed blacks. He also said that as a "born-again Christian” it was important for the event to be non-violent. "I'll tell you right now, I will I'll let them beat me down because I don't believe in violence whatsoever.,” "America” said. "I'm a Christian.” As BLM protesters who are frustrated by the death of George Floyd, "America” said his frustration is from watching the fires set, damage done and looting taking place in riots across the nation. "I could not sleep last night, seeing my country being burned to smithereens, and criminals and hoodlums taking liquor and shoes out of stores and beating people to a pulp,” "America” said. "It's disgusting. And America's better than that.” Politics was part of the protest. The counter-protest included a flag supporting President Donald Trump and Making America Great Again, and their leader had a red hat that called for MAGA and a shirt with the stripes and stars of the American flag. "America” had previously protested against the Reporter-Telegram for coverage that he deemed wasn't fair to the president. "Oh, I don't consider myself nothing but an American,” he said. "I do not like labels. I'm not a minority. I'm not a Mexican. I am an American. And it's not very hard for me (to protest) because I'm a born-again Christian. I have a loud mouth, and the Lord Jesus Christ is my Savior. I don't fear the 'rona (coronavirus). I don't fear Black Lives Matter. I don't fear Antifa. I only fear God.” Stay Connected Top Jobs Latest Stories Ector County reports 7th coronavirus-related death Rangers investigating in-custody death at Ector County jail Petitions created to keep Lee High School name Robert E.
