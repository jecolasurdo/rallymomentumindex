O'Connell and Marwa Eltaguori Chicago Tribune | Jul 12, 2016 | 8:24 AM For the fifth consecutive day, crowds of demonstrators gathered downtown Monday to protest police violence against African-Americans. A sit-in in Millennium Park organized by Chicago high school students was followed by a rally in Federal Plaza and a march that clogged traffic into the early evening as hundreds of protesters wound their way through sweltering downtown streets. Advertisement "We have to keep saying black lives matter because society shows us otherwise," said Eva Lewis, 17, a Walter Payton College Prep student who organized the early afternoon sit-in. "We're not anti-police, we're anti-racism." Holding signs and placing black tape over their mouths, the sit-in participants filled the grassy pavilion in the northwest corner of the park, drawing the attention of tourists and motorists on Michigan Avenue.

(Brandon Chew/Chicago Tribune) "The push was for this to happen on Saturday, but we decided to do it today because I think the protests need to be happening more often, not just when the fire starts," said another organizer, 16-year-old Maxine Wint of Kenwood Academy. "I think it's important for us to speak out against police violence and gun violence and to talk about how the two are linked together." Protests have been held in several cities nationwide following two fatal police shootings in Baton Rouge, La., and suburban St. Paul, Minn. Those shootings were followed Thursday by the sniper killings of five officers and the wounding of seven more in Dallas during a protest over police brutality. In Chicago, protesters have organized daily demonstrations since Thursday. Breaking News Shouts of 'black lives don't matter' as high bail set for protester A well-known local activist has been charged with hitting and trying to disarm a police officer during weekend protests sparked by last week's fatal shootings By Steve Schmadeke and Peter Nickeas Jul 12, 2016 | 5:30 AM Wint said it is important for young people to get involved in the civil rights movement and realize that issues of injustice and racism are present-day concerns, not relics from the past. She said students often talk about police shootings and violence in the neighborhood during classroom discussions about Afro-literature or when discussing plays by African-Americans. "We're still facing the same things as when my grandmother marched in the times of Martin Luther King," Wint said. Protesters baked in the sun as volunteers passed out bottles of water. At the edge of the pavilion, Chicago police officers kept watch. Politics Emanuel: 'Not a binary choice' between police, protesters Mayor Rahm Emanuel tried Monday to thread the needle between police protesters and police. By John Byrne Jul 11, 2016 | 4:24 PM After the sit-in, which lasted about two hours, the crowd marched to Federal Plaza for a rally led by Black Lives Matter Chicago and the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression. The crowd grew larger through the afternoon and came to include people with briefcases who had just left work and parents pushing strollers with young children. A black woman held a sign that read, "I hope I don't get killed for being black." On the other side of the crowd, a white woman held a sign that read, "White Silence Equals Consent." Frank Chapman, leader of the Chicago Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression, told the crowd that the organization doesn't condone the killing of police officers and called the Dallas shootings "a criminal act." But he demanded punishment for the officers responsible for the deaths of Philando Castile in St. Paul and Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, calling the nation's policing system "so hypocritical, it's pathetic." He assured those gathered that continued nonviolent demonstrations and organized resistance could put an end to police brutality. "That's how slavery ended," he later told reporters. "That's how Jim Crow ended." Dymeasha Gilleylen-Echols, 25, attended the sit-in, march and the demonstration outside the federal building after her younger cousin told her about it, as she "wanted to see what it's like." She said she was impressed by the diversity of the crowd. Advertisement "It just shows that everybody in the world isn't racist. Whites, blacks and Latinos want to come together and that's beautiful to see," she said. "This is my first time here but it won't be my last time."
