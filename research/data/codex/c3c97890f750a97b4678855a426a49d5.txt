Walsh's Dorchester home has City Hall officials mulling beefed-up security as the demonstrators vow to continue their battle in the escalating standoff over the Summer Games bid. "I think it's always a concern when there's a certain line that is crossed, when there is something outside his house. As of now, we're just kind of assessing if and what kind of security measures we take to make sure the mayor is safe,” a Walsh administration source told the Herald. "The mayor does not at all want to combat the right to protest by any means, obviously. Ideally, there aren't people outside his house at 4 a.m.,” the source said. Walsh was in Aspen, Colo., when his Tuttle Street house was targeted in an early morning protest by about 10 Black Lives Matter activists. "Good morning. Everyone on Tuttle Street, good morning,” said a voice-over to a minute-long video of the protest the group posted online yesterday. "We are residents representing Black Lives Matter Boston and the Safe Hub Collective gathered this morning outside the home of Mayor Marty Walsh in order to bring him a long overdue wake-up call. "We occupy this space this morning with our bodies and our voices because we love Boston and firmly believe that our city deserves better than the Olympic games,” the voice-over said. Daunasia Yancey, 23, founder and lead organizer of Black Lives Matter Boston, took credit for the demonstration but did not say whether the group would return to Walsh's home. She did say there would likely be further protests against the city's Olympic bid. "We are absolutely committed to doing everything in our power to prevent the Olympics from coming to Boston,” Yancey said. "We will absolutely continue to spread the message that we told: Boston does not deserve the pain that comes with the Olympics.” Another anti-Olympics group, No Boston 2024, said it supports the message Black Lives Matter is trying to send, but did not say how far it would take its protests. "We don't have any concrete things planned at the moment,” said Jonathan Cohn of No Boston 2024. "We support their message. We have worked with those groups in the past. We think that they have a strong message that they're putting forward: That hosting the Olympics would be particularly damaging.” He said no one from No Boston 2024 was "officially” at the brief protest outside Walsh's home, but added, "We see Black Lives Matter as allies. We agree with the message they're sending to the mayor.” Chris Dempsey with No Boston Olympics, which is separate from No Boston 2024, said his group won't protest or follow in Black Lives Matter's steps. "That's not our style. ... We think the best outcome for the city is going to be through a real conversation with ... where we weigh the pros and cons,” he said. "You're not going to see us doing anything like that or going to the mayor's house. ... That's not who we are. That's not who we're going to be.” Sign up for email newsletters Subscribe Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Most Popular Boston restaurants closing permanently due to coronavirus Massachusetts indoor dining can begin Monday after coronavirus closures, Baker says Charlie Baker's son's groping case remains up in the air Charlie Baker announces indoor dining, 50% office capacity can start Monday Massachusetts teachers union wants to abolish MCAS and take police out of schools upon reopening Charlie Baker quotes: Howie Carr Massachusetts town changes locks at gym that defied ban on fitness studios amid coronavirus List of Boston restaurants closed amid coronavirus pandemic Tags: Black Lives MatterMartin J.
