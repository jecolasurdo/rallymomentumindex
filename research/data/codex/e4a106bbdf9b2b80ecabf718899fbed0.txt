Abderholden News-Sun | Nov 11, 2016 | 5:16 PM Members of the Lake County Black Lives Matter group protested outside Warren Township High School on Almond Road in Gurnee Nov. 11, 2016, a day after racist graffiti was found in girls' bathroom that said "White's only" (sic). (Frank Abderholden / News-Sun) Lake County Black Lives Matter members protested in support of students at Warren Township High School on Almond Road Friday, drawing a mixed response after the school reported some incidents of people writing racist messages in bathrooms this week. On Wednesday, the words "White's only" (sic) were found on a bathroom stall door in a female washroom at the school's Almond Campus, according to District 121 Superintendent John Ahlgrim. The incident sparked a student sit-in and protest.

All the graffiti was removed, and the situation is being investigated by Gurnee Police, he said in an email to parents. "We're obviously saddened and upset," Ahlgrim said.

(Frank Abderholden / Lake County News-Sun) "Thank you so much for your support," she told Clyde McLemore, chairman of the group, as the protest took place near the school sign on Almond Road. "I appreciate you guys." Sandoval added that "kids were joking about how they did (the graffiti), and I reported it to the dean's office." "We're trying to organize a club or organization so this will not be ignored," Sandoval said, adding that she was at the protest on Thursday held inside the school by a relatively small group of students. According to Ahlgrim, the original group was joined by about 150 to 200 students. At that point, Almond Campus Principal Patrick Keeley addressed the students and allowed them to voice their concerns over the next period. Sandoval said "we are known for our diversity, but it's not really celebrated or acknowledged." She added that she feels school staff members really do care about the racism issue, and they are planning a meeting next week. Lake County Black Lives Matter members marched against racism Friday in Gurnee. Racist remarks were written on a girls bathroom wall at the high school's Almond Road Campus and three bathrooms at the O'Plaine Campus. (Frank Abderholden / Lake County News-Sun) McLemore said he had received calls from people who were intimidated by someone flying a rebel flag on their truck. "We just had eight years of a black president, and now we are going back to the 1950s and 'whites only,'" he said. "Some of these kids probably don't even know about Jim Crow. ... The writing on the bathroom walls was a disgrace." The half-dozen protesters on Friday chanted "this is what democracy looks like" and "let us end racism." One student drove past and yelled "white lives matter, too," and two women walking their dogs said the protest was childish and disgusting. Other students cheered the protesters and some took photographs with them. While the school district and McLemore had talked about the protest, there were ground rules. At first, protesters said they thought they could park in the school lot to go over to the sidewalk in front of the school sign on Almond Road and the public right-of-way to protest, but the school said no. "They have a right to protest, but they have no business here on school grounds," Ahlgrim said, adding that he had no opinion on the protest itself.

It was discovered by a student who reported it to a teacher, but before it could be addressed by the school, someone had photographed it and the image was spread on social media.
