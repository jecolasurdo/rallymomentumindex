Trevino, Detroit Free Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREHundreds of Eastern Michigan University students and faculty held a rally Wednesday in protest of racist graffiti sprayed on a campus building Monday, only a month after similar incidents on the Ypsilanti campus.The graffiti on Ford Hall has been removed.► Related: Reward doubled after more racist graffiti found at Eastern MichiganOutside the building Wednesday, faculty organized a rally to promote unity and understanding on a campus that students say is too often riled by racism. According to the website collegefactual.com, EMU's student body is 19.3% black.► Related: KKK, racial slurs painted on EMU building spark protest marchThe rally came after students organized an overnight sit-in at the school's Student Center, staying in the building from 10 p.m. Tuesday until 6 a.m. Wednesday. University police told the students they risked expulsion or other discipline for violating the student code of conduct, which prohibits students from being inside closed buildings — a move that EMU history professor Mark Higbee called "a rank absurdity” because the protest was peaceful."Turning a protest into a police matter is always a mistake,” Higbee told the gathering in a plaza where a statue of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. stands.Students and faculty chanted "Black lives matter,” and "Who's house? Our house.” They held Black Lives Matters signs and others that said "Pro Black” and "White Silence is the National Anthem.”Christine Neufeld, a professor of medieval literature, said faculty organized the rally to show students that they're "committed to making this an inclusive campus.” She said the faculty will work with students and university administrators to bring that about."It will not be business as usual,” Neufeld said.The graffiti discovered Monday morning marked the third time this school year that racist sayings have been spray-painted on buildings at EMU. In the first incident in September, "KKK" and racial slurs were discovered on walls of King Hall. That incident sparked a protest with more than 150 students marching to the home of university President James Smith.In another incident, a racial slur was found in the stairwell of Wise Hall the day after the first graffiti incident was discovered.University spokesman Geoff Larcom said the university is investigating the incidents. He said a reward for information about who spray-painted the graffiti has been doubled to $10,000."The university shares the concerns of the students and is appalled, angry and sadden by the acts of vandalism and racism,” Larcom said. "The investigation is ongoing. It's very important to bring the people who did this to justice.”Larcom said no students involved in the sit-in or other recent protests have been arrested, but it's not clear whether they will face disciplinary action.Neon Abraham, 19, and Sabah Channam, 20, of Canton, both students at Eastern Michigan University, attend rally at the university on Wednesday, Nov. 2, 2016. (Photo: Jessica J. Trevino, Detroit Free Press)Educators who attended the rally Wednesday talked about broader efforts to make the campus more diverse and inclusive, including a teach-in on Nov. 14 to encourage more classroom discussions about diversity, expanding curriculum to more strongly reflect African-American history and culture, and stronger efforts to diversify the faculty."It is time to break the barriers of silence,” said Ana Monteiro Ferreira, an associate professor of African-American studies.Biyi Akinlude, a program coordinator for Upward Bound at EMU, a program that works with high school students to prepare them for college, said that whoever is vandalizing the university with racist sayings is trying to divide the campus.No matter how often it happens, he said, "We will keep rising” to counter the acts.Demetrius Fields, 18, a freshman from Inkster, said he's frustrated that people are in denial about racism."People simply don't believe that racism still exists,” he said at the rally. "The problem of racism didn't end with the civil rights movement.”Nichelle Simone, 24, a theater arts graduate who coordinates communications for EMU's University Christian Fellowship, urged people to do more to help heal divisions and promote understanding."Just because you have black friends doesn't mean you're not racist,” she said. "Are you standing with us? Are you asking questions?”The rally was peaceful, with dozens of students taking turns speaking. One person showed up wearing a "Make America Great Again” hat, causing a brief stir about the appropriateness of wearing a hat bearing the campaign slogan of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Some people see Trump's views on immigration and other issues as being bigoted or racist.Krystle Dupree, 31, a senior from Detroit studying social work, said the tension on campus is thick. She said students of color fear going to class because of microaggressions — unintentional slights from white students who don't know much about black people — and fear campus police."Everyone wants to get along, but there are insidious pockets of people coming in and disrupting efforts to bridge gaps on campus,” Dupree said.Contact Matt Helms: 313-222-1450 or mhelms@freepress.com.
