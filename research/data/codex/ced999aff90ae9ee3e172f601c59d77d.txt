"Our mission here is to be able to have Santa Clarita, one of the more dominantly white cities in the United States to see that black lives are being murdered,” said Kiara Rassoli, who organized the Valencia protest. "We have a really peaceful city but that doesn't mean things aren't happening outside of this.” Matthew Furr, one of the protesters, joined the protest when he saw them from his car. "I was driving past, threw a fist out the window (in solidarity), parked my car and got out.” He believes this type of protest is the best course of action to make change in America. "The whole violence thing is one way to look at it, but you have to stay away from that,” he said. "It's going to take a while, but it gets there. Martin Luther King.” However, he believes race should not be a dominating factor in the country. Get live news updates about Santa Clarita by following KHTS on Facebook and KHTS on Twitter "It doesn't matter if you're black, white, whatever,” Furr said. "We're all people at the end of the day. God sees us as one people.” Meagan Furr, who arrived at the protest with Matthew, believes that this is a way to raise awareness to a larger societal problem. "All lives matter, but at the end of the day, we're focusing on the black lives because obviously everybody doesn't believe that black lives matter,” she said. The recent killings across the country, she said, emphasize this problem. "They say 'Oh he's resisting, he's doing the wrong thing,” Furr said. "That doesn't mean it's okay to put a bullet in somebody.” Do you have a news tip? Call us at (661) 298-1220, or drop us a line at community@hometownstation.com.

Reply joseph torp July 9, 2016 - 9:46 am at 9:46 am It would be so much better if the protesters stated that all lives matter there is going to be no closer to any problems if we keep separating color and race it's not just the Blacks thatdying by cops White and Mexicans are killed every day by them too. We are a nation under God and to God there's only one being created equal and that's the stand we need to make collect all we are a nation under God and to God there's only one being created equal and that's the stand we need To get America together as one and not divided it's time to come together in harmony Reply Joe July 9, 2016 - 5:25 pm at 5:25 pm These morons! Reply Chris K July 10, 2016 - 5:30 pm at 5:30 pm Who's claiming black lives don't matter? If you want to make a difference in the black community why don't you focus on the black community? Blacks are overwhelmingly killing blacks but unfortunately these protesters ignor there facts and instead get angry at law enforcement. "Black Lives Matter” and "Hands up Don't Shoot” are based on lies with the intent of dividing our communities and encourage lawlessness. But I guess facts won't get in the way of the lefts agenda, they never have. Reply Maddy July 11, 2016 - 11:22 am at 11:22 am Chris K.........Why you say Blacks are killing Blacks that may or may not be true but they didn't take the oath to Serve and Protect, the police officer did that, and that's a fact. Reply Chris K July 13, 2016 - 12:38 am at 12:38 am Maddy, Your response is emotional and has no facts. It is a fact that overwhelmingly blacks are killed by blacks. If you care about the truth you will research statistics and follow up on news reports of police shootings. The vast majority of police shootings are justified and are deemed so in the court of law. I know this to be true because I do my research and don't take the word of bumper stickers and race baters to be true. Do yourself a favor and do some research before making unscencical responses.
