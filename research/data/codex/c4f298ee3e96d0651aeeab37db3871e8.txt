Police said they arrested the protesters outside the ballpark Monday morning because they were blocking traffic and preventing vehicles from entering and leaving the site, delaying construction. Councilman Larry Deutsch was among them. Advertisement Deputy police Chief Brian Foley said that several of the protesters had been arrested in the past for taking part in similar protests. Bail was set at $5,000 for protesters arrested for the first time Monday, and those arrested for the second time were held with bail set at $10,000, Foley said.

He said there have been very few black and Hispanic workers on the site. [Breaking News] Police: New Haven teen killed by stray bullet while she slept inside her home » Advertisement According to Moral Monday, 6 percent of the jobs on the site are supposed to be set aside for minority contractors, but the group believes only 1 percent is being set aside for those workers. "The disparity of 83 percent black and brown city residents and only 1 percent of the stadium work going to our residents is unacceptable," Selders said in a statement. We demand that the city of Hartford revise its set-aside rules so that at least 50 percent of the work on any city contract or public works project is awarded to qualified minority contractors." Deutsch said Monday night he was one of about 15 people who formed a line across one of the entrances to the construction site and blocked traffic. He said police told them to disperse after about 10 minutes and that he and four others who refused were arrested and charged with breach of peace and trespassing when they didn't. Deutsch said he was never placed in handcuffs, but an officer informed him he was under arrest and asked him to go sit in a police van, which he did. He said he was released about 9 p.m. on a promise to appear and will be given a court date on Friday at community court. Before the council meeting Monday evening, a group of about a dozen protesters gathered outside City Hall and held signs demanding change and shouting "bad politicians make bad laws." Selders said that group was not affiliated with Moral Monday CT.

"It's a lot of things going wrong with that stadium ... we could talk all day," said Laurie Hamilton, who participated in the protest outside city hall Monday evening. "They should hire the Hartford residents. There's so many skilled people in this city that just need someone to give them an opportunity." . "Minority Hartford construction workers have not gotten a fair shake," Selders said. "City officials have sold out black and brown Hartford."
