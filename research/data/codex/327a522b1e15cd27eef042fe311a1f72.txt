The peaceful event was held to protest the death of George Floyd, who died at the hands of police officers May 25 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.The local event was organized by Diamond Fischer, a 2015 graduate of Taylor High School who now resides in Austin."Black lives matter. That's the main agenda here. We want to make sure black lives continue to matter," she said. "Even in Taylor. We do matter here." Fischer chose Taylor because it is her home and she could count on a peaceful protest from Taylor residents."I would rather protest in my community where I know I'm surround by people I know," she said. "I want to make a change and send a message where I'm from."She said the march was to send a message to stop hate and racism everywhere. More than 50 people participated in the march including city council members and members of the Taylor Police Department. Fischer said it wasn't about the number of participants, it was about the message."One person can walk and make a change," she said.Council member Robert Garcia said he wanted to show his support and help unify the community."It's time for a change. In our country, in ourselves and in our entire world," he said. "I'm here for humanity. We all need to change." Fischer organized the event in about four days and began circulating a flyer on social media. The goal was to show unity and support others who have been victims to social injustice."As long as we continue to matter and we come together as a community around this time to help people around the world and get the message out," she said. "We want to help people who are grieving from [police brutality]."Taylor resident Jules Androh, who said he has witnessed police brutality, joined the protest to make a stand against overlooked injustices."I think it needs to stop," he said. "The only way to change it is for everybody to get up, get out and vote. Help change some laws and the police should be held accountable."He said people shouldn't wait until it hits home before they become active."It'll be too late then. If everyone gets up now to say something, it will make a change," he said. "It took a civil war to change slavery. This [peaceful protest] is in line with what needs to happen to make a change."The original route was from H-E-B on the corner of N. Main and Carlos Parker Blvd. NW to the south side of Taylor. The route changed to a circular five-mile walk. The march went from H-E-B down Main to Mallard, and from Mallard to North Drive. The march then went from North Drive to TH Johnson Drive. At TH Johnson Drive the march turned left onto Bill Pickett Trail and made its way to Carlos Parker Blvd. NW and ended at H-E-B.The time of the event was also changed so that any supporters could still make it to Taylor ISD's graduation ceremony at 10 a.m. Saturday.The event ended with a prayer with all of the participants and police officers who walked and helped control traffic during the march.
