Ten days ago her son was shot by police and now protesters carrying placards were marching for him in front of the Hughes Justice Complex, home of the state Attorney General's office."I wish it never happened, but now that it did happen to my son, I am going to stand up for my son and do everything I must do to get justice for my son," Jackson said at the rally.Jackson said her son is still in a lot of pain, but is making progress daily and is using a walker to get around. "To watch your son endure so much pain and you can't take it away from him, it's terrible.""In due time, God willing, he will be back to normal," said Jackson, who said her son did not deserve to be shot."Justice, in my eyes, is for these cops to be punished for what they did to my son," Jackson said.The marchers demanded that, plus for authorities to identify the State Police trooper and Mercer County sheriff's officer who wounded Hearns seven times on Louise Lane near Calhoun Street Aug. 7.The marchers also called for the state Attorney General's office to step aside and have federal authorities probe the shooting."We don't believe you can be independent," organizer Rev. Lukata Mjumbe said, pointing to the state building.Mjumbe into a megaphone said: "We have 99 questions and justice is one of them. We have 99 questions and transparency is one of them. We have 99 questions and independence is one of them. We have 99 questions and impartiality is one of them."The state Attorney General's office is investigating the incident because it involved a state trooper and county sheriff's officer.The two officers and another trooper confronted Hearns and two other young males walking on Louise Lane shortly after a report of shots fired.Hearns fled, and witnesses told authorities they saw him reach for his waistband before the officers shot him, authorities have said.A .22-caliber handgun loaded with three bullets was found under a car on Calhoun Street, in the vicinity of the shooting 12 hours after the incident, according to the Attorney General's office.Authorities have not said if the gun has been linked to Hearns, or how far it was found from where he collapsed after being shot.Hearn's family lawyer Samuel A. Anyan Jr. has said Hearns was unarmed. The teen has not been charged with any crimes since the incident.At the rally, Anyan said the gun raises questions for him and the community because it was not near Hearns."If you don't find a weapon in the vicinity of where you encounter this child, and where you find him after shooting him, then that raises questions," Anyan said. "Finding a gun 12 hours after such an event also raises questions."Lawyers for both officers have said Hearns was armed and both officers were fully justified in firing at the teen.RELATED: Shooting of teen 'completely justified,' trooper's lawyer saysThe Attorney General's office has been criticized for refusing to release information about the incident, including the identities of each officer involved in the shooting.Mjumbe referred to the officers Monday as: "Officer who and Officer why?""We want to know who shot Radazz, because black lives matter," he shouted.The reverend also directly referred to the Ferguson, Mo. police shooting of Michael Brown last year, saying Brown and Hearns were both wounded seven times."We have to ask, is Trenton Ferguson?" Mjumbe said. "We are not going to stop asking questions."Mjumbe said U.S. Rep. Bonnie Watson Colman (D-12th Dist.) is correct in calling for a federal probe because the state Attorney General investigating is basically, "New Jersey police investigating New Jersey police."Watson Coleman said Monday she plans to meet with the state Attorney General later this week.RELATED: Congresswoman to meet with AG on police shooting of teen The congresswoman reiterated Monday that the amount of information being released to the public by the state Attorney General's office continues to be insufficient and not reassuring to the community.Watson Coleman also said she has not spoken to the U.S. Attorney's office since calling last week for a federal investigation. A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office on Friday said it was closely monitoring the Attorney General's investigation.The protest ended after about 25 minutes due to a heavy downpour, which sent some people scattering, using their placards as umbrellas.Kevin Shea may be reached at kshea@njadvancemedia.com.
