(2:14)FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmailOct 1, 2017ESPN.com staffFacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerPinterestEmailprintPresident Donald Trump criticized NFL players who lodge pregame protests, saying in a speech in Alabama on Sept. 22 that he wished those players would be released. He also encouraged fans who are offended to walk out of stadiums. Several players and coaches reacted strongly to Trump on social media, and players -- joined by coaches and owners, in some instances -- across the league knelt, locked arms, raised their fists and even refused to come out of the locker room during the national anthem in Week 3. Trump has continued calling for action against those who kneel during the national anthem, while owners this week scrambled to retain control.Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started the pregame protest of racial oppression and inequality in the United States last season by sitting during the national anthem before a preseason game, then kneeling during the anthem throughout the season.Previous protests this season: Week 3 | Week 2 | Week 1 | PreseasonHere's what every team did during the national anthem in Week 4 (most recent updates first; more will be added throughout the day):Monday Night FootballKansas City Chiefs: Every Chiefs player stood for the national anthem during Monday's game against the Redskins, except for cornerback Marcus Peters and linebackers Justin Houston and Ukeme Eligwe. Houston kneeled in prayer position on the bench for the first half of the anthem and stood for the remainder, while Peters sat on the bench. Peters has sat on the bench during the anthem in every game this season. He protested by raising his fist during the national anthem for the Chiefs' season opener last year. -- Adam TeicherWashington Redskins: The Redskins all stood for the national anthem , one week after seven kneeled. They did not link arms. The team released a statement after the anthem last week: "Football has always served as the great unifier, bringing people together to celebrate the values of courage, commitment and achievement. We are proud of the players, coaches and fans of the Washington Redskins for all that they have done to improve the lives of others in neighborhoods all across our region. We are also grateful for the sacrifices made by the brave men and women of our armed forces that have provided us the freedom to play football. In that great tradition, the Washington Redskins will work to address divisions and bring unity, civility and respect to our greater community.” -- John KeimSunday's gamesSeattle Seahawks: Several Seahawks players sat on the bench during the national anthem before Sunday night's game against the Colts. Eight of them were defensive linemen: Cliff Avril, Michael Bennett, Frank Clark, Jarran Reed, Sheldon Richardson, Marcus Smith, Nazair Jones and Garrison Smith. Linebacker Michael Wilhoite sat as well. Injured defensive end Dion Jordan stood next to Wilhoite with a supportive hand on Wilhoite's shoulder. Offensive linemen Justin Britt and Oday Aboushi stood on the other end. Aboushi had his hand on Britt's shoulder while Britt had his hand on Avril's shoulder. -- Brady HendersonIndianapolis Colts: A week after having at least eight players take a knee during the national anthem, none of the Colts took a knee during the anthem before Sunday's game in Seattle. Instead, the team collectively stood and locked arms during the anthem. During warm-ups, the Colts wore black T-shirts that said "We will" on the front and "Stand for equality, justice, unity, respect, dialogue, opportunity" on the back. -- Mike WellsESPN Staff WriterThe back of the t-shirts that the Colts are wearing for tonight's game against the SeahawksMike Wells, ESPN Staff Writer agoOakland Raiders: The Raiders stayed true to their word, as last week's near-team-wide demonstration during the anthem was a one-week affair. All Raiders players stood for the anthem in Denver except for Marshawn Lynch, who remained seated and covered by Raiders staff members. Lynch entered the stadium wearing a T-shirt that read: EVERYBODY VS. TRUMP. Lynch has remained seated during the anthem since joining Oakland, but he has never said why he sits. -- Paul GutierrezESPN Staff WriterMarshawn Lynch has not said why he has remained seated during the national anthem since joining the Raiders. The T-shirt he wore entering Sports Authority Field in Sunday, though, spoke volumes: EVERYBODY -VS- TRUMPPaul Gutierrez, ESPN Staff Writer agoDenver Broncos: Every Broncos player stood for the national anthem. But linebacker Brandon Marshall, a former teammate of Colin Kaepernick at Nevada who kneeled before eight games last season, raised his left fist into the air. Last week, 32 Broncos players took a knee during the national anthem before the team's game against the Bills. -- Jeff LegwoldSan Francisco 49ers: Before Sunday's game against the Cardinals, 30 49ers players knelt during the national anthem with a hand over their heart. Those players knelt in a row with the rest of their teammates and coaches behind them. Among those kneeling were linebacker NaVorro Bowman, safety Eric Reid and running back Carlos Hyde. The players in the back row had a hand on the shoulder of each of the players kneeling and the other hand over their hearts. General manager John Lynch and CEO Jed York stood with the team, also with their hands over their hearts. -- Nick WagonerThirty 49ers players kneeled during the national anthem in Week 4.

They did not link arms like they did on Monday Night Football in Week 3. -- Josh WeinfussPhiladelphia Eagles: Safety Malcolm Jenkins continued demonstrating for social justice by raising his first above his head during the national anthem prior to Sunday's game against the Chargers. Safety Rodney Mcleod joined him by raising a fist. Defensive end Chris Long placed an arm around Jenkins as a sign of support. Several defensive backs, including Sidney Jones and Dexter McDougle, locked arms beside them. -- Tim McManusLos Angeles Chargers: All Chargers players stood, some linked arm in arm, during the national anthem before the game.

Linebacker Keenan Robinson also held his fist in the air. -- Jordan RaananTampa Bay Buccaneers: All Bucs players and staff members stood during the national anthem. No players linked arms.

Rams coach Sean McVay said earlier in the week that his team would follow "standard operating procedures” for the anthem. -- Alden GonzalezDallas Cowboys: The Cowboys did what Dez Bryant promised Friday for the national anthem before their game against the Rams: They stood along the sideline without any form of protest. Before their game on Monday Night Football in Week 3, the Cowboys -- including Jerry Jones -- took a knee briefly as a group before the anthem, then they stood arm in arm as the anthem played. -- Todd ArcherBuffalo Bills: A group of six Bills players knelt for the anthem in a line behind the rest of their teammates: wide receiver Kaelin Clay, running back Taiwan Jones, defensive tackle Cedric Thornton, running back Mike Tolbert, defensive lineman Jerel Worthy and cornerback Shareece Wright. All of those players knelt last week except for Worthy, who did not play because of a concussion. Clay wore cleats before the game with the message "#ImWithKap" on them. In addition, cornerback Leonard Johnson stood next to the players who were kneeling. -- Mike RodakKaelin Clay's cleats before the Bills' Week 4 game had a hashtag in support of Colin Kaepernick. AP Photo/David GoldmanAtlanta Falcons: Most of the Falcons linked arms during the national anthem before the game against the Bills, as coach Dan Quinn said they would leading into the game. Defensive tackle Grady Jarrett and Dontari Poe did not take a knee, as they did during last week's game at Detroit. Several players stood with their hand on their heart and did not link arms. -- Vaughn McClureCincinnati Bengals: Most of the Bengals stood with their arms locked during the anthem before the game against the Browns, which is what they did last week. The other players stood with their hand over their heart. A few players last week did not link arms and stood with their hand over their heart instead, and more Bengals players did that this week. No player sat or kneeled, which has been the case since the protests started. -- Katherine TerrellCleveland Browns: All Browns stood for the anthem. About a dozen linked arms, including quarterback DeShone Kizer. About midway through the anthem, eight to 10 players raised their right fist, including running back Isaiah Crowell, linebacker Chris Kirksey and tight end Randall Telfer. -- Pat McManamonThe Browns players who raised their fists during the national anthem in Week 4. AP Photo/Tony DejakDetroit Lions: Steve Longa and Jalen Reeves-Maybin knelt during the anthem before the game against the Vikings. Tahir Whitehead -- who knelt last week -- stood between them with his hands on their shoulders. Nick Bellore and D.J. Hayden also had hands on their shoulders. The rest of the Lions players and coach Jim Caldwell stood in a single line with their arms linked. That included Eric Ebron, who stood alone behind the rest of his teammates last week. Eight Lions players knelt last week. -- Michael RothsteinMinnesota Vikings: A large group of Vikings locked arms during the anthem. Harrison Smith and David Morgan were the bookends on either side of the line of locked arms. Quarterback Case Keenum and Kyle Sloter, running backs Dalvin Cook, Latavius Murray and C.J. Ham, the entire Vikings offensive, and long-snapper Kevin McDermott did not participate in the demonstration. Kick returner Jerick McKinnon stood behind the sideline for a second straight week with a trainer and did not participate in the demonstration. -- Courtney CroninVikings players lock arms during the playing of the national anthem. AP Photo/Bruce KluckhohnCarolina Panthers: Defensive end Julius Peppers, who did not come onto the field for the anthem a week ago, stood for the anthem before Sunday's game against the Patriots with his hands behind his back. Thomas Davis and Jonathan Stewart both stood with their hands together in prayer. There did not appear to be a united protest. -- David NewtonNew England Patriots: The Patriots stood side by side on the sideline during the anthem. Most players had their right hand over their heart and their left arm around the player to the next of them. No players kneeled. -- Mike ReissJacksonville Jaguars: The Jaguars knelt as a team before the anthem was played and then stood for the anthem before the game against the Jets. Some players linked arms during the anthem while others stood with their hand over their heart. Coach Doug Marrone was among those linking arms. -- Michael DiRoccoNew York Jets: For the second straight week, the Jets locked arms during the national anthem. Once again, chairman and CEO Christopher Johnson joined the players on the sideline. No one was kneeling. -- Rich CiminiPittsburgh Steelers: The Steelers all stood for the national anthem before their game in Baltimore. Many players placed their hand over their heart, but the team had full participation in standing. In a sign of solidarity last week, the Steelers stayed in the locker room during the national anthem before their game against the Bears. They were one of three teams to do so -- the Titans and Seahawks were the others. -- Jeremy FowlerBaltimore Ravens: The Ravens knelt before the national anthem began, and then rose for the anthem. There was a clamoring of boos when the players knelt. Before the anthem, an announcement was made in the stadium for everyone to pray as a nation to embrace kindness, justice, unity and equality. -- Jamison HensleyTennessee Titans: Receiver Rishard Matthews remained in the locker room during the anthem before the game against the Texans, running out after the performance ended.

Many had arms interlocked or hands on shoulders. -- Mike TriplettMiami Dolphins: Three Dolphins players -- tight end Julius Thomas, receiver Kenny Stills and safety Michael Thomas -- kneeled during the national anthem in London. Those players and the entire Dolphins sideline stood for the playing of "God Save the Queen," England's national anthem. --James WalkerThursday Night FootballGreen Bay Packers: Players and staff linked arms during the anthem at Lambeau Field on Thursday night before the game against the Bears, as planned. It appeared, however, that only small groups of fans joined in linking arms in the stands, as the Packers players had hoped all fans would. "It was an invitation to join us. The beauty is, it's a free country, so they can choose to do it or not," quarterback Aaron Rodgers said after the game. "The messaging of this unfortunately needs to continue to be redirected, I think. -- Rob DemovskyChicago Bears: The Bears joined the Packers in linking arms during the anthem Thursday. Chicago decided last week prior to their home game against the Steelers that every player would lock arms in a sign of solidarity. -- Jeff Dickerson FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmail
