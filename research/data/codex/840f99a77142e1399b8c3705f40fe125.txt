(2:14)FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmailOct 1, 2017ESPN.com staffFacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerPinterestEmailprintPresident Donald Trump criticized NFL players who lodge pregame protests, saying in a speech in Alabama on Sept. 22 that he wished those players would be released. He also encouraged fans who are offended to walk out of stadiums. Several players and coaches reacted strongly to Trump on social media, and players -- joined by coaches and owners, in some instances -- across the league knelt, locked arms, raised their fists and even refused to come out of the locker room during the national anthem in Week 3. Trump has continued calling for action against those who kneel during the national anthem, while owners this week scrambled to retain control.Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started the pregame protest of racial oppression and inequality in the United States last season by sitting during the national anthem before a preseason game, then kneeling during the anthem throughout the season.Previous protests this season: Week 3 | Week 2 | Week 1 | PreseasonHere's what every team did during the national anthem in Week 4 (most recent updates first; more will be added throughout the day):Monday Night FootballKansas City Chiefs: Every Chiefs player stood for the national anthem during Monday's game against the Redskins, except for cornerback Marcus Peters and linebackers Justin Houston and Ukeme Eligwe. Houston kneeled in prayer position on the bench for the first half of the anthem and stood for the remainder, while Peters sat on the bench. Peters has sat on the bench during the anthem in every game this season. He protested by raising his fist during the national anthem for the Chiefs' season opener last year. -- Adam TeicherWashington Redskins: The Redskins all stood for the national anthem , one week after seven kneeled. They did not link arms. The team released a statement after the anthem last week: "Football has always served as the great unifier, bringing people together to celebrate the values of courage, commitment and achievement. We are proud of the players, coaches and fans of the Washington Redskins for all that they have done to improve the lives of others in neighborhoods all across our region. We are also grateful for the sacrifices made by the brave men and women of our armed forces that have provided us the freedom to play football. In that great tradition, the Washington Redskins will work to address divisions and bring unity, civility and respect to our greater community.‚Äù -- John KeimSunday's gamesSeattle Seahawks: Several Seahawks players sat on the bench during the national anthem before Sunday night's game against the Colts.

Lynch has remained seated during the anthem since joining Oakland, but he has never said why he sits. -- Paul GutierrezESPN Staff WriterMarshawn Lynch has not said why he has remained seated during the national anthem since joining the Raiders.

They were one of three teams to do so -- the Titans and Seahawks were the others. -- Jeremy FowlerBaltimore Ravens: The Ravens knelt before the national anthem began, and then rose for the anthem.

The beauty is, it's a free country, so they can choose to do it or not," quarterback Aaron Rodgers said after the game.
