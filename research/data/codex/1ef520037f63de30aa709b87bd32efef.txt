Police turned out in force, arresting five people, and Westlake Center closed early. The tree was lighted on a rainy Friday evening. Shortly before 6 p.m., Seattle police turned shoppers away from Westlake Center, saying it was closed for the night. Mall security confirmed the shopping center had closed. The mall had been scheduled to stay open until 9 p.m. In a statement, Mayor Ed Murray said that while he supports the protesters' First Amendment rights, "violence against property or police officers will not be tolerated in our city." Police said arrests included people accused of assaulting officers and damaging an officer's bicycle. After the tree lighting, the mayor and Seattle Police Chief Kathleen O'Toole visited with young carolers who were interrupted by protesters, the mayor's office said. Demonstrators were protesting this week's grand jury decision in Missouri not to indict a police officer who fatally shot a black teenager. "America goes where their pocketbook goes, so today we're blocking Black Friday," one protest organizer, Marissa Johnson, told KING-TV. "We want you to be uncomfortable shopping." Protesters at one point staged a "die-in," lying down on a floor inside the Westlake Center mall. They also protested outside, blocking streets and intersections near Westlake Park and marching through city streets. Both officers and demonstrators used pepper spray, police said. Some protesters wore gas masks. The first group of demonstrators began marching through downtown Seattle toward Westlake Center as early as 1 p.m., blocking streets before marching into the mall. Most of the marchers were peaceful but vocal as they marched into the mall, then took the escalator to the top level. A few of the protesters became physical, however, and got into a shoving match with police. One person was arrested at that time. Some stores closed as the protest continued. Another group also marched to nearby Pacific Place, and there were reports that demonstrators chained some doors shut there. A large group of protesters then began marching toward Capitol Hill. By early Friday afternoon, the protests were already causing traffic backups in the downtown area and police warned shoppers to expect delays when driving through the area. Police say both protesters and officers used pepper spray during the demonstration. At least five protesters were arrested all together. The Westlake tree-lighting and Macy's star-lighting ceremonies took place around 5 p.m. Protesters made good on their vow to disrupt the proceedings, at one point causing children gathered to sing carols to break into tears. "We're trying to have maximum disruption, maximum attention and potentially shutting down the city as much as we can," Mohawk Kuzma, with the group Justice for Mike Brown Seattle, said before the ceremony. It was the most visible protest since Monday, when people tried to block Interstate 5 by swarming onto the road, and Tuesday, when about 2,000 protesters marched on the federal courthouse. "I want people to understand that black lives do matter and that we're tired of oppression, police brutality, racism and basically police getting away with stuff," Kuzma said.
