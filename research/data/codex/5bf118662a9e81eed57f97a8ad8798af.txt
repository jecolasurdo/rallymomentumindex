Protests against police-related shootings continue in Chicago. (Terrence Antonio James / Chicago Tribune) A small group of protesters returned to Mayor Rahm Emanuel's house Thursday afternoon, repeating a call for Emanuel to resign in the wake of the latest police-involved shooting. About 50 demonstrators, including one with a sign reading, "New Year, New Mayor," faced a line of police in front of Emanuel's three-story colonial home in the Ravenswood community. Advertisement Less than an hour into the demonstration, some of the protesters ventured around the block and through the alley and gathered behind Emanuel's backyard, where they were met by police officers. The two groups clashed, leading to two protesters, including 16-year-old activist Lamon Reccord, being detained and loaded into a police van. Some activists stalled the police van's departure by lying down in the alleyway, though police eventually cleared a path for the van. Advertisement The demonstration ended shortly afterward.
