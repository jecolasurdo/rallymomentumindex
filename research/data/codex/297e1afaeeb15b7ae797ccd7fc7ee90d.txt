Coronavirus Friday update: 17 more Minnesota deaths and 356 new cases MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — A large crowd gathered outside the Hennepin County Government Center on Saturday to demand charges against two Minneapolis police officers involved in the fatal shooting of a black man, and a smaller group then marched through Minneapolis chanting, "No justice, no peace. Prosecute the police.” Jamar Clark, 24, was shot Nov. 15 during what authorities called a struggle. But some who say they saw the shooting have said Clark wasn't struggling and was handcuffed. He died a day later. The shooting sparked protests, including an 18-day encampment outside a police precinct. Jamar Clark (Courtesy of family) Clark's father, James Clark, told the crowd at Saturday's rally that police are supposed to serve and protect. He said when officers kill people, they should be prosecuted. "We are tired of all this. ... There needs to be justice,” he said. The rally, organized by Twin Cities Coalition 4 Justice 4 Jamar Clark, was held in advance of an anticipated decision on whether Officer Mark Ringgenberg and Officer Dustin Schwarze will be charged. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman has said he hoped to have a decision on whether to file charges by the end of March. Saturday's rally remained peaceful. It included several speakers, song and prayer. Demonstrators held banners and wrote messages in chalk on the stairs. Nekima Levy-Pounds, president of the Minneapolis NAACP, was among the speakers at the rally. She urged protesters to speak out, but also work within the system, saying that more people should run for elected office. "We need to become the powers that be,” she said. On Thursday, Minneapolis Police Chief Janee Harteau issued a videotaped message, warning activists that authorities wouldn't tolerate violence. The video included images of Molotov cocktails being thrown over a fence and a broken window in a squad car. The video upset protesters, who said that the images didn't represent the majority of the peaceful demonstrations. They also feared that it signaled the officers would not be charged. Mayor Betsy Hodges issued a statement saying: "I regret that some of the images ... do not reflect that the large majority of the people who protested at the Fourth Precinct last fall did so peacefully.” Tags: Jamar ClarkWest MetroAs you comment, please be respectful of other commenters and other viewpoints.

That I can't support. That's a lynch mob. I believe this is why they alienate many who may otherwise be sympathetic. WeekendThinker I think you're right. Even if there were video clearly showing the guy tried to take the officer's gun, and was handcuffed only after he was shot, they'd still deny the truth. I suspect there won't be any charges. Then the violence will begin and every law enforcement officer in the five county area will be needed to stop the crazies from destroying businesses and lives. TLR Do you really think this will lead to that kind of a protest? I just don't see it happening. Minnesota is a solid blue state. I can't see the agitators coming here to whip up the masses. Nan Baltimore is solid blue. TLR Let's just say I'd be really surprised if more than 100 people protest. Max McGee BLM is the modern day KKK. They try to bully and threaten to riot to change the legal process. punjab83 Careful now, you might be labeled a racist. The word "racist” no longer holds the meaning it used to hold. The word is thrown towards anyone who holds a different opinion. It used to describe a person who is ignorant, and ethnocentric towards another race, etc... Not anymore, I no longer pause when I hear the word. I no longer judge those who are labeled with the word. I simply laugh. I laugh at how such a powerful word, no longer holds the energy it used to. So careful, you might just be a racist. FlyingFarang Don't be so sure. Those clowns don't hold any loyalty when it comes to creating anarchy. Moonbattery If these idiots were able to rationally think instead of acting out of a mob mentality, they wouldn't have gotten hooked up with this pointless, fact-ignorant "movement” to begin with Toofcap Justice? Like $100,000,000 from Gov. Dayquil (D-Brain damaged manchild) can buy votes? ForrestalMN He's had clinical depression that he treats. Calling him brain-damaged is really jackass. rich11ACR Bravo Sierra ForrestalMN Sure, cancer patients or disabled people deserve to be called deformed in your world? FlyingFarang Please don't equate Dayton's physical and mental issues with those of cancer victims. I Detest Leftists He's had clinical depression that he treats. There's a good explanation for that. He got that way by being a Democrat. :-)) Bobby Cat Why are these "activists” fighting so hard for the right of someone to be a drug addict thug? The whole reason the police were called in the first place was because he was beating up his girlfriend. If the police weren't called, was Jamar's father going to be a man with a spine and get the moron to stop doing that? He also attacked the ambulance driver, and yet he keeps getting held up as the poster child for what is right in the world. They don't want justice. They want revenge for someone who wasn't a decent human being in the first place. It's what they do. FlyingFarang Where is the justice for the woman he beat near death? Why have you prevented her from speaking? Enough of the reports that say he was shot while handcuffed. If people saw that then why haven't they spoken to the police and provided proof? A large crowd? Just how many is a large crowd? Whodunnit I'm guessing she's not speaking by her own choice. She has probably already been sternly reminded that snitches get stitches by the black community barney911 Believe me..he wasn't handcuffed. Moonbattery There is a current MN senate proposal to require schools to expel student swho assault teachers for up to a year. It is being vehemently opposed by parents and students who said it would unfairly affect black kids. This is EXACTLY the "victim” mentality that causes these undisciplined kids to grow up to be Black Lies Matter protesters. Robert G. And this begins "Non Enforcement” cops will just ride around in their cars and do nothing other than maybe write a speeding ticket. And that will only happen on main streets and or the "better” neighborhoods. Robert G. Next time a black guy is beating on his GF with a broken ankle and is assaulting an ambulance crew.. "Move it inside”.. mexiapolis It's the same MO everywhere. The professional Race Baiters will fly anywhere to preach their separatism, vicitmology and hate. The reason Jamar is dead is: 1. He was a victim of a "White capitalistic society”. 2. He "3-jacked” his girlfriend and didn't follow police orders. See Treyvon Martin, Michael Brown, etc and etc. JaneDoe Jamar Clark should not be any kind of posterboy or example for any kind of cause. He was a violent criminal thug, engaged in numerous VIOLENT felonies when he was shot by police. He had a restraining order against the GF. He threw a brick thru her front window, and tried to burn her house down with lighterfluid. He beat the crap out of her, and broke her leg badly enough she needed surgery. He assaulted paramedics and police officers that were trying to help her!! It's too bad he chose the life of violence and crime that he did– he ALONE is responsible for his own death. Everything Black Lives Matter protests for is based on lies. When Black Lives Matter starts protesting innocent young black children and bystanders being shot by gang bangers, then maybe they will gain some respect and credibility for their "cause”. Black Lives Matter needs to STOP supporting dead criminal thugs and pretending like they are some kind of innocent angels. I'm sick and tired of these BLM criminals getting away with impeding the RIGHTS of LAW ABIDING CITIZENS. The rest of us have RIGHTS. My right to be SAFE on the roads, and moving about in society is GREATER THAN their right to riot, destroy property, impede access to public areas, and assault other citizens. ARREST BLM activists when they do these things, Chief Harteau– PLEASE!! Why does BLM constantly get a pass on criminal activity???? Toofcap The DA will not proceed with prosecution but Governor Dayquil will save the day by riding in at high noon (no later, he needs 16 hours of sleep each day to control his abundant neurological complaints) with a garbage truck full of Ben-jo-mins taking right from your wallet at the peak of freshness. Naturally, with BLM appetites whetted, they will be back real soon for another feeding at the gov'mint teet. JJ Justice has already been served. A violent felon who was beating up his girlfriend is dead, after resisting arrest. No more Justice is needed here. Give the officers a medal! Common Good what a sad commentary on the black community......MLK weeps Carbon Bigfoot It's Easter, and BLM is looking to crucify a police officer. Bob One article after another quotes this litany: "But some who say they saw the shooting have said Clark wasn't struggling and was handcuffed.” Who are these anonymous witnesses? Why haven't the news outlets questioned them? Why hasn't BLM and NAACP held a new conference so these witnesses could tell their side of the story in public? I, for one, believe that the police are indeed culpable at times. I was not there with Jamar Clark and I cannot say what happened. Perhaps some rogue cop did just take out a gun and assassinate him. But to keep quoting a rumor like that without backup is Irresponsible Journalism 101. That is yelling FIRE is a crowded theater. Shame on you Pioneer Press! Whodunnit The number of faux witnesses increased exponentially after all the media coverage. Remember all the witnesses in the Michael Brown case that were proven had all lied? Yeahright Apparently nobody has ever heard of the judicial system. It involves this person called a judge. Then there are supposed to be a handful of people referred to as a "jury of your peers.” There's also these other people called lawyers. They all sit in a court of law. As far as I know, and I'm no genius, the police are not judge, jury, or executioner. You want to talk about savages? Savages are the ones that believe that due process shouldn't exist and that police can kill indiscriminately. Moonbattery Remember however... the judge and jury must all be black for it to be a "fair trial” blip When you're involved in a violent scuffle with someone who is (re-)attacking his girlfriend (and attacking EMTs, too), you're not mentally bellowing "I.AM.DA.LAW!!!!” in your best Stallone Judge Dredd voice, honey. You're trying to get the situation– and the testosterone-poisoned a-hole who started it– under control. I read court cases for a living: if I had a nickel for every judge who's written about the dangers of your kind of armchair quarterbacking, I'd be rich. The police aren't "savages,” and you damn well know it. FlyingFarang "Savages are the ones that believe that due process shouldn't exist” So you agree that these protesters are savages being that they are demanding prosecution without due process. Very good. Fred, just Fred These weenies out there waiving anarchist flags and demanding justice from the courts....hilarious! TLR Do you really think they know what those flags mean? Anarchist and communist/socialist? Those are some pretty big words with some pretty difficult concepts. Moonbattery They are useful idiots marching to someone else's drumbeat. BLM was in fact started by radical Black Liberation Theology marxists. Fred, just Fred Good point. Moonbattery Take note that these Black Lies protesters usually have a few Black Liberation Theology flags waving around in their little gatherings. BLM is just a front group for the racist Black Liberation Theology marxist cult that MalcomX and Farakhan brainwashed their followers into. Fred, just Fred Those black and red flags are anarchist. Moonbattery The green, black and red ones are Liberation Theology flags. The same flags flown in Chicago's Trinity Church – where Obama sat for 20 years worshipping Richard Wright. FlyingFarang Of course all those flags are OK to wave in public but don't dare display a Stars & Bars because that is racist and displays hatred. Toofcap True dat. Moonbattery The Black Lives Matter anarchist cult was started by well-known militant feminists Alicia Garza, Patrisse Cullors and Opel Tometi. Google those names to learn who this group REALLY is. This is where all of these front groups and Activists behind BLM ultimately trace back to: (CHANGE [dot] TO a '.') discoverthenetworks[dot]org/groupProfile.asp?grpid=7842 bill berdixman things do need to change....He was convicted of 1st degree aggravated robbery in 2010 and was already out of jail and prison. The system needs to be fixed so people who reject our society can live in their own behind bars Nobama Lock and Load everybody. Defend your homes and businesses from these rioters. SHOOT TO KILL ONLY!!!!!!!!!! SkydogRules A young man was shot and killed in North Minneapolis today, no BLM sheeple were there to protest. Shame on you!! Nobama Nobody cares. AT ALL. I hope the family suffers greatly. Note to welfare office less free money next month. NotThatGuy They only care when they think they can get "Trayvon Martin's Mom” rich. Whodunnit Two more were also shot last night: Minneapolis – DOUBLE SHOOTING – 34th and Fremont N – Sounds like a male walked up to a vehicle and opened fire on it – Vehicle fled and reportedly showed up at the hospital minutes later – A house in the area also had rounds go through the front windows NotThatGuy Article should have started "A 24 year old multiple felon was recently killed for acting stupid by our esteemed Law Enforcement” and left it at that. THX1968 The real problem is that a white guy just got stabbed and robbed by three (THREE!) black kids at University and Dale. A week before that a 62 year old white guy got beat and kicked in the head by a young black male on the green line. Concerning issues of race, these things are always touchy, but I foresee a lot of heartache coming particularly to the black community. The Jamar Clark incident, right or wrong, is hampered by the constant violence against the lawful community (black or white). As inept as BLM is, it is constantly hampered by what actually happens in the news on a day to day basis. BLM isn't really helping the black community, or any community, by ignoring the plight that plagues any community. That plague is ignorance of reality. A young black kid that stole a gun from some white guy tried to rob another white guy with his buddies down by river last summer. Guess what? The white guy also had a gun and shot the young black kid dead. Everyone needs to seriously evaluate whats going on, because white people are seriously crazy, and they are all gonna start shooting any black punk that looks sideways at them – especially on the light rail. Snap out of it! My point is that while black kids are beating the shite out of old white people on a damn train, no one is going to care what happens to the Jamar Clarks of our city. Frank "We are tired of all this. ... There needs to be justice,” he said.” Jamar Clark got his true justice. Jay Eagle If Black Lives Matters really cared about black lives mattering, they would be out there fighting to keep their 15 year old girls from getting pregnant by some illiterate drug dealer who can't keep his pants up or hold a job. They would make sure their kids went to school every day and ate decent food. The would not allow their kids to get high. They would be calling the police when they have information about gangs, drugs, guns, and all of the other things that plague their neighborhoods. They wouldn't let their sons wear gang colors and get prison tattoos. They would teach them not to shout the F-bomb when they are walking through the mall. This Jamal character was a street thug. He didn't deserve to be shot if he was handcuffed, but let's remember why the police were called in the first place. He is no hero. He is the kind of POS I am talking about. Black Lives Matter has turned into just another loud, angry crowd that has lost its focus. Common Good jamar clark has followed the pattern of all the other protests over serious and deadly interaction with police and the black community..........committing a crime, refusal to cooperate, and in some cases attacking the officer and going for his gun..........this entire movement is false and it is time for the black community to look at their own behavior and their dysfunctional urban culture Bill Williams They could care less about justice, all they want is blood! Jamar Clark was far from a saint. Where was his father during youth, no where to be seen. This is America and due process of the law is something we all live by, but yet this lynch mob mentality wants the police found guilty without even listening to any of the evidence. Try to get jobs and be responsible parents and this will all go away. mwwild1998 These ignorant, racist, hateful terrorist only care about terrorizing those who have nothing to do with their ignorant racist issues. These cancers to society need to be arrested for blocking traffic, need to be arrested for making terroristic threats of shutting places down. I guess letting the liberals let these cancers to society continue their ignorant, racist, hateful and worthless protest because EVERYTIME they do people realize what a country led by liberals looks like. And it's not a country the majority wants to live in. FlyingFarang Of course the great mayor had to chime in with her regret that the peaceful actions of the protest were not highlighted in the video. One needs to look no further than Detroit, Baltimore, Chicago and New Orleans to see where we are headed if this country says the course. blog comments powered by Disqus More in News Citing concern for indigenous people, Duluth moving to drop 'chief' from city job titles June 18, 2020 at 6:41 p.m. DULUTH, Minn. -- Some job titles for city staff will soon be changing, as the city of Duluth seeks to remove the word "chief" from its leadership lexicon.
