A citywide curfew remains in effect after 8 p.m. in Fort Worth but is set to expire after Wednesday night. Price said the city would consider extending it at a city council meeting at 3 p.m. on Thursday. As for protesters who violate the curfew, Price suggested the city would be lenient. "Our idea is not to arrest people,” she said. "It's a very soft touch to get them to comply. As long as it's non-violent and they're not hurling things at our officers or at other people, we will continue to work with them.” This article tagged under: george floyd protestsFort Worth 0 Weather ForecastDallas, TX Facebook Twitter Instagram Contact Us Newsletters TV Listings Submit Photos Or Video KXAS Public Inspection File Privacy Policy – New Do Not Sell My Personal Information KXAS EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION TERMS OF SERVICE Ad Choices Advertise With Us Send Feedback Copyright © 2020 NBC Universal Inc.
