"I think it starts at a young age you know it's important, so they can see everybody and be a part of a good movement."Perry pulled her children, both under 3, in a wagon. The crowd was mostly young people, many with children or teens in tow. At the Livingston County Veterans Memorial at the corner of State Street and Grand River Avenue, a group of mostly older folks, many of them veterans or Second Amendment activists, protected the memorial and offered less vocal support for the cause.Some of the veterans brought coolers full of bottled water, which they offered to protesters. Two uniformed Howell police officers stood near the memorial watching. Several others could be seen nearby in cars. Other men, who appeared to be plainclothes officers, wandered through the crowd.The gathering drew curious looks, horn honks and the occasional middle finger or white supremacist hand symbols flashed from people driving by on Grand River.

A Twitter user, with a profile that has since been taken down, tweeted "the first town to burn in michigan should be howell."That prompted concerns among police and city officials, as well as residents and business owners. On Wednesday, the City of Howell issued a statement saying that "through an abundance of caution" some city and county offices would be closed for the day. It also urged residents to avoid the area near the courthouse in case large crowds congregated.Some businesses in downtown Howell, like the Dairy Queen and corner coffee shop, were closed for the day, apologizing to patrons with hand-drawn signs posted out front.

(Photo: Kelly Jordan, Detroit Free Press)"There's been a lot of talk all week," said Kerstin Chalifour, who works at the Chocolate Boutique and Bakery, one business that was open. "The mayor came by and talked to us."Chalifour said she doesn't anticipate trouble and would close for the day if it were to break out. Members of Michigan for 2A Sanctuary Counties-Livingston, a Second Amendment rights group, said they were coming to protect the city from violence. Outside the courthouse, several of them were walking around openly carrying handguns on their hips.Others were veterans who say they didn't want to see any damage to the Livingston County Veterans Memorial, which occupies the corner of Grand River and State Street.Harley Wheeler, 24, of Brighton, organized the afternoon rally and acknowledged that she initially had concerns about violence from Second Amendment activists."At first, I was worried until I fully read into what they were saying and how they were going about it," she said. "I now understand that they are only here to protect our town because there are many agitators and opportunists that want to come here and destroy Howell because of its past. Howell is not its past. The people that live here have grown and learned and changed."Middle fingerThe demonstration was small in the morning, but crowds grew in the afternoon.One man with a combed white beard, and a head of hair to match, confronted the protesters with an icy stare. He walked inches from them, their faces barely separated by his raised middle finger. When one protester shouted for him to stop it, he shouted back, "F--- you."Protesters shouted back and shook signs at him. One of the veterans asked him to leave, saying the young people had a right to be heard. The man refused to give his name and left after about 5 minutes.Haylie Wireman,16, attends Brighton High School and said racism remains an issue in the area.Anna Johnson, of Howell, right, reacts to a man who walks along the line of protesters with a raised middle finger as they hold their signs up in front of the historic courthouse in downtown Howell, Michigan as a large crowd came out June 4, 2020, to protest against police brutality and racism did come out to hold signs and rally. (Photo: Kelly Jordan, Detroit Free Press)"I'm here because I'm affected by it," she said. "I'm mixed. I'm black and white and I feel like I lost before I was even born. People judge me before they even know me."She said she has walked into stores only to see other patrons abruptly leave. She has felt the eyes of shopkeepers on her as she walked the aisles and seen the families of classmates flying Confederate flags. Haylie said she has been called the N-word in school and bullied to the point that she considered leaving Brighton High to finish her academic career.She notes that not all classmates use the N-word but many don't object to others who do."They're the type of people who are saying 'Oh, I'd never say it,' " she said. "But if they hear it, they will never do anything about it. They go silent."Staring down the sidewalk lined with white people chanting Black Lives Matter gave her hope, she said."It shows that this many people care about me, care about my life," she said. "Before this, I had nobody. I had me and my friends I had my family but you never know who hates you walking into a store, walking downtown, and it's sad."Police stopsAndre Buford, 30, of Novi, was another African American to attend the rally, coming, he said, to see people stand up in a place where this cause is less popular.Buford works in IT and was visiting a coworker in Howell about three years ago. It was approaching midnight when he stopped to fill his gas tank and saw police officers."They were across the street, almost like they were watching me," he said.Andre Buford, 30, left and Joshua Sylvester, 24, both of Novi, participate in a 9-minute moment of silence with protesters in front of the historic courthouse in downtown Howell, Michigan as several people came out June 4, 2020, to protest against police brutality and racism did come out to hold signs and rally. (Photo: Kelly Jordan, Detroit Free Press)Buford filled up, pulled out and headed for I-96 to return to Novi. Before he could reach the freeway, the police stopped him, told him he didn't signal when he turned onto a one-way street.They also told him he hit the profile of a suspected drug dealer in the area. When he asked how that person looked, the officers told him "a light-skinned black man."Buford said he didn't make a fuss."I didn't know their intentions," he said. They let him go, after writing him a $150 ticket.Like Haylie, he was encouraged to see such a crowd in Howell. "You've got a voice, so use it," he said. "If you don't have the courage to use it, I don't know what your issue is."Robert Miles' shadowHowell has a long history of racial tension. In the 1960s and '70s, Robert Miles, the former Grand Dragon of the Michigan Ku Klux Klan lived nearby. Howell residents are quick to note that he didn't live in Howell proper, but rather in Cohoctah Township, a farming community about 10 miles north of town.Miles was one of several former Klan members convicted of the 1973 bombing of 10 school buses in Pontiac that were to transport students to integrated schools. He held Klan meetings on his farm, but Howell residents note that he drew fierce opposition in the 1970s when he tried to hold one in front of the historic courthouse, where the Black Lives Matter rally was held."We ran him out of here," said Thomas LaMay, 54, of Howell who lives a block from the courthouse. LaMay is a U.S, Army veteran who served with the U.S. Army's 82nd Airborn in Operation Desert Storm. He spent the day at the veterans memorial beside the courthouse, encouraging protesters to make their voices heard.

(Photo: Kelly Jordan, Detroit Free Press)He distributed bottled water from a cooler to protesters and served as a go-between the protesters and the veterans and Second Amendment activists who guarded the memorial after online threats of violence.LaMay said he supported the protesters' message in the wake of the death of George Floyd."I agree with the George Floyd thing, that was terrible," he said. "That police officer should be held accountable."LaMay said he thought the protests should end now because the officer has been charged, but he understood local people wanted to be heard."I"m hoping these protesters are just like the ones in Flint," he said, a reference to a peaceful demonstration where Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson joined. "I'd join them."LaMay said his family is mixed race and that Howell has changed since the days of Robert Miles. People are welcoming and inclusive.Anna Aardal, 16, of Howell, was carrying a Black Lives Matter placard and said she felt compelled to be there because she was so horrified by what happened to Floyd.She said she has received mixed reactions to her protest.Anna Aardal, 21, of Howell, left and her sister Lily Aardal, 16, march with their signs through downtown Howell towards the historic courthouse in downtown Howell, Michigan as a small group of people protesting against police brutality and racism did come out to hold signs and rally June 4, 2020. (Photo: Kelly Jordan, Detroit Free Press)"It has been mostly positive. I would say there have been some people, of course, telling us to go home," she said. "But nothing too aggressive."Others in town said that they hoped people will see that Howell has changed a lot since the days of Robert Miles.Judy Arnold, 72, has lived in Howell her whole life. She acknowledged that community remains mostly white, but said attitudes have changed. When she worked for Citizens Insurance Company, she served on a diversity committee that worked hard for inclusion. The community is welcoming and not the racist caricature it's often considered to be, she said."It's not that Howell any more," she said.Contact John Wisely: 313-222-6825 or jwisely@freepress.com.
