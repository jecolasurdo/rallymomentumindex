A vigil was held Friday evening at Watkins Park in North Nashville, across the street from where Hambrick, 25, was killed by Metro Nashville Police Officer Andrew Delke during a foot chase. Dozens of family, friends and activists gathered as the sun set to light candles in his honor and share memories of Hambrick. "We will get justice," Hambrick's first cousin Domonique Appleton said. She and Hambrick were four years apart and were very close. She and her family do not want to see Delke "get away" with what he did. Delke was charged with criminal homicide in connection with the shooting, and the case is ongoing. "Delke got to celebrate his 26th birthday," Appleton said. "My cousin celebrated his in Greenwood Cemetery. We want to be the example to the families who didn't get justice for their loved ones." Among the mourners was someone who sympathized with how Hambrick's mother, Vickie Hambrick, felt a year after her only son's death. "I know how she felt," Sheila Clemmons-Lee, whose son was also killed by a police officer in 2017, said."It should have ended in 2017. I can't believe we're doing this again."She and Vickie Hambrick have become close in their shared tragedies."I made it a point to let her know I was here and we are here together," Clemmons-Lee said. Emele Battlegriffin said she joined the vigil Friday afternoon to be in solidarity with the family. "This is my neighborhood," Battlegriffin, 62, said.She grew up approximately three blocks from the site of the shooting. She came out to support the family who became a part of her neighborhood due to this tragedy.The next court date in the criminal homicide case against Delke is August 29. Appleton said she hoped each person at the vigil would be in attendance that day. "They can't intimidate us," she said. "We will get justice."
