Religious leaders are calling this the "Palm Sunday Takeover.” The symbolism is clear: it's the day Christians believe Jesus rode into Jerusalem, as he sought to bring an end to the corruption of the city's leaders. A diverse group of more than 50 protesters marched on the Chicago Police Department's 25th District headquarters, demanding reform after high-profile police killings in the Laquan McDonald and Bettie Jones cases. It was all part of a citywide demonstrations in which protesters went to all 25 police stations. Delivering a bushel of apples to the district command staff, religious leaders called on officers to help root out corruption. A coalition of churches called the Community Renewal Society is calling for the city council to pass an ordinance which would increase oversight and accountability. But at the 16th District, two Chicago aldermen staged a counter-demonstration Alderman Anthony Napolitano, a former Chicago cop, says with increasing violence in some city neighborhoods, the police need more support. Last week, the police board announced three finalists to become the new Chicago Police superintendent. The final decision rests with Mayor Emanuel, and he says he will talk with each candidate. He can either pick one, or reject them all and start a new nationwide search.
