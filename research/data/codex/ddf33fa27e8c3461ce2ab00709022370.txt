Carter promised to continue that legacy."I told him that anybody who stands in the way, anybody that stands in the way of true justice, I will make it my personal duty to expose it," he said.Young "Terrell" #TonyRobinson on funeral visitation slideshow pic.twitter.com/2BDU0tyrnZ— Lindsey Branwall (@lindseybranwall) March 14, 2015 Johnnie Robinson, Robinson's cousin, said after the service that it was beautiful, and said that hearing everyone speak so highly of Terrell was a testament that "he was a good person.""Terrell was a passionate and compassionate young man, and a wonderful friend. He was always there when you needed him for an ear to listen, a deep conversation about life's complexities or just to make you smile," said Robinson's obituary, which was read aloud at the service.The obituary said the 19-year-old was determined for he and his four brothers to become professional athletes, and he would often practice football with them. In the meantime, he planned to study business at Madison College after taking time off since graduating high school six months early, according to the obituary.A quote from Tony Robinson on the memorial card at his funeral. #TonyRobinson pic.twitter.com/O5lUikQHcx— Rachael Lallensack (@rlallensack) March 14, 2015 He also enjoyed longboarding and "listening to music of all kinds," the obituary said.
