Updated: 7:58 AM PST Feb 2, 2017 KCRA Staff More than 100 protesters marched through downtown Sacramento on Wednesday evening in disagreement with the Sacramento County district attorney's decision not to charge the two officers in the shooting death of an armed man. Demonstrators, who were part of Black Lives Matter Sacramento, started at Sacramento City Hall, walked up I and J streets and then back to city hall. "If I'm not putting my body on the line for my fellow citizens right now, then I'm doing something wrong -- so that's why I'm out here,” protester Ryan Calbreath said. Protesters were marching against the Sacramento County District Attorney's Office's decision, announced Friday, not to bring charges against the officers involved in Joseph Mann's shooting in July. "The officers were justified in shooting Mann to defend themselves and each other, to protect the public from imminent harm, and to prevent the escape of a suspected felon who posed a significant threat of death or serious bodily injury to others," the office said in a statement. Mann, 51, who was armed with a knife and was acting erratically, was shot 14 times during a confrontation with police in July 2016 on Del Paso Boulevard. Protesters called for Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert to resign. "Our DA is letting police go over and over again for killing people that don't deserve to die,” Black Lives Matter -- Sacramento Organizer Tanya Faison said. "So, we need to be heard. And a couple minutes of discomfort in your car is nothing compared to what this family is feeling.” "We hope to accomplish that they pay attention, that they give us a voice,” Mann's brother Robert Mann said. "For too long we're never heard, we're never seen.” An internal police investigation is still underway. "If the internal investigation concludes officers were following policy, then it is past time for us to change those policies,” Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg said in a statement. "There must be accountability.” The Sacramento City Council voted unanimously to pay for 40 hours of comprehensive crisis intervention training for the police department during its third meeting of 2017. During the protest, police closed the nearby I-5 onramp to protesters and drivers. They also closely monitored the NB I-5 offramp at J Street. The ramp reopened before 7 p.m. ___ KCRA's Tom Miller contributed to this story. SACRAMENTO, Calif.
