"I know a lot of people that have neglected the Black Lives Matter movement and have even gone so far as to call it a terrorist group.”It was coming to Florida State and becoming more versed on matters that were disproportionality prompting injustices within minority communities that allowed Baerwald the begin a process of becoming an ally for marginalized groups."I thought about creating an event as a white dude from Wisconsin and learned that it was hard for me to speak on behalf of a community that I'm not a part of, so I began to talk to people that were aware of the black experience because these issues were their reality,” Baerwald says. "I learned about being an ally and amplifying voices and encouraging a dialogue across differences. It really was a group effort.”Joseph was another organizer of the peaceful assembly, gathering a group of students to participate by addressing them through an open letter. This letter detailed the issues that he saw that were most pervasive within the black community and plead for help producing action-based change.Joseph, a sophomore majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering, credits San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick's actions as part of the inspiration for this act of unanimity. Kaepernick has been a focal point of media attention for his refusal to stand during the National Anthem during his professional football games, instead taking a knee -- an action sparking both outrage and admiration for what he explains as a stand against "the treatment of blacks in America.”Joseph explains that Kaepernick's actions forced him to ask the question, "what was going on in the world right now?” His search for an answer prompted him to work to combat discrimination and disadvantages felt by minority groups."[Kaepernick] brought awareness to a topic that is really easy to sweep under the rug,” Joseph says. "Him sitting down started a conversation, which was maybe not in the way that he planned because there were people that didn't understand why he was standing and failed to realize that he's doing this to bring attention to issues that affect our community.”Joseph continues by explaining that although this act worked to prompt meaningful discussion about the current status and devaluing of black lives in America, he wants to work to make it known that the reason behind it wasn't just about police brutality."It stems deeper,” Joseph says. "There is a lot of injustice within our entire community -- there is mass incarceration and a justice system that is designed to keep blacks at the bottom. This was an attempt to show that these problems still exist and white privilege is still a thing.”Racial disparity continues as a conventional pattern within the U.S. prison system, which is also the largest prison system in the world and one where, "African-American males are six times more likely to be incarcerated than white males and 2.5 times more likely than Hispanic males,” according to data collected by the Sentencing Project. This data also shows that if this current trend continues to hold true, one of every three black American males born today can expect to go to prison in their lifetime.It is statistics like these as well as the questions of the role that systemic white privilege plays in the social upward mobility of people of color and police relations that have promoted such a call to action on the part of FSU students that were involved in the demonstration during the game.Joseph explains that this wasn't done for the name recognition or the limelight, even noting that he initially shied away from an interview by reporters from ESPN that were covering the display."I'm just another kid that's trying to follow in the footsteps of activists and become part of the next generation of them,” Joseph said. "My dream is to continue to bridge that gap. My dream is that America can be a place that is tolerant to all colors, races, sexual identities and genders. When we say 'liberty and justice for all,' I want it to truly mean all.”When asked about the overall success in terms of creating a dialogue about the issues, Baerwald explains that he is "satisfied with what the group accomplished.”"It's tough to say immediately because something like this produces such incremental change,” Baerwald says. "When we read through chapters of a history book and see all of the change that came about, like during the Civil Rights Movement, we forget to consider that that took years and years of activism.”To those that might not completely understand the issues facing black and brown communities, Baerwald explains it is easy to overlook truth in statements and speak on behalf of identities and realities that some don't understand or have never experienced."I would urge them to seek to understand and then be understood.”CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://fsune.ws/2egzvWGFind JobsShare your feedback to help improve our site experience!
