Clark on May 31, 2020 - 6:25 pm Some 100 people or so participate this afternoon in a 'Black Lives Matter' peaceful protest at Ashley Pond Park in downtown Los Alamos. The protest is among many protests (several erupting in violence) taking place across the nation in response to the recent death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, while in police custody in Minneapolis, Minn.

Foree Tobias said of the protest, 'You feel so much hope and unity'. McCarn pointed out that the protest was organized with the support of the Los Alamos Police Department. He added that while the police department coordinated with them to hold the protest, the department wished to stay out of the way. 'We have an excellent police department,' McCarn said.
