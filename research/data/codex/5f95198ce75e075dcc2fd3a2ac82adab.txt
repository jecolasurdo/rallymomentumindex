Wednesday afternoon more than a thousand people came out in Big Rapids to stand together. "It isn't like them against us,” protester Sparkalena Boose says, "It's us together.” "No matter what your background is, no matter what political party you belong to, no matter what your orientation is, it's going to take all of us,” says protest organizer Byron Brooks. The efforts for political change and understanding stretch well past the big cities. The crowd marching through Ferris State University's campus fighting against systemic oppression and fighting for equality. "To be ignorant of something isn't a bad thing,” says Boose. "To be ignorant means not to know any better. This is a point to be educated in those things in the small communities.” "Being a small community in Northern Michigan, many people may have perceptions,” Brooks says. "While they may, I am truly confident that there is more love than hatred within the city.” Today's rally was a culmination of several that were planned, the others canceled due to threats. Brooks looked to work hand-in-hand with police on the event. "To show the community that all police are not bad,” Brooks says. "There are two ways to be successful at this job,” says Ferris State Department of Public Safety Director Bruce Borkovich. "Number one is to love the community you serve and number two is to build trust with them every day.” In the end that's what it's going to take for peace to prevail, a trust between the police and those they serve. "At the end of the day they're policing this community,” Boose says. "So it's important that they know the communities that they are policing.” FacebookTwitter Related Posts: DNR Prepares to Reopen State Campgrounds Monday Northern Michigan in Focus: Our Lady of the Woods Shrine Reflecting on Idlewild's Rich Black History, Juneteenth 9&10 News Top Stories Coronavirus Crisis: Latest Updates DNR Prepares to Reopen State Campgrounds Monday Northern Michigan in Focus: Our Lady of the Woods Shrine Reflecting on Idlewild's Rich Black History, Juneteenth Northern Michigan Anti-Racism Task Force Hosts Juneteenth Celebration Downtown Traverse City Bank Property to be Converted into Park Walstrom Marine Acquires Traverse Bay Marine Court of Appeals Denies Request to Rehear Challenge to Michigan's Redistricting Commission Retiring Well: Returning to Business in Uncertain Times Sights and Sounds Drone Edition: Our Lady of the Woods Shrine Most Viewed Four People Arrested After Traffic Stop in Mackinac CountyGovernor Whitmer Announces Next Steps for School ReopeningPopular Traverse City Restaurant May Close Due to COVID-19Coronavirus Crisis: Latest Updates20 States See Surge in New COVID-19 CasesWoman Pleads No Contest to Embezzlement in Emmet County About 9&10 NewsConnect Meet the Team Reception Troubleshooting Advertising Sales Creative Services Employment Opportunities Contact Us Public File What's On Newsletter Sign up Submit a Photo Privacy Policy / Terms of use Sign Up / Modify Alerts CommunityActs of Kindness Bikes for Kids Community Calendar Connect Contests & Events Community Sponsorship Request Expert Tips Law Help Line Lost and Found School Closings GT Pulse Travel Club Veterans Resource Station Viewer Photos – MILens Virtual Buck Pole Sign Up / Modify Alerts NewsPresidential Primary Candidates Local Election Results Primary Election Results Latest News Michigan News National News International News Business News News Tips MedWatch Mugshots Drone Video Podcasts Where are they now?
