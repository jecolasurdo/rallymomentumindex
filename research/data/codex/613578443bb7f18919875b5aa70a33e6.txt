The Afrikan/Black Student Alliance described the action as a "reclamation” of the structure, which houses mostly administrative offices — including the office of Chancellor George Blumenthal — in addition to various student support services, the Information Technology Services Support Center and the Title IX offices. Citing their distrust of the media, specifically the Sentinel, and fear of racist retaliation if their identities were revealed, members of the alliance declined to directly explain their actions and aims. The alliance also threatened to press unspecified charges against the Santa Cruz Sentinel for approaching the building to request an interview and for taking photographs of the students. However, the alliance provided administrators a list of demands complete with reasons and justifications for those demands. THEIR DEMANDS Most notably, the alliance demands the university purchase an alliance-run and operated property to serve as a low-income housing cooperative for historically disadvantaged students. The alliance cites the fact that limited and unaffordable housing options have negatively impacted African, black and Caribbean-identified students, forcing many "to take leaves of absences, withdrawals or have not been able to attend UCSC at all.” The demands also call for four-year housing guarantees to all African, black and Caribbean-identified students at the Rosa Parks African American Theme House. U.S. military veterans, regents scholars, international students and Smith Renaissance Society students all have four-year guarantee housing as new freshmen, according to a UCSC housing guarantee document. The Smith Renaissance Society provides financial support to students who were once foster children, wards of the court, runaways, orphans or had absentee or mentally ill parents. The alliance has also asked UCSC officials to remove the beds from the Rosa Parks African Theme House lounge by Fall 2017. The lounge space was recently converted to serve as residential space. Students were living there in Fall of 2016, according to Scott Hernandez-Jason, UCSC director of News and Media Relations. The lounge was converted to housing in an effort to accommodate a growing student body. "Lounge spaces, especially the Rosa Parks African Theme House lounge, have historically served as a safe space for African, black and Caribbean-identified students,” according to the alliance. "Releasing this space to serve its original purpose will help retain African, black and Caribbean-identified students on this campus.” To this end, the alliance also wants UCSC officials to paint the exterior of the Rosa Parks African American Theme House in the Pan-Afrikan colors of red, green and black. CULTURAL COMPETENCY A/BSA has also demanded that UCSC require mandatory, in-person diversity competency training for all incoming UCSC students. "The Black Experience Team, Campus Climate Reports and student feedback alike all suggest that African, black and Caribbean-identified students at UCSC do not feel a sense of belonging here on campus,” according to the alliance. "More culturally competent students on campus can help aid this problem and help students feel more included around their peers.” Finally, the alliance has demanded the university allocate an additional $100,000 to permanently hire a SOAR/Student Media/Cultural Arts and Diversity adviser who has personal and professional experience handling African, black and Caribbean-identified student issues. They also demand the alliance has a final decision on the hire. "The university wants its students who self-identify as black to feel supported. We've reached out to the students today and hope we can some common ground,” said Hernandez-Jason. Roughly 4 percent of UCSC students self-identify as either black, or black and another ethnicity, according to Fall 2016 enrollment numbers. In its reclamation statement, the alliance describes itself, in part, as a place to offer support for "various racialized macro-and-microaggressions.” It is unclear whether the alliance is referring to any specific incidents of racism on the UCSC campus. In its most recent Campus Security and Fire Safety Report, which provides the most recent hate crime statistics, there were no incidents of hate crime based on race occurred on campus from 2013 to 2015; but five incidents based on sexual orientation were reported during the same time period. However, as recently as April 24, dozens of white supremacist fliers appeared on campus. Most of the postings bore the name American Renaissance, a monthly online publication. The "reclamation” of Kerr Hall originally began as a rally at Quarry Plaza at noon Tuesday. The alliance has repeatedly confirmed it will not vacate Kerr Hall until its demands are met.
