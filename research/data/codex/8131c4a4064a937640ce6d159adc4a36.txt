Andrew Dye/Journal Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save A group of 11 protesters demanded justice Thursday for Deshawn Lamont Coley, who died last week in the Forsyth County jail.Coley, 39, died May 2 after he suffered a medical condition, authorities said.Black Lives Matter Winston-Salem staged the rally at the corner of the North Martin Luther King Jr. Drive and New Walkertown Road in the city's eastern section. Their signs read "Truth and Justice for Deshawn Coley,” "Black and Brown Lives Matter,” "End Mass Incarceration” and "Indict the System.”Daniela Etienne, Coley's wife, who didn't attend the rally, has said she believes her husband died from complications of asthma that medical providers at the jail failed to properly treat. The autopsy results are pending. The Winston-Salem Journal made a public-records request for emails about and any video of Coley's death from Forsyth County Sheriff Bill Schatzman and any relevant emails from County Manager Dudley Watts.Lonnie Albright, an assistant county attorney representing the sheriff's office, denied the Journal's request, saying the SBI is looking into Coley's death. Watts said no emails about the case were exchanged between his office and county commissioners.At the rally, Tony Ndege of Winston-Salem said demonstrators want the sheriff's office to release any video showing Coley's death to his family and publicly release more details about his death."Deshawn was loved by a lot of people locally,” Ndege said. "His wife wants to know the truth about what happened.” jhinton@wsjournal.com 336-727-7299 @jhintonWSJ Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save More information Organizers reschedule rally for inmate who died last week in jail Organizers have rescheduled a rally for a inmate who died last week at the Forsyth County Jail.
