They include former President Abraham Lincoln and Davis, the only president of the Confederacy.Members of Kentucky's Black Legislative Caucus, the NAACP, and several other groups are responsible for the "Move the Monument" rally.Democratic State Rep. Reginald Meeks said it was time to "put aside the politics of the past" and remove the statue.Some who attended the rally held signs suggesting a more appropriate place for the statue would be down the street at the Kentucky History Center.In a news release, organizers called the statue "an insult". "It is important never to forget our history, but parts of our history are more appropriately displayed in museums, not on government property", he told The Hill.

Lee - Bevin called the removal of Confederate monuments a "sanitization of history", comparing the practice to historical revisionism practiced by authoritarian rulers.Governor Bevin did not return a request to his press secretary for comment."This statue tribute to a traitor was erected in 1936 to serve as an everlasting symbol of white supremacy", explained rally speaker Dr. Betty Sue Griffin. Republicans Allison Ball, the Kentucky state treasurer, and state Senator Wil Schroeder are among those who have publicly said they support taking down the monument.Neal said the arguments in favor of the Davis statue deserving a place in the rotunda "rest upon a bed of twigs with no firm foundation"."Some of us just respect our ancestors", he said.
