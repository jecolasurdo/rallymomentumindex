He also encouraged fans who are offended to walk out of stadiums. Several players and coaches reacted strongly to Trump on social media, and players -- joined by coaches and owners, in some instances -- across the league knelt, locked arms, raised their fists and even refused to come out of the locker room during the national anthem in Week 3. There were several more protests in Week 4.Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started the pregame protest of racial oppression and inequality in the United States last season by sitting during the national anthem before a preseason game, then kneeling during the anthem throughout the season.Previous protests this season: Week 4 | Week 3 | Week 2 | Week 1 | PreseasonHere are the players who protested in Week 5 (most recent updates first):Kansas City Chiefs: Cornerback Marcus Peters, wide receiver Albert Wilson and rookie linebackers Ukeme Eligwe and Tanoh Kpassagnon sat for the national anthem on Sunday night in Houston. Peters has not stood for the anthem yet this season. -- Adam TeicherLos Angeles Rams: Outside linebacker Robert Quinn raised his right fist in the air and punter Johnny Hekker wrapped his arm around his waist in support before Sunday's game against the Seahawks, as has been the case for most of this season. A handful of Rams players locked arms last Sunday in Dallas, but that did not appear to be the case this week. -- Alden GonzalezOakland Raiders: Running back Marshawn Lynch remained seated during the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Ravens. He was wearing a Raiders beanie and was surrounded by Raiders staff members. Lynch has not said why he has remained seated during the national anthem since joining the Raiders. He wore a T-shirt before last week's game that read "EVERYBODY -VS- TRUMP." -- Paul GutierrezIndianapolis Colts: The Colts before Sunday's game against the 49ers wore their black T-shirts with the words "We Will” on the front and "Stand for equality, justice, unity, respect, dialogue, opportunity” on the back for the second straight week. And just as in Week 4, the players stood with their arms locked during the national anthem. The team announced Friday that it created a fund that will support charities "working to promote equality, improve relationships between law enforcement and the community and provide opportunities for minorities.” Colts owner Jim Irsay contributed the first $100,0000.ESPN Staff WriterThe Colts are wearing their t-shirts that start with "We Will" on the front for the second straight weekMike Wells, ESPN Staff Writer agoVice President Mike Pence tweeted during the game that he "left today's Colts game because [President Donald Trump] and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem." -- Mike WellsI stand with @POTUS Trump, I stand with our soldiers, and I will always stand for our Flag and our National Anthem. pic.twitter.com/B0zP5M41MQ— Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017 Vice President Mike Pence stands during the playing of the national anthem before the 49ers-Colts game. AP Photo/Michael ConroySan Francisco 49ers: For the second week in a row, the 49ers had more than 20 players kneeling during the national anthem with hands over their hearts. Their teammates again stood behind them with one hand on a kneeling teammate's shoulder and the other over their hearts. The Niners first did that last week in Arizona. -- Nick WagonerTennessee Titans: Receiver Rishard Matthews remained in the locker room during the national anthem for the second straight week, coming out on the field after the performance concluded. Matthews said on ESPN's NFL Live last month: "I plan to kneel until the president apologizes for the comments that he made, because I felt like those were very disrespectful comments." All Titans who were on the field for the anthem stood. -- Cameron WolfeMiami Dolphins: The Dolphins as a team stood for the national anthem on the sideline before Sunday's game against the Titans. Receiver Kenny Stills, safety Michael Thomas and tight end Julius Thomas, however, remained in the tunnel or locker room until the anthem was complete. All three players knelt before last Sunday's game against the Saints in London. -- James WalkerPhiladelphia Eagles: Safety Malcolm Jenkins continued demonstrating for social justice by raising his first above his head during the national anthem before Sunday's home game against the Cardinals. Safety Rodney McLeod joined him by raising a fist. Defensive end Chris Long placed an arm around Jenkins as a sign of support, a gesture he has made since white nationalists held demonstrations in his hometown of Charlottesville, Virginia, this summer. -- Tim McManusNew York Giants: Defensive end Olivier Vernon knelt during the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Chargers, as he has done in the previous two weeks. Linebacker Keenan Robinson raised his fist in the air. The rest of the Giants locked arms. Vernon (ankle) was inactive for the contest. -- Jordan Raanan FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmail
