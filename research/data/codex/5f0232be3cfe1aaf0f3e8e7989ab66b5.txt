As Los Angeles police Chief Charlie Beck was speaking about crime statistics, several activists in the audience turned their backs to the chief in a sign of protest that has become commonplace at these meetings. A woman then initiated chants of "Wakiesha Wilson” – the name of an African American woman whom authorities say hanged herself in a jail cell last year — which was followed by chants of "Fire Charlie Beck.” Police Commission President Steve Soboroff warned the woman he believed was initiating the chants to stop the disruption. After Beck had resumed speaking, Soboroff told a man — whose fist was raised silently in the air — to "please put your arm down; it's disrupting the meeting.” Upon hearing this, several members of the audience questioned Soboroff out loud while some raised their fists in solidarity. One woman started yelling "Brown Act” while another noted that "there's no rule against putting your arm up.” Another man asked Soboroff "can you not speak because of the arm in the air?” Fists raised in the air at LA Police Commission meeting earlier today after Soboroff told a man quietly doing so that it was disruptive. pic.twitter.com/Vlt3eU4G7I — Brenda Gazzar (@bgazzar) December 19, 2017 Meanwhile, Soboroff gave warnings to several members who were speaking, saying they would adjourn the meeting due to the disruptions. Some members of the public asked for the city attorney to weigh in. A police official announced via microphone that everyone would have to leave on their own or not be readmitted. Then, the woman who had been chanting "Brown Act” – referring to an open meetings law – while also raising her fist in the air was surrounded by several police officers. After some verbal sparring and some light scuffling with the officers, she was eventually escorted out and arrested.

Shortly after she was escorted out, LAPD Detective Benjamin Jones said the woman was expected to be booked on suspicion of delaying or resisting a police officer in the performance of his or her official duties. She was handed off to a patrol unit, he said. Black Lives Matter-LA activist Michael Williams said he raises his fist – which had the names of African Americans killed by LAPD officers scrawled on it – in the air at every police commission meeting he attends. He does this in solidarity with other black people, he said, and so that the Commission can see the names of those who have been killed at the hands of LAPD officers. Williams said he did not understand why Soboroff would think he had been disrupting the meeting Tuesday since his fist was not prohibiting anyone from speaking or from listening to what was being said. "It's a plain disregard and violation of people's rights and it's a plain disrespect and showing avarice to community members who care about the community and want to see change within the police department,” the Pasadena resident said. Commissioner Cynthia McClain-Hill noted in a brief interview after the incident that "a black power fist” is not disruptive in and of itself. "I don't know but suspect that the chair conflated that activity along with the comments and other verbal disruptions that were taking place – a variety of things taking place – found that to be disruptive and perhaps associated the two in a manner that was not particularly helpful,” she said. McClain-Hill added that the city attorney present had not determined that raising a fist had been disruptive. Any order to take down a fist that was quietly raised would be improper because the individual who raised the fist was properly exercising his First Amendment rights, said attorney Peter Scheer, a board member of the First Amendment Coalition and former executive director of the nonprofit, who did not attend the meeting. "I would liken the silent raising of a fist at a meeting involving the city police department to professional football players who take a knee during the singing of the national anthem,” Scheer said. "Reasonable people can disagree about whether that's something that those individuals should engage in but I don't think there is any question that that is protected by the Constitution.” Ironically, he said, it sounds like the commissioner's order for the protester to put his hand down itself triggered a disruption, which the president of the meeting was not able to control, he said. "So they ended up with a situation that probably did justify closing the public meeting,” he said. The meeting resumed after the recess with commissioners going into closed session shortly afterward.
