Most in attendance were members of the First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church, United Church of Christ, First Baptist Church or the Episcopal Church of the Advent.The procession began on the steps of the Unitarian Universalist Church on North Street with a speech from Rev. Meg Soens, who organized the event.Soens said the protest was not to incite anger, but to promote peace and give a voice to concerned residents. "It is important for people who have been hearing about things and seeing things on TV to have a way to express themselves and not be silent,” said Soens, who held a banner reading 'Black Lives Matter.' "To be able to walk around speaking out in support for justice for everybody really is an important thing.”Medfield resident David Stephenson attended the procession – at times holding the banner with Soens."I lived through this stuff and it just makes me sick,” Stephenson said, recalling a time of school segregation when he was a child. "I just can't stand it, and I've tried my whole adult life to try to overcome that kind of racism. To see that it's still alive and virulent in this country is really upsetting to me.”Walpole resident Daniel Henderson brought his wife, Pamela, and three children to the procession.As a biracial man, Henderson said he was compelled to participate and show his support for peace."Every time I sit down on the Internet or turn on the TV, I hear about more situations of young black men being profiled and it's something that doesn't seem to be going away,” said Henderson. "I felt like I couldn't just sit by on the sidelines. Even if this is a small gathering, I think it's necessary to lend your voice and speak what you believe.”Pastor Philip Baumen led the procession from North Street to the steeple entryway of the United Church of Christ on Main Street – reciting a prayer and calling for justice."No matter how spiritual you are, no matter how you practice your faith, if you're not practicing justice you're not pleasing God,” said Baumen. "Justice is intertwined with love. Justice without love will never do justice to justice.As the procession traveled east on Main Street toward the Episcopal Church on Pleasant Street, passersby stopped their cars to watch.Medfield local Brian Brown held his candle close to shield it from the wind, which continually blew out the flame. Despite a constant need to relight the candle, Brown said he was hopeful for change."This is one small step,” said Brown. "There's a whole lot more that all of us can be doing.”Episcopal Church Rev. Marks Eames said the procession was positive force."While many, in this particular community, cannot directly relate to what has gone on in Ferguson and other places, we have to respond to it or we cannot get that peace ourselves,” said Eames, a San Francisco native who witness racism growing up. "I think these problems are solvable. If people in Medfield recognize how important some of the things that have happened in New York and Missouri are, then we're recognizing a problem, which is the first step to solving it.”The procession traveled to the First Baptist Church on Main Street to hear from Pastor Jonathan Chechile, who gave a final prayer before leading attendees to the Medfield Library Gazebo."As followers of Christ, we cannot sit by idly,” Chechile said. "This is sin and we're going to work against it, stand against it and say publicly we're against it.”Soens closed the procession, encouraging those in attendance to speak out against racism."We take with us a courage and willingness to speak up and share our thoughts,” said Soens.
