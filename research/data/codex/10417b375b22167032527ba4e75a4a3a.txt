The Counted: people killed by police in the United States – interactive Read more A crowd of about 300 people gathered in Windrush Square in Brixton, south London, bringing traffic to a standstill as they marched to the police station and through neighbouring streets, chanting "black lives matter” and "hands up, don't shoot”. It was the second show of British support against the US shootings in successive days. There was a mass protest in central London on Friday when hundreds of people marched on Westminster. The organisers, the Black Lives Matter London movement, described it on Twitter as a "plea, a cry for help”. margaret (@zawedde_) This is for our brothers and sisters in the states. From London. We here youStop police brutality #blacklivematters pic.twitter.com/cMostA1NgT July 8, 2016 The founder of the Black Lives Matter movement in London, Marayam Ali, told the Voice newspaper she hoped the marches would show that the UK was standing in solidarity with "our American brothers and sisters”. The 18-year-old, who is a sixth-form student, said: "By these people coming here to stand and unite, they are showing that they are against police brutality and that's the most important thing. People forget that racism is a worldwide thing. It's still very prevalent. This is ultimately a cry for help.” Another London demonstration is planned for Southwark in the south of the capital on Sunday.

This is just how things are. We're not taking it anymore”. The silent protest later joined a separate rally outside a police station in central Birmingham where demonstrators demanded to know whether the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) will prosecute police over the death in custody of student Kingsley Burrell, 29, who died of cardiac arrest after being arrested by West Midlands police. An inquest in May 2015 concluded that prolonged police restraint contributed to his death. The CPS said there was insufficient evidence to charge anyone involved but the Independent Police Complaints Commission has asked the CPS to review its decision.
