Autopsy reports say Bland later hung herself in the Waller County jail.Harris County sheriff's deputies were in front of the complex where the state trooper lives. Some mounted patrols were on hand and other deputies were on foot.There were about 40 to 50 people that showed up for the protest. They were talking about how they want more information. They want more of an investigation into the DPS trooper's action.Some protestors talked about what they would like to see happen as they move forward."We take on the people's cause. If the shoe was on the other foot, the government or police would offer a reward for information on what happened to one of their own," said David Olshansky with Newstarter. "But since they are not doing it in this case, it's up to the people to do it.""We are bringing the attention and the focus back to the state trooper who unlawfully, brutalized, arrested our dear sister. We demand that he brought to justice. If Sandra Bland can be arrested for committing no crime at all, surely this racist state trooper can be arrested for being an actual criminal," said activist Anthony Collier.The protest was peaceful.
