The impromptu protest along Woodbourne Road on the Bristol Township and Middletown Township border came together after rumors of a potential demonstration on social media. The fear conveyed in some social media posts was not realized during the protest, which featured signs that said "Black Lives Matters,” "I can't breathe,” and "I stand with Floyd,” referencing the black man murdered by a police officer last Monday in Minneapolis. Passerbys along the busy roadway were largely supportive of the group and many beeped or put their fist up in the air. A few passerbys threw the group the middle finger or screamed an obscenity.

"We see it happen all the time,” she said, calling for change. Breanna Smith, a Bristol Township resident, said she came with Mia to "stand up and be part of the change.” For Kasie Taylor, of Bristol Township, attendance at the protest was unexpected.

This cause is something I'm passionate about.” Couple James W. and Gabrielle P., both of Bristol Township, told LevittownNow.com that they came out to support those suffering.

The group also wore face coverings amid the COVID-19 pandemic. More than a dozen Bristol Township and Middletown police officers and emergency responders sat nearby, but said there were no problems reported. "I was very pleased to see this happen and that it was peaceful,” Taylor said.
