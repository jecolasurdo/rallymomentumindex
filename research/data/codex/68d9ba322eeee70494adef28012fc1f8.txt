Photograph: Lauren Hurley/PA Protesters angry at police over the death of Rashan Charles, a young black man who died after being chased into an east London shop by officers, blocked a road and threw debris at the police on Friday evening. Dozens of people gathered outside the convenience store in Dalston, where Charles was pinned to the floor by police officers who had been chasing him in the early hours of Saturday morning. The 20-year-old was taken to Royal London hospital, where he died a short time later. The protesters pushed mattresses, wheelie bins, traffic cones and rubbish into the street, stopping cars from passing. Several vans of riot police sent to control the demonstration came under attack, with the protesters hurling bottles and other missiles at officers. When a lorry drove through the barricade, hitting the wheelie bins lined up in its path, protesters jumped on board, clinging to the window, while one sat on a bin which was pushed along by the vehicle. A man clambered on to the roof but the lorry continued to drive with people throwing bottles at it.

Fireworks were launched towards the police as a helicopter could be heard circling above. Officers on horses and others in riot vans were deployed as the police tried to contain the disorder and break up groups of protesters. Windows were smashed in several Kingsland Road shops, and some restaurants in the area pulled down their metal shutters, trapping customers inside, as the protest became more violent. Videos posted on social media show people confronting a line of police officers armed with batons as they tried to clear debris off the road.

"At approximately 1540, a number of items were placed on the highway of the A10 Kingsland Road, close to Middleton Road,‚Äù a statement said. "A number of items including bottles have been thrown towards officers who continue to monitor the situation.‚Äù The Hackney division of the Met tweeted an image of a damaged police car and said the increasingly violent protest was not what the Charles family wanted. Hackney Police (@MPSHackney) Officers have been subjected to abuse & violence. Whatever the frustrations, this is patently NOT what the family of Rashan Charles wanted. pic.twitter.com/X0WdLHHt0m July 28, 2017 In a protest on Monday, at least 150 people marched on Stoke Newington police station. Some carried placards which read "Black Lives Matter‚Äù and the crowd chanted "No justice, no peace‚Äù. The Independent Police Complaints Commission has launched an investigation into Charles's death. The Met said Charles was seen "trying to swallow an object‚Äù and that an officer "sought to prevent the man from harming himself‚Äù. In an update on Friday, the IPCC said it had collected videos from cameras worn by police officers and CCTV, and had sent one of its commissioners Cindy Butts to Dalston to meet with people concerned about the case. The Charles family have re-issued a statement first released on Monday, which called for calm. The statement said: "We appreciate all support, but any hostile actions or other events, at this stage, that may risk detracting from our current cooperative engagement with the IPCC and Met police is unwelcome.‚Äù Topics London Metropolitan police Police news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content more on this story Police officer who arrested Rashan Charles cleared of misconduct Officer criticised for 'basic failings' in arrest of 20-year-old who died in east London Published: 15 Aug 2018 Police officer who arrested Rashan Charles cleared of misconduct Rashan Charles: why ex-Met officer great-uncle rejects inquest verdict Rod Charles believes deaths involving restraint such as that of his great-nephew will only rise Published: 25 Jul 2018 Rashan Charles: why ex-Met officer great-uncle rejects inquest verdict Rashan Charles's death after police chase was accident, jury finds Inquest described as a farce after actions of officer ruled as a justified use of force Published: 20 Jun 2018 Rashan Charles's death after police chase was accident, jury finds Rashan Charles's family criticise Met for refusing to suspend police officer Officer involved in death of 20-year-old in east London has been put on restricted duties, against advice of police watchdog Published: 20 Sep 2017 Rashan Charles's family criticise Met for refusing to suspend police officer Police watchdog calls for Met officer in custody death inquiry to be suspended Published: 16 Sep 2017 Police watchdog calls for Met officer in custody death inquiry to be suspended Rashan Charles death: Met officer investigated for gross misconduct Published: 13 Sep 2017 Rashan Charles death: Met officer investigated for gross misconduct Rashan Charles's family air their concerns about 'openness and fairness' Published: 4 Aug 2017 Rashan Charles's family air their concerns about 'openness and fairness' Item in Rashan Charles's throat contained paracetamol and caffeine Published: 3 Aug 2017 Item in Rashan Charles's throat contained paracetamol and caffeine More more on this story Most popular UK UK politics Education Media Society Law Scotland Wales Northern Ireland News Opinion Sport Culture Lifestyle About us Contact us Complaints & corrections SecureDrop Work for us Privacy policy Cookie policy Terms & conditions Help All topics All writers Digital newspaper archive Facebook Twitter Advertise with us Guardian Labs Search jobs Discount Codes Support The Guardian Available for everyone, funded by readers Contribute Subscribe Back to top ¬© 2020 Guardian News & Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
