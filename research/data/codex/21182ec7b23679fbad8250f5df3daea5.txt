"Injustice to minorities should not be tolerated,” a pastor told the peaceful group assembled. A system "has been in place that favors some and diminishes others,” said Brian Newcomb of the United Church in Kettering. >>PHOTOS: Group protests in Oakwood The rally follows several nationwide and Dayton-area protests and events in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a Minneapolis, Minnesota, man who died May 25 in police custody. While Floyd's death was captured on video, for many killed by law enforcement, "there was no video. There was no public record,” Newcomb said. The crowd also observed 8 minutes and 46 seconds of silence to mark the amount of time Floyd was pinned by a police officer who knelt on his neck, leading to his death.Police began to stage near the library since before 4 p.m., blocking off side streets and maintaining traffic for the rally from 6 to 8 p.m. EARLIER: Oakwood: Black Lives Matter rally likely to cause traffic issues on Ohio 48 Police cruisers from Huber Heights, Miamisburg and the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office parked along Shafor Boulevard.Organizers were signing up people to register to vote as the crowd started to gather.Some rally participants stood within the grassy boulevard, some holding up signs as cars slowly drove by, some honking horns in an apparent show of support.Oakwood resident Amaha Sellassie told the crowd, "once one's humanity is denied, then all humanity is denied.”He urged the crowd to "support black businesses, people of color businesses ... doors have to be opened.” Signs carried by participants include "justice has no race,” and "enough is enough,” and "Black Lives Matter.” FIRST REPORT: Black Lives Matter rally set for Oakwood Thank you for reading the Dayton Daily News and for supporting local journalism.
