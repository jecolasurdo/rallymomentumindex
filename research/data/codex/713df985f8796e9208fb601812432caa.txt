(Alan Dep/Marin Independent Journal)Show Caption of Expand A profanity-laced tirade about children who had written "Black Lives Matter” in chalk on a sidewalk prompted a protest Wednesday in Marinwood. The incident, which occurred Tuesday afternoon, was captured on video by several people at the scene and shared widely on social media. Resident Monica Jones said the footage sent shock waves through the community, coming amid nationwide demonstrations condemning the death of George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police. "I was just appalled,” said Jones, who helped organize the protest after she saw videos of the incident online. "With so much happening in our world, to see that type of hatred in our own neighborhood, it was horrible.” A video posted on Twitter shows a man crossing Marinwood Avenue toward a group of people, children and adults, as he yells profanities and homophobic slurs. "You know it's illegal to graffiti?” he says, pointing at chalk markings on the sidewalk, in another video. He then raises both middle fingers and shouts repeated profanities. "Why do black lives matter?” the man says in the video. "All lives matter. Why make it black and white?” Jarrett Standard was driving by with a friend when he heard the commotion and pulled over. "He was really volatile,” Standard said. "I said, 'Peace and love, man, just relax.' Then he flipped me off.” About 200 people joined the demonstration Wednesday evening, which organizers said was aimed at both denouncing the incident on Tuesday and taking a stand against racism and hatred. Some demonstrators held signs and chanted, "No more violence. No more hate.” Others drew with chalk on sidewalks and in the street. "This is to show that we are here to stand up for each other,” Jones said. "We won't tolerate any racist or homophobic behavior in our neighborhood.” For Bruce Anderson, who said he knew the man in the videos but declined to identify him, it wasn't a surprise to see footage of what he called bigotry and anger in Marinwood. Anderson, who is African American and a former board member for the Marinwood Community Services District, was among the supporters of a years-long initiative to change the local Dixie School District's name, which, activists said, is linked to slavery and the Confederacy. The school board voted last year to change the name to the Miller Creek School District, but Anderson said the months of bitter debate leading up to that decision highlighted, for him, "the underlying sentiments out here that tended to lean toward racism.” "There was a lot of anger from people who were able to kind of disguise their racism as protecting the Dixie name,” Anderson said. But for others, Tuesday's incident was disturbingly out of character for Marinwood, which Standard called a "quiet, tight knit community.” "This is super rare,” Standard said.
