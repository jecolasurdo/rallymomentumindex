Leng's home.By Vincent Salzo, Patch StaffNov 7, 2019 1:30 pm ET|Updated Nov 7, 2019 1:32 pm ETReplies (4)(Patch graphic)HAMDEN, CT — Protesters calling for the firing of a Hamden police officer in connection to a shooting that occurred in New Haven earlier this year, demonstrated outside of Mayor Curt Balzano Leng's home on Wednesday night. Carrying a poster that read, "Your police disturbed our neighbor, now we are here to disturb yours," protesters called on Leng to recommend the immediate firing of Officer Devin Eaton, according to the New Haven Independent. Eaton, 29, was arrested by Connecticut State Police Monday last month following an investigation into the April 16 shooting that seriously injured Stephanie Washington. The incident began unfolding around 4:20 a.m. when Hamden Police received a 911 call about a newspaper delivery man being robbed at a gas station in Hamden. Eaton was found to have fired 13 shots at a vehicle that was driven by Paul Witherspoon, who wasn't injured in the incident. Washington, who was the passenger, was shot and taken to Yale-New Haven Hospital for treatment of serious but non-life-threatening injuries.See also:Subscribe Hamden Officer 'Recklessly' Created Risk Of Death In Shooting: State's AttorneyInternal Affairs Investigation To Move Forward Against Arrested Hamden CopYale University Police Officer Terrance Pollock also arrived at the scene and was found to have fired three shots during the incident. Pollock sustained a non-life-threatening gunshot "graze" wound to his right calf, which was determined to be the result of "friendly fire," according to state police. He was not charged in the incident. Subscribe Eaton pleaded not guilty earlier this week and is due back in court on Dec. 10. He is also the subject of an ongoing internal affairs investigation being conducted by Hamden Police. Legislative Councilman Justin Farmer was a part of Wednesday night's protest, less than 24 hours after winning re-election to represent Hamden's 5th District. Farmer implored his fellow leaders to speak up and told the Independent that his main goal is to enact structural changes in the police department. He also wants Leng to see the need for a civilian review board. Leng, who decried the shooting in April, told the Independent that he wasn't home at the time of the protest. Leng issued the following statement on Facebook Thursday morning regarding the protest: "I respect every person's right to protest and make their voices heard. I've listened to the protestors and certainly worked to ensure that they have been treated fairly as they should be. This is a most serious matter. "Bringing a protest to a public official's private home, in my humble opinion, isn't the best practice. It inevitably involves someone's family, and even their neighbors, into a public issue, which they aren't involved with and didn't sign up for. There are many more productive ways to have public discourse. That said, I respect their right to have the protest. I don't respect a fellow official using the time to make knowingly untrue statements about me personally and about our community. "The State took six months to thoroughly and professionally complete their investigation that resulted in Officer Eaton being charged. I respect the State's Attorney finding and result. The Hamden Police Department Ethics & Integrity Unit now has taken this State report and are using its content to help complete Hamden's internal investigation. They have up to 30 days to complete this and for the Police Chief to make a recommendations for action to the Police Commission. These are the officials specifically empowered by our Town Charter to take action in this incident and all police related disciplinary matters. "I am confident that this serious situation and process will be completed very soon, in the thorough and professional manner that everyone deserves."
