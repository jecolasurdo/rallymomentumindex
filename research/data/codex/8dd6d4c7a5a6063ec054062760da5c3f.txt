Marchers carried signs down State of Franklin to Founders Park, where they rallied around several speakers. More than 300 marchers of various ethnicities chanted "Black Lives Matter,” as well as messages about peace, justice and unity, as well as accountability among law enforcement personnel in matters involving people of color. Some marchers carried "All Lives Matter” signs, a message some organizers have characterized as watering down the focus on racial oppression. The unified atmosphere was briefly disrupted by a small group of counter-demonstrators carrying Confederate Flags, one of who made several racially insensitive remarks. After a few non-violent verbal confrontations, marchers went on with the rally. Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.
