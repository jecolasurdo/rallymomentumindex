Scott Trubey Eric Stirgus Helena Oliviero Christian Boone, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution APD reports no arrests for second straight day Rallies for justice extended outside downtown Atlanta on Saturday as events were held throughout the metro area, including in Cobb, Forsyth, Fayette and Gwinnett counties, where thousands participated. The rallies — organized to protest recent killings including George Floyd in Minneapolis — extended to a ninth day in Atlanta. An 8 p.m. curfew originally in place in the city was lifted Saturday by Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms. The mayor has not yet made a determination for Sunday.

Atlanta police have arrested 532 people since the protests began. But no arrests were reported Friday, authorities said. 10:59 p.m.: For the second consecutive day, Atlanta police reported that no protesters were arrested. 10:45 p.m.: Protesters appear to be leaving the Capitol, but many are vowing to return tomorrow.

For the few merchants open for business, it was a welcome relief. "It feels like they're finally starting to listen to us," said Khandee Brown, 31, who attended Saturday's protest. "We don't want to fight. We don't want to argue. We just want to make change." 9:18 p.m.: Just a week ago, rage reverberated through downtown. Cars were burned, stores looted. But tonight, after a ninth day of protests, tensions had abated. There were impromptu dance parties on multiple street corners. Ben E. King's "Stand by Me" serenaded diverse demonstrators, and the sense of unity was palpable. Hope, seemingly lost in the chaos of 2020, had come out of hiding, at least for one day. "I feel love all around," said Cherie Rankin, 43, of Atlanta. "Man, it's flowing now."

A Minneapolis police officer had his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds before Floyd died. "I need you to look at this like you lost a father, an uncle, or a brother, because the truth is, you did,” organizer Sergio Tuberquia said.Tuberquia, 22, helped organize today's march in Freedom Park. It drew several hundred more protesters than expected. "The big goal today is to start branching out to other places,” he said after almost a week of protests in Centennial Olympic Park. "The goal is to be very peaceful and keep protesting,” he said. He and the other organizers hope protests will lead to a governing body for the police.

Others yelled "No Justice, No Peace” as they played. The group was organized on Facebook. Terrell Guerra, 20, a Bethune-Cookman University student, was one of the musicians, playing the tuba. "With all the police brutality and negativity, we wanted to do something positive,” said Guerra, a graduate of Miller Grove High School in DeKalb County.

Organizer Ricky Fleming, 25, of Athens , told the crowd: "We're tired of it. These streets are our streets and we're taking them back.” The crowd carried signs in English and Spanish demanding action. Fleming, who is white, said he got involved because he felt he wasn't doing enough to be part of the necessary changes, such as repealing laws he believes are harmful to non-whites. Several vehicles honked their horns in support of the marchers, who chanted "I Can't Breathe” and "Black Lives Matter” as they walked up Peachtree Street. A group gathered in front of the Atlanta Public Safety head quarters prays before during marching through the streets Saturday, June 6, 2020, in Atlanta.

JOHN AMIS FOR THE ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTION Photo: John Amis The crowd stopped in front of the Fulton County Government Center, where several speakers urged them to vote in Tuesday's elections. "This is where the change takes place,” organizer Keith Strickland told the crowd. As organizer Dionisio Tabora, 27, of Stone Mountain spoke, a woman interrupted him to demand mental health reform. The crowd roared its approval. The protesters went to Atlanta City Hall, where they chanted George Floyd's name as law enforcement officers stood behind a barricade in front of the state Capitol. Several speakers spoke of being accosted by police. Several demonstrators yelled and held signs urging police reform. One man who said he served in the U.S. Navy, Jeff Jones, got on one knee. "We're going to fight for the justice that fights for all,” said Jones, wearing a Colin Kaepernick T-shirt.Dionisio Tabora, 27, one of the organizers of Saturday's march through downtown Atlanta, was pleasantly surprised by the turnout. He expected about 75 protesters. Hundreds gathered. "It fills me with joy to see people not worry about the National Guard and stand up for what is right,” he said. One African-American officer in an unmarked vehicle raised his fist in the air to cheers from marchers as Tabora walked by. Tabora's group screened people who said they wanted to participate to make sure they were non-violent demonstrators.

Some drivers honked the entire stretch of North Avondale Road.Elizabeth and Mark Hammontree, both 25, have participated in multiple anti-racism protests in Atlanta, but the couple who live in the Avondale Estates area felt it was also important to show solidarity in their local community. Hammontree, who is about to start law school after teaching high school English for four years, said he was thinking about his students, particularly his black students, while joining protests. "My black students grow up to be in the constant threat of racist violence and racial profiling,” said Hammontree, who is white. "The time has come to act and to demand real change.” 6/6/20 - Atlanta - Protestors lined N. Highland Avenue in Atlanta for a rally and protest organized for kids and families.

Fayetteville An estimated 2,000 people gathered in Fayetteville for family-oriented rally Saturday afternoon.

"I think it's important for a community to show solidarity,” Domaleski said. "I'm the type of person that doesn't mind getting a little out of my comfort zone.” Police Chief Scott Gray was among those who spoke at the rally, which several church groups also attended. The group marched from a theater to City Hall, with many people carrying signs. Cars driving by honked in support of the demonstrators."I felt like it was important to be there,” Domaleski said.
