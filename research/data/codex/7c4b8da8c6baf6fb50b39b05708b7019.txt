(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images) NEW YORK (AP) — A New York Jewish doctor has apologized for posting comments online supporting a white-only nation and armed racial conflict. Dr. Dov Bechhofer, a resident radiologist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx, was removed from duty this week after an anonymous article on the blogging site Medium identified him as an online commenter on a website that promoted white nationalism. The online poster, who wrote under the name "Dov,” called himself an ethnic nationalist and wrote about his opposition to racial intermarriage and support for proposals to expel non-whites from the US.

Bechhofer confirmed that he made the comments and expressed remorse in a statement emailed to The Associated Press on Thursday. An image of Dr. Dov Bechhofer that was posted in an anonymous article on Medium that revealed his identity. "I am ashamed of the hurtful, unjustifiable words that I posted online that showed callous disregard toward certain minority groups and am deeply sorry for these transgressions,” he wrote. "The posts do not reflect how I was raised or how I actually treat others. I will continue to struggle to understand what brought me to write them.” Bechhofer's father is a rabbi who is a leader of the group Orthodox Jews Against Racism and Discrimination, according to The Forward, a news magazine with a mostly Jewish American audience. Bechhofer began commenting on white-supremacist websites in the fall of 2016. The doctor said he became interested in the websites out of a "scared curiosity about what was being said on these forums about Jews.” "But after spending some time in this toxic corner of the Internet, I eventually became numb to the ugliness of that hateful echo chamber and began participating in the dialogue,” he wrote. Montefiore Medical Center placed the doctor off-duty pending the results of a thorough investigation. "It's been very painful for me overall,” Bechhofer said in a brief phone call with the AP. read more: Jewish Times white nationalism anti-Semitism Bronx Montefiore Medical Center Facebook Twitter linkedin email Print 189 shares comments June 19, 2020 Current Top Stories Despite spike in infections, cabinet okays cultural events up to 250 people By TOI staff Events can go ahead as long as venues are at no more than 75% capacity, dancing is prohibited and standard coronavirus precautions are observed Israel records nearly 350 new coronavirus cases in one day, in first since April By TOI staff Neighborhoods in two Bedouin towns locked down as virus case tally tops 20,000 By TOI staff Netanyahu: No further easing of virus restrictions until infections go back down By TOI staff Gantz: Iran's 'blatant' nuclear violations threaten Israel and global stability By TOI staff and AFP Defense minister hails IAEA resolution criticizing Tehran for blocking inspector's access to suspect sites; vows Iran will never get atomic weapons UN nuclear watchdog passes resolution criticizing Iran, in first since 2012 By AFP and TOI staff Iran tests cruise missile, claims it can destroy targets 280 kilometers away By AP Iran says virus cases top 200,000, death toll nears 10,000 By AFP Juneteenth Day Using blood libel tactics, white mob massacred 300 blacks in 1921 Tulsa 'pogrom' By Matt Lebovic In two days of slaughter, a racist offensive including police and air bombers destroyed Tulsa, Oklahoma's all-black Greenwood district.
