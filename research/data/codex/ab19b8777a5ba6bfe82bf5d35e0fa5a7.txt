Elm Ave. The gathering will start at the park, with the group then walking single file to the Monroe County Courthouse, 125 E. Second St. The requested attire is black T-shirts and signs are encouraged. In light of the COVID-19 rules, participants are asked to wear face masks and stay in small groups six feet apart. "Only peaceful protesting allowed,” organizers said. The protest is sparked by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis after Officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on his neck for several minutes.
