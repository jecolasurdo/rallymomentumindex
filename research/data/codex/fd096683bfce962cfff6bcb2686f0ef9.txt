After viral photos and videos of the incident sparked outrage across the country, the department apologized for "the negative perception of this action" and said it will stop using the transportation technique.On Sunday, protesters marched along the same route Neely walked during his arrest. The march began at 4 p.m. at the Eugenia and George Sealy Pavilion. The Texas Rangers investigated the arrest but said no criminal investigation was needed.A handful of streets in Galveston were closed from noon to 8 p.m. During the event, 23rd Street and 24th Street were closed from Broadway Avenue to Church Street. Church Street was also closed between 23rd and 24th streets, according to city officials.Copyright 2019 by KPRC Click2Houston - All rights reserved.About the Authors:Briana Zamora-NipperBriana Zamora-Nipper joined the KPRC 2 digital team as a community associate producer in 2019.
