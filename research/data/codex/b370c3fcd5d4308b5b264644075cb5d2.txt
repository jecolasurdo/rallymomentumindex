They eventually left the mall shortly after 4 p.m. On Nov. 25 the Galleria closed for about half an hour and seven people were arrested during a Black Friday protest. The protest was part of an economic boycott effortannounced in early November by African-American clergy and activists over issues from police treatment of blacks to bank loan practices to infrastructure neglect in the northern part of St. Louis. The mall was also the site of a protest in late September following the acquittal of a white St. Louis police officer in the shooting of a black drug suspect. That protest ended in more than 20 arrests and generated complaints that police were heavy-handed. 0 comments Tags St. Louis Galleria Daily updates on the latest news in the St. Louis business community.
