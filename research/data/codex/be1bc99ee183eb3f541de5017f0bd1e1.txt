The residents also chanted the name of George Floyd, the 46-year-old black man who was killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis on May 25.The sign displayed by co-organizer Yvonne Tang carried a list of murdered black men from Floyd to Emmett Till. "This isn't about politics," said Tang, a Warren resident. "It's about human rights."The protesters received some negative comments from passersby, but the general response was overwhelmingly positive, the organizers said.Many drivers at the four-way intersection of Mountain Boulevard and Mount Bethel Road honked their horns in support, while others raise fists through sunroofs or out windows. Protesters said they received honks of support from passing Warren Township Police vehicles.A heavy downpour around 1 p.m. dwindled the crowd, but around 70 demonstrators remained as of 2 p.m., three hours after the start of the protest.Tang was joined by fellow organizers Ryan Lin, Carter Larsen and Tarana Ranjan, all recent Watchung Hills grads, at the southeast corner of Mountain and Mount Bethel."It's important for this town especially to see this kind of thing in their own backyard," said Lin. "This town is in a predominantly white, predominantly wealthy area, so it's good to start a conversation to make sure everybody has some exposure to our movement. We're trying to amplify African-American voices.”Noting the support from passing motorists, Lin said the cause is a popular one, though he felt many in the area are hesitant to speak up for fear of being controversial.Tang said she felt it was important for residents to witness a peaceful protest, as perceptions of nationwide protests have been skewed to a degree by looting. She said residents were extra motivated to protest after a post supporting the Black Lives Matter movement was removed from a local Facebook group. She said the post was reported as "hate speech.""I know a lot of people disagreed with that, and here we are," she said.Another recent Watchung Hills graduate, Adrian Pinzon of Green Brook, said it was important to see so many protesters in a predominantly white town and from a predominantly white high school. "As one of the only black kids in this town, it was cool to see how many people turned out to support the cause," he said. "At the end of the day, all lives matter, but our black lives matter too.”Watchung Hills students are no strangers to peaceful protest. Students organized a rally against hate speech in November in response to a fellow student wearing blackface to an off-campus party. Students previously demanded gun reform in a 2018 school walkout.The group planned to hold another protest at the same location from noon to 3 p.m. Wednesday, June 10.Warren Police Offer Support, CondolencesIn a letter to the community Wednesday afternoon, Warren Township Police Chief William Keane offered condolences to Floyd's family on behalf of his department. "We do not support the actions that were taken by those former officers of the Minneapolis Police Department or any officer that thinks this is the right way to conduct themselves," he said.He said it is job as chief to ensure Warren officers conduct themselves without bias, and with dignity and respect for the community. He noted officers receive regular training in bias crimes, use of force and and de-escalation intervention."With that being said, we respect everyone's right to peacefully protest and to be heard during this difficult time," he said, adding it is important that protects remain peaceful and non-violent."Now more than ever is the time for constructive conversations and positive ideas to continue to maintain the trust between the police and the citizens we proudly serve every day."The Warren Township Committee also offered support for the demonstration."The young demonstrators presented an important and timely message in a peaceful and thoughtful manner," the governing body said in a press release. "We encourage elected officials to support meaningful and productive conversations on issues of injustice in order to build trust and ensure that our community is one where everyone feels safe, valued, and welcomed."It is time for our leaders on a local, state, and national level to come together to show respect to all members of our communities as well as ensuring that our law enforcement agencies perform their duties in a fair and just manner."Editor's note: This story has been posted in front of our paywall.
