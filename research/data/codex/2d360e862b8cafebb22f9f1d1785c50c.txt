They're calling on city leaders to make changes. The protest sent council members out of the room, calling for a recess."The council chamber does belong to them but they have to respect us just like we have to respect them," said city council woman of the 8th district, Reva Trammel.It wasn't just a protest. It began with members of the groups "Black Action Now" and "Justice RVA" bringing their concerns to the council, many of them students of VCU. They called it a list of demands.Using the national platform of the "Black Lives Matter" movement, the group brought up local issues concerning housing, education, incarceration, and more."We don't face police brutality one day or another injustice another day. They all come together for black people. That's why we're here, to make our voices heard," said demonstrator Vanessa Nunes."I'm not here to push their buttons and I would hope they wouldn't come to push mine," said city council president, Michelle Mosby.This was Mosby's first meeting as president of the council."I'm a black life so I do understand that black lives matter. I got into this fight to help black lives, white lives, just lives. If we would work together we would get a whole lot more done."The group says if their demands aren't met, they plan to disrupt the UCI road race later this year.
