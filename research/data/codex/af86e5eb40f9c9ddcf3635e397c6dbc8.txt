The earlier protests in Ferguson followed the fatal shooting of Michael Brown by a police officer there.Several people who took part in demonstrations after the shooting were at the protest Friday night, a continuation of a series prompted by the acquittal Sept. 15 of St. Louis police Officer Jason Stockley in the fatal shooting of drug suspect Anthony Lamar Smith after a high-speed chase. The protesters first stopped outside the Ferguson Market, where Brown had a run-in with the store owner before he was stopped by the officer who later shot him. The store has been the center of controversy following the fatal shooting of Brown. The protesters later moved to the Ferguson police headquarters on South Florissant Road. Some of them shouted at officers who stood guard outside.Cori Bush, who has been among those leading the protests, referred to Ferguson as "the place that started it all” while she spoke to the group outside police headquarters. "We didn't try to start from this place. We didn't try to start at all. Darren Wilson made us start,” Bush said, referring to the former Ferguson officer who shot Brown. Wilson claimed self-defense and was not charged in the shooting.LaShell Eikerenkoetter, 27, of Jennings was also among the protesters. She said she has joined demonstrations over killings by police since Brown's shooting. "It was definitely time to come back here and pay homage to what happened in these streets,” she said. "That is the reason we are still going today." Eikerenkoetter said that while she feels there have been some changes made since Ferguson, they were "small steps." "We've had some policy changes, we have more police body cameras...but we've seen body camera footage after footage and we are still being murdered. "Because we are still not surviving encounters with police, the situation hasn't really changed, and so we have to be out here."The protest began about 7 p.m. There were no reports of violence or arrests.On Thursday night, a group of protesters marched on Hampton Avenue in south St. Louis. On Tuesday, a group marched onto Highway 40 (Interstate 64) and blocked traffic. That protest led to 143 arrests for trespassing. 0 comments Tags Ferguson Missouri Black Lives Matter Jason Stockley Anthony Lamar Smith Michael Brown Law and order Missouri executions Law and order Crime tracker Law and order May mug shots Shake off your afternoon slump with the oft-shared and offbeat news of the day, hand-brewed by our online news editor, Mandy St. Amand.
