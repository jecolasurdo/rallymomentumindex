Black Lives Matter Movement Gains New Ally_20160923023702 Author: Kelli Cook Published: 9:33 PM CDT September 22, 2016 Updated: 9:40 PM CDT September 22, 2016 While the nation watches what happens in Charlotte, there has been a whole lot going on regarding race relations right here in Memphis today. From a protest at a busy Midtown intersection to a Memphis congressman making a passionate plea on the House floor. If you were driving on East Parkway and Poplar Ave. around rush hour, you probably noticed a protest with folks holding signs that said "Black Lives Matter.” At the height of the protest there were close to 200 people there, angry over how African-Americans are treated in this country. But there was definitely something that stood out. "Because everybody needs to be involved with racial justice.” Protestors ranged from a 61-year-old native Memphian to those who are just school-aged. "Because black people are just randomly being killed and gunned down and they're important too,” said protestor Judah Sandlin. But if you were driving too fast to notice, pretty much every one at this protest was white. And that's not by coincidence. "White people got together and said, 'we have to do something to combat all the prejudice and racism,' and so they started Showing Up For Racial Justice. There are chapters across the country and we started the Memphis chapter about a month ago,” said protestor Allison Glass. The group known as SURJ planned this protest in response to the shooting of Terence Crutcher in Oklahoma. "I mean, you watch a video of someone with their hands up getting gunned down. I mean, if you're a human being, if you have anything inside of you that feels compassion, how does that not worry you?” asked protestor Sarah Bethany. And they weren't the only Memphians inspired by that incident. "It's not a mere coincidence that every shooting by a police person videoed has an African-American victim.” Congressman Steve Cohen of Memphis renewed his effort on the House floor to pass a bill to encourage states to use independent prosecutors whenever police use deadly force. Cohen is also calling for better police training to understand different cultures. He's also asking for bi-partisan support to get the bill passed.
