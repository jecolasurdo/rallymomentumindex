Up to 150 people, many holding Black Lives Matter banners, brought traffic to a standstill outside east London's Stoke Newington Police Station in a vigil for Rashan Charles.

The 20-year-old died later in hospital. The vigil was organised by Stand Up To Racism and campaigners say they are "enormously concerned and angered" over his death.

The Metropolitan Police said Mr Charles was seen "trying to swallow an object" and that an officer "sought to prevent the man from harming himself". The police watchdog, the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC), is investigating.

"I understand his death has had an impact on some members of the local community." He also said he had earlier met with community representatives and wanted to continue to hear about community concerns. The IPCC posted a statement on Twitter about its investigation: For those following #justiceforrash #justiceforrashman - We are making good progress, building a full picture of what happened and why— IPCC (@IPCCNews) July 24, 2017 We know people have concerns, but our independent investigation will be thorough, rigorous & when appropriate its findings will be published— IPCC (@IPCCNews) July 24, 2017 The crowd marched peacefully from the police station, behind a line of uniformed officers, to the shop where the incident happened. Dalston resident Joyce Folks, 67, joined the walk to the shop as it passed by.

"My condolences are with the family. We are out here in numbers because it is the only way we can show that we care. It is a sign of community spirit. This needs to be peaceful."
