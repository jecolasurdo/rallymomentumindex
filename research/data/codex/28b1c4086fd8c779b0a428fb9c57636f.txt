Problem solved.I imagine that some of you reading this are saying, "Why are people protesting for justice during a time when justice is actually being administered?”And yes, it's true, that protesting or demonstrating about this case seemed more relevant when charges had yet to be filed -- when it was an open question whether there would be any charges or trial.But those who showed up outside the courthouse to protest on Thursday just wanted to be heard. Not by the jurors, but by everybody else."We're here to show solidarity with Corey Jones,” said Elijah Manley, 20. "We want to be the voice of support for the family. We're not here to influence the jury.”Fellow rally organizer, Carlos Naranjo, 35, agreed."We're not doing anything but asking for justice,” he said. "What's wrong with that? We're not cussing, yelling, or starting a riot. We're singing, 'We Shall Overcome.'”In cases of great public interest like this, a small rally for the victim is far from the only chance that jurors have of encountering people with strong views when it comes to police-involved shootings.While the trial is going on, there's no moratorium on pickup trucks driving the streets of downtown West Palm Beach with oversized "Blue Lives Matter” flags fluttering.So why should there be moratoriums on rallies for Corey Jones?Jurors are instructed not to read, listen or watch news reports of the trial or to talk about it with anybody else or visit the places mentioned in the testimony.But short of sequestering them -- locking them up in a hotel every night with a deputy posted outside their doors -- the justice system must balance two sometimes competing constitutional guarantees: The right to a fair trial and the right to free speech.And saying you want the killing of Corey Jones to matter is just as valid as saying you want the rights of Officer Raja to matter in the split-second decision he made to shoot and kill Jones.It's a big messy world out there. And when it comes to the criminal justice system, people paying attention to how it works, or doesn't work, should be viewed more as an ideal than a problem.Even if sometimes that calls for jurors lunching alone.fcerabino@pbpost.com@FranklyFlorida Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you.
