With the popular Day For Night music festival pumping and pulsating a few blocks away, the Market Square Park demonstration drew fewer protesters than other actions in recent months - but activists said they have big plans for the new year. "I'm planning to raise complete total utter hell," said BLM leader Ashton Woods, adding that he'd taken off a month to regroup after the end of the brutal election cycle. "We are gearing up for something different with the chapter," he said. "We are looking to be involved in the legislative session." Barely a dozen protesters turnout out for the early evening protest that turned into a march and eventually settled at Smith and Congress, in shouting distance of the much louder music festival. "What do want? Justice. When do we want it? Now," the marchers shouted as they snaked along Main Street. A few bars patrons on patios - including a man with seasonal beard decor and another toting an ax and dressed as Yukon Cornelius from "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" - took exception to the protesters' vociferous chants. The groups traded angry insults and eventually parted ways without any police interference. A few blocks later, an angry man started rapping at the protesters, shouting his support for Trump and demanding that passersby not call him an elf. As the BLM crowd congregated outside the festival, some protesters started hamming it up, hurling their obscene chants in high-pitched funny voices. Although the local activists took to the streets repeatedly in the aftermath of Trump's November victory, in recent weeks they have been less active, possibly due to a string of arrests. During a rowdy Nov. 10 anti-Trump protest, Joseph Thomas Wade - a protest regular who often dresses like Che Guevara - was arrested and cited for jaywalking, according to court documents. Within a week, prosecutor piled on additional charges accusing him of spitting on a public servant and punching a police horse named Sgt. Curly. Michael Kouznetson and Emily Garcia were also arrested at the Nov. 10 march as was Bryan Sweeney, a Black Panther who landed in cuffs again less than a week later. Most famously, BLM leader Sheree Dore was hit with a felony after police accused her of punching a horse during tense stand-off with mounted officers. While some of the high-profile activists didn't turn out for Saturday's protest, police were notably absent as well. "I think this is the first time ever that they didn't show up," Dore observed toward the end of the two-hour march and demonstration. She - and others waving signs Saturday - attributed the change to the Houston Police Department's change in leadership. "It could be the new police chief trying to play it safe with activists," she said.
