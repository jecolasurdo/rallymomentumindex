Cities across North America took part in peaceful gatherings to reflect on the loss of Brown in the wake of Monday's announcement that the grand jury chose not to indict Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren Wilson in his death. "We are here to show our support to black folks and unite our voices against racism," said Ikram Hamoud, one of the event's organizers. "It's important to realize that Mike Brown isn't the only one, he's not the first one or the last one. This really needs to stop because black lives really matter and it's important to all be accountable for what we're doing." Ottawa police cordoned off a section of York St. and Sussex Dr. for supporters to grieve safely. Those in attendance gathered in a circle holding candles, signs and poster with Brown's picture. As the event commenced, one by one, organizers read the names of other individuals who have been victims of racism in Canada and the U.S. This was followed by a four-and-a-half minute of silence. People from all over came downtown to lend support, including Brettney Young, a U.S. citizen. "This is an issue that's very close to my heart," said Young, who identifies as African-American. "To hear last night that Darren Wilson was not being indicted was devastating to me. This isn't something that just affects one person. It's a systemic issue that's affecting people of colour all over the United States." She added, "I was angry, sad and disheartened. But I'm still trying to hold on to a little bit of hope that we can find justice and change in another way.- dani-elle.dube@sunmedia.ca Comments Share your thoughts Ottawa Weather 29°C A few clouds Feels like 35°C Saturday 33°C Sunday 32°C Monday 29°C Tuesday 29°C More Weather Related Posts PLAYING THROUGH: ClubEG booming with social and competitive golf in Ottawa Cracks of Don: Chilling, graphic hazing allegations from Carcillo.
