The protest marks the one-year anniversary of a townhall meeting gone awry; Lacey walked out on a crowd of argumentative citizens last October who were protesting Lacey's inaction around police violence. Organizers said that was the last time they saw Lacey in person. This led to more than 50 people standing in front of Lacey's home where some delivered speeches as the sun rose. Dr. Melina Abdullah, an organizer for Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, said they were honoring the 422 residents of Los Angeles County who have been killed by the police or died in custody since Jackie Lacey took office in 2012. After a year of standing in front of her office asking for a meeting to discuss the prosecution of officers involved in fatal shootings, Black Lives Matter Los Angeles is giving #LosAngeles District Atty Jackie Lacey a wake up call at her Granada Hills home. pic.twitter.com/lhhXEF0R7U — Jasmyne Cannick (@Jasmyne) October 25, 2018 In her six-year tenure as county prosecutor, Lacey—the first African-American to hold the office—has never filed charges against a police officer involved in a shooting. Even when Charlie Beck, then sheriff of the Los Angeles Police Department, called on Lacey to prosecute one of his own officers following a shooting in Venice this March, she declined to file a case. Since the October townhall one year ago, Abdullah and other Black Lives Matter LA protesters have stood in front of Lacey's office nearly every Wednesday, demanding action. But outside of increased police presence, the response from officials has been muted. Abdullah said that she spoke with Lacey on the phone last December and made tentative plans for a townhall meeting for January this year. But when the time came, Lacey was a no-show. "She's been dodging the community for a year and we figured that she can't dodge us if we come to her house before she leaves for work,” Abdullah said. "So that's what we did.” Protesters arrived at her home at 5:30 a.m., Abdullah said. An hour later, seven squad cars were on the scene. Just after 7 a.m., the police formed a riot-line and pushed the crowd back. Officers formed a barrier around Lacey and escorted her vehicle out of the neighborhood as protesters glimpsed the prosecutor who has eluded them for a year now. "It is the duty of the citizenry to engage our elected officials—to engage those who are supposed to represent us,” said Abdullah, who holds a PhD in political science and teaches at Cal State LA. "She is an elected official and I think she doesn't want to be engaged. We're not going to allow that. And she takes offense to it.” Abdullah said that if the point isn't just to talk with Lacey. Without more police prosecutions, she said the group would continue to protest Lacey even if she engaged with the community. Through a media representative, Lacey responded to the Los Angeles Daily News in a written statement. "While I am sensitive to community concerns, the public and my oath of office demand that I make decisions based on the facts and the law, and that I not charge someone with a crime based on political pressure.” Newsroom Guidelines News Tips Contact Us Report an Error Get the latest news delivered daily!
