"It hasn't been obvious that black lives matter."Ray focused his speech on remembering black people who had been killed by police, including Michael Brown, Tamir Rice and Walter Scott, urging the crowd to speak their names aloud with him.As he spoke, he repeated his belief that not all police are bad — but it's up to both police and citizens to work together to address these issues, instead of falling into an "us vs. them mentality."The protest came two weeks after another BLM protest took place in the square — in fact, organizers Tristan Sajona, Jessica White, Kylie Schroeder and Branden Isola said they pushed their event back when they learned of the July 9 march, to give people who couldn't make it a chance to attend.Like the previous march, organizers emphasized an interest in being peaceful — but they still received some pushback, they said, including one person on the event's Facebook page saying he would run them over if they were unjustly blocking a street during their march.To people like that, Sajona said "Open your eyes. Stop picking and choosing what you want to listen to."However, the protest suffered no disruption, and organizers said they were simply thrilled that there were other people to speak and march along with them.More events are planned for the future, they said — Saturday's march was intended to be a barbecue before costs got in the way — and all four agreed that their message still needed to be sent to both police and citizens in Springfield and around the country."I don't think it's too much to ask," White said, "to ask for people to do their jobs."CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://sgfnow.co/29W0O2XFind JobsShare your feedback to help improve our site experience!
