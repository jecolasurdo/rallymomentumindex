To mark the somber anniversary, rallies, demonstrations and memorials were held throughout the day Thursday, not only by individuals wanting to commemorate McDonald's life, but also by activists demanding that those responsible for his death be held accountable. On Oct. 20, 2014, McDonald was shot 16 times by Officer Jason Van Dyke during an incident on the South Side. Initial police reports said the teen was swinging a knife and lunging at Van Dyke before the officer opened fire. But after more than a year of contentious legal battling, a judge ordered the release of a video from a police dashboard camera that told a different story. In the video, McDonald is not seen as aggressively moving toward Van Dyke. Instead, he's seen walking away from Van Dyke when he is shot, and the officer continues to fire even after McDonald is on the ground. Subscribe Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder in the shooting. He has pleaded not guilty. "Two years ago Laquan McDonald lost his life tragically and unnecessarily," Mayor Rahm Emanuel said in a statment released on Thursday's anniversary. "His death was a wake-up call for our city on an issue that has challenged the city for decades, and brought a renewed commitment to a public conversation about policing and community relations. But more than just breaking from the past, we will continue working together across the city to build a brighter future by restoring trust between residents and our officers, and implementing the reforms necessary to prevent this from happening again."Subscribe McDonald's family, who asked for residents to protest peacefully after the dashcam video was made public in November of 2015, also released a statement marking the anniversary, according to the Chicagoist. "Laquan's death at the hands of Jason Van Dyke was a brutal and senseless act of violence. "Time has not dulled the pain of this tragic loss to his mother, his sister and the rest of his extended family. "We thank all of the people who have honored Laquan's memory and continue to advocate for police reform. "We look forward to the day when Jason Van Dyke will be held responsible for Laquan's senseless murder and everyone involved in trying to cover up this criminal act is held accountable. "Only then will justice truly be served." On Thursday night, two events in Chicago took different approaches concerning the anniversary. A combination candlelight vigil, rally and protest was held in the 4100 block of South Pulaski Road, the site of the shooting. Beginning at 7 p.m., the event was scheduled to run until 11 a.m. Friday, 16 hours in order to represent the 16 times the 17-year-old was shot. "It's time to let these police officers and elected officials know that we didn't forget about their misguided leadership and we will #NeverForget!," stated the event's description, which was posted on Facebook.

Michigan Ave., setting up 16 small yellow crime scene markers to symbolize the bullets fired in the shooting, according to the Chicago Tribune. Margo Hunter, McDonald's cousin, Chicago rapper Rhymefest and others spoke during the rally, which also featured a balloon release to honor the people who have so far been killed in Chicago this year.

The bill creates "a procedure for an election to recall the Mayor of Chicago, an alderman of the City of Chicago, and the Cook County State's Attorney," according to the official synopsis of the proposed measure. "Even though we have seen changes, even though we have ousted [Cook County State's Attorney] Anita Alvarez, even though we have weakened Rahm Emanuel, and even though [Independent Police Review Authority] is soon to be abolished, there are still changes in the community that we demand to see. Getting a conviction for Jason Van Dyke is not enough," Calloway said during a Thursday press conference about the bill, according to the Chicago Sun-Times. "We demand more accountability of the elected officials that we believe co-conspired to cover up the death of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald."
