We need to heal,” the Louisville faith leader said just hours after the city endured three straight nights of protests, arrests and looting in connection to the police shooting-death of Breonna Taylor.The unarmed black woman was inside her home when she was fatally shot in March by Louisville Metro Police Department officers.Randolph joined throngs of others, including state leaders and local activists, mid-afternoon for a more than hourlong Black Lives Matter Healing Ceremony outside the KFC Yum Center on West Main Street.As about a dozen uniformed LMPD officers quietly looked on, state Rep. Charles Booker, D-Louisville, addressed the crowd and stressed the importance of understanding and unification."You have every right to be angry. You have every right to be frustrated ... our lives are important. We matter. That's what this is about,” said Booker, also a candidate for U.S. Senate. "Us coming together saying we don't want to have to deal with someone losing their life ... anywhere. In this society because we need to surpass our dreams.”Sunday updates:Louisville rallies again after arrests at Saturday Breonna Taylor protestsVoices of the protests:What Breonna Taylor demonstrators are telling our reportersKat King, 36, a biology teacher from Louisville, was among several attendees handing out items to the group including water, sunscreen and snacks. Others handed out facemasks."We just went to Costco and put it on a credit card,” King said. "Other items were donated.”Standing nearby, Shawn Hennessey, with Squallis Puppeteers in Louisville, dressed up as Anne Braden, a late local civil rights activist."Since Anne can't be with us anymore, we came to show our support because I believe in the cause. I think if she (Breonna Taylor) was still alive she would have been here.”Phillip Nippert, 52, of Louisville, who took advantage of the sunscreen, said the city and country need change before healing can occur."It can't just be political. It needs to be this,” the Louisville resident said as he pointed into the crowd. "Bonding like this is how we start. It's about relationships. It just can't be political. The thought of someone being shot in their own home is terrifying.”At one point during the rally, the crowd loudly chanted: "Fire those cops.”"She might have been here today; she might have saved your life,” Jecorey Arthur, the rally's emcee and a Metro Council District 4 candidate, told the crowd."Healing is important because it indicates something has changed,” Randolph said as the rally winded down. "We need something to change in this country, whether it's law enforcement, whether it's just the way we do criminal justice or whether it's how we regard each individual.”Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Public Notices Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My AccountSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJob Network Cars.com Louisville Homes Classifieds Education Moonlighting Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2020 www.courier-journal.com.
