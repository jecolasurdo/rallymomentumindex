"This is a systemic problem that we have to address as a community through legislation, through changes in police practices," she said.Georgetown Police Chief Wayne Nero walked around the square with the organizer of the protest, Georgetown resident Doria Fowler. Fowler said she had asked for the police support before the protest and had not expected so many people to attend.Nero later said it was important to let people have a voice. He said he was going to work on bringing a diverse group of people together to discuss what needed to be changed.The marchers included residents and visitors of all ages and a variety of races."We're not here to spread hate," said Lamont Hawkins, who said he was on his way to work in Austin when he stopped to join the protest. "We're not here to spread violence. This is about peace. This is about protest. This is patriotic."Marchers chanted "No peace, No justice." One called out "What is his name?" and the rest responded saying "George Floyd."Kelly Seaman, an English teacher at George Wagner Middle School, said it was important for her to bring her three children to the rally."My heart breaks when kids in this country see (police brutality and racism)," she said. Seaman, who was recently recognized as the Georgetown school district's secondary teacher of the year, said incorporating diverse literature and reading stories that represent all backgrounds is crucial to her curriculum.Jovita Kelly, a Georgetown resident, was one of the marchers. "This brings my heart a lot of joy to see Williamson County coming together," she said. She said the county has a reputation for being harsh on crime but that reputation creates fear for minorities.Jonathan Dade, a candidate in the Georgetown mayor's race, was at the march but said he had doubts about whether it would change anything. "I'm concerned that is might be a flash in the pan," he said.Dade said what the county needs is more diversity in law enforcement and in elected officials.Some businesses on the square offered free water and snacks to the protesters as temperatures rose.Pastor Mechelle Smith, 50, said that the generation before her taking a stance during the Civil Rights movement motivated her to come to rally. "My life was different because of them," she said. "Now we have to think about the next generation."Smith said seeing so many families at the rally marching together was uplifting. "We have to keep these conversations going so that the momentum doesn't stop."At one point, the protesters observed nine minutes of silence in honor of Floyd.A white Minneapolis police office was videotaped on May 25 putting his knee on the back of Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes. Floyd, who was black, later died. Officer Derek Chauvin was fired and faces second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges. Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you.
