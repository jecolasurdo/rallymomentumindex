Unlike the massive demonstration we saw on Sunday. The second night of protests was far smaller with about only a dozen attendees. The small group lined up on Midkiff holding signs calling for justice for George Floyd. Some passing cars made their support heard by honking and cheering."Very excited honks,” Drew Garcia said. "A lot of 'Black Lives Matter' a lot of screaming in excitement.”Others quite the opposite. A string trucks circled past the protesters several times loudly revving their engines and speeding past them. At least two screamed obscenities out their window toward the group."People have been saying that we're stupid, that we shouldn't be here,” she said.The protesters we spoke to said they weren't hurt by the aggressive words, but wish those drivers understood why they were out there in the first place. "They need to put themselves in our shoes because it's hard out here for people like us,” Bree Carter said.Keylin Mosley was horrified when he saw this now infamous video of an officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, but not surprised. "It goes on too much and just because that one time got recorded doesn't mean it's still not happening right now, this very minute,” Mosley said.He said plenty of other incidents never make it on camera.Mosley talked about how once he was driving around looking for his lost dog when a neighbor confronted him. "The man hops out of his truck with a loaded revolver, points it at me, tells me to put my hands up and says 'What are you doing in my neighborhood?'”Carter said she's faced racism ever since she was a kid. "I would defend myself and people would call me the n-word and call me a monkey and just always talk about me,” Carter said. "And I would like react in a bad way and would usually end up with cops being there and they would always take the other kid's side.”As the country looks for solutions to these issues, this group here is starting with a question."Why should I have to be scared to go outside of my own house in my own neighborhood? Why should I have to be scared? That's why I'm out here tonight.”Although the demonstration wasn't as large as Sunday's, Drew Garcia said it's all worthwhile."It can be five people or a hundred people,” she said. "The little things help.”Latest NewsNewsFederal complaint outlines allegations against Midland police sergeant involved in April standoffUpdated: 1 hour ago|By Shane BattisNew details have been released on a Midland police sergeant who was arrested in April after he was involved in a standoff following a crash.NewsTexas Rangers say man was tased and pepper-sprayed at Ector County Jail before he was found unresponsiveUpdated: 1 hour agoNew details have been released after a Black man died while in custody at the Ector County Jail.NewsChisos Mountains Lodge at Big Bend National Park to remain closed through SeptemberUpdated: 2 hours agoThe Chisos Mountains Lodge at Big Bend National Park will remain closed through the rest of the summer.NationalArkansas family's dog dies after being shot '7-8 times' with pellet gun Updated: 2 hours agoA family is mourning after someone peppered their beloved pup with pellets, killing it.NationalNavy upholds firing of USS Roosevelt captain in virus outbreak Updated: 2 hours agoIn a stunning reversal, the Navy has upheld the firing of the aircraft carrier captain who urged faster action to protect his crew from a coronavirus outbreak, the Navy's top officer said Friday.Latest NewsNationalAMC Theaters reverses course on masks after backlash Updated: 2 hours agoThe nation's largest movie theater chain changed its position on mask-wearing less than a day after the company became a target on social media for saying it would defer to local governments on the issue.NationalAP-NORC poll: Majority of Americans support police protests Updated: 2 hours agoAhead of the Juneteenth holiday weekend's demonstrations against systemic racism and police brutality, a majority of Americans say they approve of recent protests around the country.
