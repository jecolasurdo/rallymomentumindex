Unlike the massive demonstration we saw on Sunday. The second night of protests was far smaller with about only a dozen attendees. The small group lined up on Midkiff holding signs calling for justice for George Floyd. Some passing cars made their support heard by honking and cheering."Very excited honks,” Drew Garcia said. "A lot of 'Black Lives Matter' a lot of screaming in excitement.”Others quite the opposite. A string trucks circled past the protesters several times loudly revving their engines and speeding past them. At least two screamed obscenities out their window toward the group."People have been saying that we're stupid, that we shouldn't be here,” she said.The protesters we spoke to said they weren't hurt by the aggressive words, but wish those drivers understood why they were out there in the first place. "They need to put themselves in our shoes because it's hard out here for people like us,” Bree Carter said.Keylin Mosley was horrified when he saw this now infamous video of an officer kneeling on the neck of George Floyd, but not surprised. "It goes on too much and just because that one time got recorded doesn't mean it's still not happening right now, this very minute,” Mosley said.He said plenty of other incidents never make it on camera.Mosley talked about how once he was driving around looking for his lost dog when a neighbor confronted him. "The man hops out of his truck with a loaded revolver, points it at me, tells me to put my hands up and says 'What are you doing in my neighborhood?'”Carter said she's faced racism ever since she was a kid. "I would defend myself and people would call me the n-word and call me a monkey and just always talk about me,” Carter said. "And I would like react in a bad way and would usually end up with cops being there and they would always take the other kid's side.”As the country looks for solutions to these issues, this group here is starting with a question."Why should I have to be scared to go outside of my own house in my own neighborhood? Why should I have to be scared? That's why I'm out here tonight.”Although the demonstration wasn't as large as Sunday's, Drew Garcia said it's all worthwhile."It can be five people or a hundred people,” she said. "The little things help.”Latest NewsNewsGrand jury indicts Tye Anders with evading arrestUpdated: 13 minutes agoA Midland County grand jury has indicted Tye Anders on a charge of evading arrest.NationalNCAA: No championships in states with Confederate symbol Updated: 1 hours agoThe NCAA is expanding its policy banning states with prominent Confederate symbols from hosting its championship events.News Mayor Payton questioned for socializing without a maskUpdated: 1 hours ago|By Shane BattisMayor Payton is under fire for not wearing a mask while spenidng time in a large group.NationalAmerican Airlines bans man who refused to wear face mask Updated: 2 hours agoAmerican Airlines has banned a man who was kicked off a plane for refusing to wear a face covering, among the first such incidents since airlines promised this week to step up enforcement of their mask rules.National'Into the Wild' bus airlifted from Stampede Trail in Alaska Updated: 2 hours agoThe famed "Bus 142” on the Stampede Trail has been removed by the state of Alaska, according to the mayor of the Denali Borough.Latest NewsNationalTrump says he will renew effort to end DACA protections Updated: 2 hours agoPresident Donald Trump said Friday that he will renew his administration's effort to end legal protections for young immigrants after the Supreme Court blocked the first try.NewsCrews contain fire at the Midland landfillUpdated: 12 hours ago|By Matthew AlvarezThe City of Midland has confirmed to CBS7 late Thursday night that a fire did break out at the landfill.News West Texas doctor claims to have "silver bullet” for COVID-19Updated: 17 hours ago|By Jakob BrandenburgDr. Richard Bartlett works at various clinics around West Texas, and says he's found a successful treatment for the coronavirus, however it is not approved by the FDASports UIL lifts broadcast ban for 2020 high school football seasonUpdated: 19 hours ago|By Austin BurnettThe University Interscholastic League announced today that they will allow live broadcasts during high school football games this fall.NationalFauci: 'Football may not happen this year' Updated: 21 hours agoCheck your enthusiasm.
