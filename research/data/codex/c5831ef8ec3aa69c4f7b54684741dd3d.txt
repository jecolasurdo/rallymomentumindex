Emotions range from disappointment to anger among the four players and their parents. The group sent a three-page letter to five Lansing Catholic administrators this week and haven't received any responses, parents of three players told the Lansing State Journal. "There is no care about African Americans at that school," said Karim Abdullah, the father of senior player Matthew Abdullah. "If (administrators) really care, they would have addressed it."

(Photo: Nick King / Lansing State Journal)The four players, including Matthew Abdullah, wrote the letter, with the help of their parents, to address the need to fix "damaged relationships" at the school. The players didn't start in Lansing Catholic's Oct. 6 home game against Ionia after they decided to kneel during the anthem.Their letter requests an apology for how the school handled issues last week and also outlines proposals for improving race relations within the school, including speakers, events and the recruitment of diverse staff.The LSJ left phone messages Thursday for all five administrators listed on the letter, but calls weren't returned. RELATED:Couch: Lansing Catholic's response to protest shows why it was needed Lansing Catholic QB expected to miss Friday's game A spokesman for Sean Costello, superintendent for all Catholic schools in the Diocese of Lansing, said he was out of town for a conference. Michael Diebold, the spokesman, referred all questions to the four Lansing Catholic High School administrators listed in the letter.CLOSE Last fall, four Lansing Catholic football players knelt during the national anthem at games. They did it as a form of protest. They sought reforms from the school to fight racial injustice. An email from Doug Moore, Lansing Catholic principal, said he was "unable to respond" because he also was attending a conference. The letter signed by the four players and parents and sent this week to school administrators mentions: A formal apology to the four students and their parents for "the disrespect shown to us and the unprofessional handling" of the discipline the school issued to players who knelt during the anthem.Clarification on "any ongoing discipline or future (possibly escalating) consequences for the four students who took a knee." A "zero tolerance" policy for racism, including a process for students to follow to report discriminatory issues. A school-sponsored event that focuses on diversity. Diversity and sensitivity training for staff, students and the school's administration starting in the 2018-19 school year with quarterly "follow-up" meetings. Monthly speakers at the school who are "multi-cultural experts" and can help provide insight to students and staff. A "random anonymous survey" conducted by a third party that will help determine if "steps put in place are working/having an effect." Creation of a minority scholarship fund, beginning in the 2020-21 school year. Recruitment of a diverse teaching staff "as positions become available." The letter includes a statement from the four Lansing Catholic football players who were disciplined last week that says they are "looking to raise awareness about the social injustice of racism, using the platform we have." Article continues below letter.Letter from players, parents by Eric Lacy on ScribdIt's unclear if players will kneel before Friday's home game against Detroit Country Day. Lansing Catholic has a 6-1 record this season and is state playoff-bound for the ninth straight year. The Cougars end the regular season Oct. 20 with a home game against Mason. "I don't know what the situation is going to be," said Michael Lynn Jr., the father of senior quarterback Michael Lynn III. "...People have to understand that these kids are very informed."Michael Lynn III was the only player of the four disciplined by the school who didn't play in the first quarter of last week's game. He didn't make his debut against Ionia until the 8:13 mark of the second quarter.The other players who kneeled and then didn't start last week's game are Kabbash Richards and Roje Williams. Rovonya Velasquez, Williams' mother, said the letter was written Tuesday and sent to administrators via email that day and by U.S. mail the following day.Negla Richards, Kabbash Richards' mother, was the only parent unable to sign the letter because she had to work at the time it was compiled, Velasquez said. Velasquez said the players and their parents don't want to cause trouble; rather, they want to do what they can to help Lansing Catholic become a better school. After last week's game and kneeling during the anthem, parents challenged the four players to create a proactive plan to improve the school's environment. "The question was: Now that you guys did this, what do you want?" Velasquez said. "That's what drove the letter.”Eric Lacy is a reporter for the Lansing State Journal.
