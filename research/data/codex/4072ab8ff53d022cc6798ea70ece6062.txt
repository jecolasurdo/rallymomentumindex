(Photo by Javier Rojas, Inland Valley Daily Bulletin/SCNG) Show Caption of Expand Close to 250 people crowded Foothill Boulevard and Garey Avenue in Pomona on Saturday, chanting messages including "I can't breathe” and "No justice, no peace, no racist police” in response to the killing of George Floyd. White police officer Derek Chauvin pressed a knee onto Floyd's neck for 9 minutes, as the Minneapolis man cried, "I can't breathe,” and onlookers begged Chauvin to ease up. Chauvin was charged Friday with third-degree murder.

Many people along the route got out of their homes and raised fists in support. Signs at the Pomona demonstration also proclaimed "Silence is Violence” and "All lives won't matter until black lives matter.” Three high school students from Pomona said they organized the protest. People said they were nervous to come because of the violence that developed at other protests over Floyd, said organizer Anahi Garcia. "We're trying to do what we can to make it as safe as possible,” Garcia said. While Chauvin was charged, the charge doesn't reflect the gravity of the offense, Garcia said. Third-degree murder involves causing death "by perpetrating an act eminently dangerous to others and evincing a depraved mind,” without regard for life and without intent to kill. "It was not an accident. His knee was on his neck,” Garcia said. "We want justice.” Pomona Mayor Tim Sandoval was among the protesters. Pomona police said they were monitoring the protest. "We support everyone's right to protest peacefully,” the department wrote on Twitter. California Highway Patrol officers blocked the Garey Avenue onramp to the 10 Freeway, preventing protesters from getting on the freeway. The protest, which began at 2 p.m., was nonviolent as of 5:30 p.m. But at about 8 p.m., about 40-plus protesters walked onto the 71 Freeway via the Mission Boulevard ramp and blocked traffic in the southbound lanes.

Law enforcement was nearby, apparently halting traffic behind a cluster of vehicles. After awhile, the protesters got off of the freeway and, just before 9 p.m., aproached a Target parking lot and then dispersed.
