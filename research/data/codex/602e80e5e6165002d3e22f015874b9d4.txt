Kelly's Corner is where Fullerton Police brutally beat Kelly Thomas on July 5, 2011. Thomas died days later in the hospital. The killing sparked months of weekly protests at the Fullerton Police Station. Demonstrators gather to protest the police killing of George Floyd About 150 people carrying signs gathered and listened to families whose loved ones were killed by police, some still awaiting answers, all awaiting justice. Youth, activists, and community members, many who knew each other from the weekly protests demanding justice for the murder of Kelly Thomas rallied together. The day prior, Fullerton Police Chief Dunn had alerted local restaurants in the area and told residents to stay away from the area to avoid the protest. Police handed out pamphlets to demonstrators as they arrived to alert them that, while the Fullerton PD supports peaceful protest, participants should not block driveways, sidewalks, or traffic, nor should they "disrupt or terrorize” the community. A drone flew overhead to surveil the crowd's actions. Demonstrators gathered at the memorial to Kelly Thomas About 5pm the group took to the street, marching on Commonwealth, impeding westbound traffic. As they neared the police station, police cars blockaded the street east of the marchers.

The driver accelerated into a man who had his belly against the hood. The man jumped back to avoid being injured. Another man opened the passenger door but was pulled back by others as the car lunged forward repeatedly. A woman then stood in front of the car until she was pulled away by bystanders while the driver continued to lunge his car into the crowd until they parted.

We followed instructions and did not go out to watch or join the protest. Not being there we cannot judge what went right, what went wrong or what was achieved. We believe in justice, the right to protest and authority response to maintain order. Thank you to all. Reply Jon says: June 1, 2020 at 1:04 am The bowels of the police station, really thought you iwere unbiased journalist/reporter, then again you are no different than the culprits your job is to report the facts, since when does a police station have bowels? Oh yeah freedom of speech right. This is why nobody believes the media anymore. Liars are no different than thieves Reply FED UP says: June 2, 2020 at 6:07 pm Agree 100% – Did you notice night before last the curfew mass-text said "Credentialed media only” can be out past curfew? AKA Liars only allowed. The OC register, NY times, on down to this rag – all totally biased, America-hating, disgusting left liars. The colleges on up to the Presidents are liars and Traitors too. Pay attention to the subtext of every article – all race baiting. What will they do when they realize how utterly outnumbered they actually are... Reply Webster's Dictionary says: June 1, 2020 at 12:49 pm Bowels is a perfectly apt descriptor. booking and holding cells are located below ground tucked far away from the main entrance and a definition of bowes is a small part deep inside something large. Interestingly enough, a third definition describes the space between someone's ears whose primary impetus for posting a comment is to talk shit. Reply None Of Your Business says: June 3, 2020 at 6:52 pm Yeah, well. Conservatwits typically have a very limited vocabulary, poor language skills, and very little comprehension of common literary terms and phrases. Reply vernpnelson says: June 4, 2020 at 10:38 am Yeah, last time I used the word "prostrate”, as a description of some politicians' relationship to big businesses – and then people started calling me homophobic. I figured out later that not only was that because the politician was gay (Jordan Brandman) but because they thought I was saying "prostate.” http://www.orangejuiceblog.com/2019/08/despicable-jordan-brandman-on-releasing-the-stadium-appraisal/ Joe Mama says: June 1, 2020 at 5:16 pm These idiots should move out of mommy and daddy's house. Maybe they should move in with the chicoms and see how great socialism really is. They have no real world experience. Only what they've read on social media. Freaking pathetic. If they only would visit some of these foreign countries that they idolize, they might come away with a different perspective. Reply James Baldwin says: June 2, 2020 at 8:11 am God these people are so stupid Reply FED UP says: June 2, 2020 at 6:13 pm Now they're sporting signs "Silence is Violence” – so, in other words, if I disagree with you and don't say anything, I'm literally committing an act of violence... while they burn, break windows, steal, destroy people's livelihoods.. Thanks to them we will NEED Marshall law, unbelievable entitlement, selfishness and stupidity. Disgusting. Reply FED UP says: June 2, 2020 at 6:15 pm OH and did I mention, shooting a cop in the back of the head in Vegas, throwing bricks at random into crowds which can KILL people, lighting buildings on fire with kids in them? Dirtbags, we have ZERO sympathy for you, so you can take your sympathy for a man you don't REALLY give a toss about, and the money you were PAID to protest and hope you enjoy it sitting and ROTTING in a jail cell, preferably for life !!! WELL DESERVED. None Of Your Business says: June 3, 2020 at 6:56 pm Empirical evidence demonstrates that the less intelligent you are, the more Conservative / Religious / Superstitious you are... so, are you referring to whom as being stupid? Reply hildaashworth says: June 4, 2020 at 7:23 am Would it be asking too much of you to post your empirical evidence sites? Bill Schenk says: June 2, 2020 at 7:06 pm As a former business owner in Fullerton for over 40 years, I understand people needing to express themselves. Living in a small town in Colorado now I can appreciate the observers POV and sensitivity in bringing me this story Reply juanita juantia says: June 2, 2020 at 8:04 pm Law abiding lives matter. Ciminal lives DO NOT matter. Reply hildaashworth says: June 3, 2020 at 7:19 am I agree with Jon's comment regarding Jane Rand's use of the word bowels to describe Fullerton Police Station's holding cells. Using the metaphor bowels to describe a holding cell is silly melodrama when put into this article's context and reflects the author's lack of insight into these protests. Reply Mike says: June 5, 2020 at 9:19 pm Remember to turn Face ID off on iOS devices, use a password that you type in manually. The supreme court ruled the police can not force you to unlock your phone with a password. Unless they have a warrent Facial Recognition they can.On Android have it set to password and power button to instant lock. Have the siri shortcut "Police”. Always have a internet drive like Google drive or Dropbox or One Drive constantly uploading photos and videos. Incase they get pass your phone lock. Have Trusted Contacts installed so someone can do a remote wipe. Find my iPhone has a remote wipe too I think. Or your login to iCloud has it. Consider Cyberus for Android it's cheap per year.. Very powerful on rooted phones, Tasker if you are into programming. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply This site uses Akismet to reduce spam. Learn how your comment data is processed.
