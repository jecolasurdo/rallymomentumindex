Antonella Crescimbeni Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save The protests that gripped the University of Missouri have spread beyond the borders of its campus and reached as far as Penn State.A crowd of students, all dressed in black, gathered on the steps of Old Main Thursday afternoon to demonstrate in support of the Concerned Student 1950 movement.Members of organizations such as the Black Caucus, BLUEprint and the Black Male Empowerment Group were also present at the demonstration.Individual students spoke before the crowd, at one point opening the floor to anyone willing to take it. Buy Now Students and faculty gather on Old Main in support of black students at the University of Missouri on Thursday, Nov. 12, 2015. Antonella Crescimbeni Penn State's demonstration comes on the heels of a movement that has affected the University of Missouri for the past several weeks. Dubbed "Concerned Student 1950,” in reference to the year the university admitted its first black student, the movement seeks to address the climate of racial inequity that students feel has persisted, according to a CNN report.The movement took flight largely due to the university's poor response to several instances of racial discrimination in which students were said to have acted out against other students, according to CNN. The movement was the subject of wide attention last weekend when the Missouri Tigers refused to practice in support of it.It hit a fever pitch at the beginning of the week when it lead to the resignation of Missouri President Tim Wolfe effective immediately. Chancellor R. Bowin Loftin will resign in December, according to The Associated Press."We have lots of friend at that school, and it's really difficult for us to go through that...almost having to deal with two schools, essentially," Thomas Leonard, who participated in Thursday's event, said.

Antonella Crescimbeni A member of BLUEprint and Black Caucus, Leonard (freshman-architecture) said, "We wanted to show our support for Mizzou by coming out here, dressing in black."The movement was held not only to show solidarity with the University of Missouri, but also partly to challenge the racial iniquities at Penn State.Ervin Merone, another participant of the demonstration, said while the climate at Penn State is not as dire as that of Missouri's, there are still "hints” of racism."I feel as though it's in the hidden cracks, and that it could come out at any time," Merone (freshman-information sciences and technology) said.

Antonella Crescimbeni Because of their appearance, Penn State Student Democrats Communication Director Luis Rolfo said via email some students throughout the population may feel "vulnerable.”"Everyone, including our legislatures, should realize this,” Rolfo (senior-political science) said.Jerrie Johnson, who spoke during the demonstration, is no stranger to demonstrations, having also participated in the "die-in” on Old Main's steps last spring following the events in Ferguson, Missouri, she said.

They put a tarp out, we laid on it, and it was like, hailing out here,” Johnson (senior-theatre) said. "And then President Barron came out.
