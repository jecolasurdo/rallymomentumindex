The event, which will highlight the murder of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, and many other innocent black lives at the hands of police officers, will be held in Alpine Park. Organizers stated that it will demonstrate solidarity with the nationwide protests of police brutality. The community of Salida is asking residents to come out to share solidarity while abiding by social distancing practices. Ark Valley Voice spoke with Salida Councilman Justin Critelli who said "we are in a place that offers us the privilege to unplug and detach from the cold harsh realities of the world around us if we so choose. So, when we sit in solidarity it means that we are saying that we will not look away and hide behind our privilege but face the injustices cast upon our fellow countrymen and women.” Critelli went on "It is the acknowledgment that to choose to do nothing speaks in resounding approval of a status quo that would continue to oppress people of color. This modern era casts a bright light on these atrocities to make it impossible for an individual with a shred of empathy to deny this dark truth. We are choosing to hold a space from our tiny corner of the country tomorrow to stand with all other protesters.” Organizers are asking those who choose, to "unplug and lend your voice”. As rapper and activist Killer Mike said during his press conference on May 29 "now is the time to plot, plan, strategize, organize and mobilize.” The Ark Valley Voice is a proud member of the Colorado Press Association.
