"White people don't like racism either," Davis said. "It makes them feel bad. It makes them look bad. It's hard to explain to their kids. It affects white people just like it affects black people." Protesters renewed calls for the city to remove its Confederate monuments. A task force commissioned by then-Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake recommended removing two monuments and adding more information to two, but Rawlings-Blake left the decisions to her successor, Mayor Catherine E. Pugh. A spokesman for Pugh said the mayor has reviewed the report of the task force and spoken with mayors around the country who are deciding how to handle monuments in their cities. "She wants to do what serves the best interests of the citizens of Baltimore," the spokesman, Anthony McCarthy, said in a statement. "A decision will be made at an appropriate time."

Scott, a frequent critic of the mayor, said he would introduce a resolution to remove the monuments at a council meeting this week. "Following the acts of domestic terrorism carried out by white supremacist terrorist groups in Charlottesville, Virginia, this weekend, cities must act decisively by removing these monuments," the resolution reads. "Baltimore has had more than enough time to think on the issue. It's time to act." City Councilman Eric Costello sent an open letter to acting city solicitor David Ralph on Sunday requesting his legal opinion on how to "remove, relocate or reinterpret" the city's four Confederate monuments. Doreion Colter, neighborhood chaplain of Coldstream-Homestead-Montebello in Northeast Baltimore, said he was marching for human rights of the person killed and those injured in Charlottesville. "I'm supporting people's right to life," said Colter, 72. "No one should have their life taken way because they don't believe the same thing as someone else."
