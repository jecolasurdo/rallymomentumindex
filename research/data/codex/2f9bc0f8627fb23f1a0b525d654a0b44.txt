The day of action will include a general strike and a silent march to honor lives lost and send a powerful message that Washingtonians no longer tolerate the racism that is built into so many of our institutions. For those who can't march in Seattle, we encourage local groups to organize a march in their communities. We know that not everyone can attend a march for various reasons. Our chapter has made it very clear that we don't want to put people at risk in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. So for those who can't participate in a physical gathering, we urge you to participate in the general strike and in actions that we post online throughout the day. It's important to emphasize that the decision to plan this in-person protest was not made lightly. We understand that people will claim that this protest will increase the risk of harm to members of our community by planning such an action at this time. However, we feel that we are not taking a new risk. Rather, we have already been put at risk. Anti-Blackness is a greater threat to our survival. Racism is its own pandemic. It's killing us, and we are fighting to survive and thrive. There's never been been a time in American history where Black people have not lived and died under the unrelenting boot of racism and systematic oppression. If we truly want to create something that we've never had before, then we need to be willing to do things that we've never done before. A statewide day of action will send a powerful message that Black lives matter in Washington state. Details for the General Strike On Friday, June 12, we urge everyone to spend their time and energy on direct action for lasting structural change. Don't go to work, and don't work from home. We are collecting a list of gatherings in support of the strike across Washington, use it to find an event near you. We encourage you to read our list of demands and take action. If you can't march, take this time as an opportunity to familiarize yourself with your local elected officials. This includes your mayor, city council, county executive, county council, county prosecutor, and state representatives. It helps if you collaborate with friends and neighbors, and reach out to people you know who are more familiar with the local issues. It's up to you to make sure your local officials feel the pressure to improve police accountability and dismantle the structural racism that has been built into all of our institutions.
