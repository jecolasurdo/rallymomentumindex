LOUIS, MO (KTVI)- Tense moments flared in the Central West End when a minivan driver hit a group of protesters and at one point flashed a gun. This came as protests took place around St. Louis after the New York grand jury decision was announced in the case of Eric Garner. Fortunately, no serious injuries have been reported. David Carson with our partner the St. Louis Post-Dispatch snapped pictures of the episode including one showing the driver with a handgun. The paper is reporting this all happened around 8p.m. Wednesday night as protesters were preparing to stage a 'die-in' in Maryland Plaza. Police say the driver is telling them that as the demonstrators were in the street on Euclid and he attempted to go around them. But instead, he struck some of them. It's unclear at this point if the minivan driver drove toward the crowd to try and get through them or if protesters jumped onto his car. Police took the driver into custody while they conducted their investigation. Ems crews responded for two demonstrators who complained of minor injuries but no one was transported to the hospital. Meanwhile a little earlier, Bommarito Automotive SkyFox caught about 100 protesters in front of the Eagleton Federal Building downtown. Some of the demonstrators blocked the driveway coming out of the building's underground garage. That delayed some employees from leaving. A handful of protesters were arrested before that demonstration was done. The co-chair of the Ferguson Commission says the New York grand jury decision just adds more emotion in the wake of the Michael Brown case.
