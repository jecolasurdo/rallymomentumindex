WFAA/ABCPolice brutality protesters in downtown Dallas, Texas. DALLAS, Texas — About 700 protesters took to the streets of downtown Dallas on Saturday afternoon in response to the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis at the hands of police. The protests that had been largely peaceful took a turn come Saturday evening as protesters damaged several Dallas police squad cars and officers deployed "gas" and flash bangs in response to disperse them. Dallas police said they made at least 74 arrests on Saturday night. Those arrested were charged with inciting a riot. Protesters also badly beat a man Saturday night after he confronted them carrying a machete to "allegedly protect his neighborhood,” according to police Sgt. Warren Mitchell. Brief videos of the confrontation posted on social media appear to show protesters throwing things at a man carrying a long object. He then raises it and chases one of them as someone is heard screaming. Moments later, a group of people can be seen punching and kicking the man, before clearing away to leave him immobile and bleeding in the street. Mitchell said the man is at a hospital in stable condition and the incident is under investigation.

May God bless your soul and may God protect your family. I do not agree with all the rioting that is going on. This does not solve anything. America, please demonstrate peacefully. We need our community leaders to stand up and unite our country. Let's end racism. Log in to Reply fero2amadmikegeedubb says: May 30, 2020 at 11:17 pm One PIG can destroy a country.

Log in to Reply madmike272 says: June 1, 2020 at 2:02 pm U.S. Attorney General William Barr said in a Sunday statement that the regional Joint Terrorism Task Forces of the FBI have been directed to locate and apprehend Antifa leaders. His statement was issued after President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would be declaring Antifa a domestic terrorist organization for its alleged involvement in the terrorizing of major cities after the death of George Floyd.
