Log In PLAY VIDEO LOG IN Family of man in altercation with Raleigh police holds protest By Spectrum News Staff Raleigh PUBLISHED 6:24 AM ET Sep. 05, 2018 PUBLISHED September 5, 2018 @6:24 AM SHARE RALEIGH, N.C. -- The family of a man who got into a physical confrontation with Raleigh police last month protested Tuesday evening. Family of Frederick Hall held a protest. Protest was held outside of City Hall. Hall is expected back in court next week. Frederick Hall's family and the group "Justice Served NC" held the demonstration. The protest happened outside of city hall, while Raleigh officials held their regularly scheduled city council meeting. The 44 year old is charged with assault, stemming from an altercation with Raleigh police on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard last month. The situation was caught on video by a bystander and quickly went viral. RELATED: Frederick Hall's family responds to police footage Wake Co.

It showed Hall rushing toward officers before they eventually overpowered him with a Taser and baton strikes. Hall told Spectrum News his side of the story Tuesday at the protest. "They're not seeing that I'm just sitting there holding a conversation with the first officer, and then the second officer comes up and grabs me for no reason," said Hall. "I wasn't feeling good. You know I felt very sick and dehydrated probably to the point that I was stressing from the heat. I was just sitting there talking to the cop and another cop comes up and grabs me and then another cop comes up and grabs me and then that cop tries to grab me. And so I'm trying to defend myself. I'm trying to stand my ground. I don't know what's going on here. I'm telling this cop I need some help and he's trying to arrest me or something." Hall's family says police need to be monitored more, and that starts with the council listening to the concerns of those in the community. "Here we are standing today and we still do not have any evidence on my brother's case other than what we have all seen on television. What is it going to take for us to get information? What is it going to take for us to protect the brand of Frederick Hall the same way we are protecting the brand of the city of Raleigh?" said Hall's brother, Douglas. Hall is expected back in court next week on several charges, including assault, disorderly conduct and resisting arrest.
