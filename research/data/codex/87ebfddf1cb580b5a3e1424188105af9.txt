Log In PLAY VIDEO LOG IN Charlotte 'Black Lives Matter' Rally Calls For Police Accountability By Litsa Pappas Mecklenburg County PUBLISHED May 5, 2015 @1:48 AM SHARE CHARLOTTE -- The Charlotte chapter of the NAACP held a rally Monday for the Black Lives Matter movement. The group called for an end to police brutality following the death of Freddie Gray in Baltimore last month. More than 100 gathered in Marshall Park, calling for better police training after multiple investigations in to black men who died while in police custody around the country. The movement has intensified after Gray's death. The group wants to see police held accountable. So when six Baltimore police officers were charged last week, it was seen as a step in the right direction "We're concerned about the issues and we support them,” said state Rep. Rodney Moore, who has been working on a bill to give more power to citizen review boards in local government. He hopes North Carolina officers will soon have better diversity training.. "It's been a heavy lift but I always tell people this is a marathon this is not a sprint,” said Moore. The rally was part of the Moral Monday initiative, which began in North Carolina two years ago.
