Local activists on Monday asked city commissioners to call for the resignation of Orlando Police Officer Robert Schellhorn, whose use of offensive language put him at the center of two separate internal affairs investigations in 2017. "We have a saying: If you see something, say something. Well, we see something and we've been saying something for some time,” local activist T.J. Legacy-Cole said to city commissioners.

"We don't have the ability to do what you're asking us to do today,” Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer said. "Even if there are members up here who are sympathetic and think that's exactly what ought to be done... the final call was within the police command system, and we don't have the ability to change that at this point.” Advertisement Dyer called Schellhorn's actions "offensive and reprehensible” but said the City Council does not have the legal authority to impose punishment on police officers. According to OPD's union contract, recommendations for discipline must come through the agency's chain of command, beginning with lieutenant. Seven other activists asked the council to denounce the officer, who first came under fire in August 2017 after a social-media rant with racially charged language sparked a citizen complaint.

He used pepper spray while trying to break up a crowd after a fight. "This is typically Sunday night, it's just busy,” Schellhorn was heard saying to another officer on the footage. "All these [expletive] savages that [expletive] come out.” Schellhorn received an 80-hour unpaid suspension for each incident but opted to forfeit paid time off instead. The probe into the officer's comments at Parliament House emerged publicly in September of this year, adding to outrage of local activists, who, along with the Citizen's Police Review Board, believed the agency should fire Schellhorn over his social media comments. The board did not review the investigation of the officer's misconduct at the nightclub. An OPD spokesman said the probe was not initiated by a citizen complaint, but after a review of Schellhorn's body camera footage due to his use of pepper spray.

"Why bother to have Orlando Speaks, if someone can speak like this on social media and feel empowered and disgusting?” Sheehan said. "So if we can't do anything by state law, then we need to go to state legislature and say 'this is what's happening in our city.'” Orlando Speaks is a community forum for residents to talk with city leaders and police. Sheehan's comments were met with applause by the activists. She recommended the council address negotiating a change to OPD's off-duty work policies, saying the agency needs to revise its code of conduct to limit officers who have disciplinary problems from working extra duty.

"What I want you to understand, is that the system that you have in place right now, it doesn't work. And people don't feel safe,” Legacy-Cole said to council members.
