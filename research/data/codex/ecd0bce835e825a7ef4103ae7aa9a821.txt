Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Osaze Osagie were among the names of black individuals lifted in chants by the crowd.At 1 p.m., protestors marched eastbound on College Avenue before turning onto McAllister Street and continuing the march on Beaver Avenue. The march ultimately met at the State College Municipal Building, where individuals shared their thoughts and experiences to a crowd of hundreds.Individuals of all races, genders and ages held signs with statements such as, "I can't breathe,” "Love not hate” and "Black lives matter.”The event was organized and spread through social media by rising State College Area High School senior Lilyana Hasan. She said it was "really hard” to gain momentum when planning the event, and she did not expect the event to have more than 100 people.MORE COVERAGE SEE IT: State College Black Lives Matter protest State College community gathered in front of Allen Street Gates to hold a black lives matter... "I did not know it would travel this big, which is amazing,” Hasan said. "It is a beautiful thing that we are all here right now.”Hasan said she was inspired to organize the protest because of how often she saw injustices by the police on her television."Organizing a protest is a form of change and posting [on social media] is not enough,” Hasan said. "You have to speak out publicly.”Hasan said State College's Black Lives Matter protest was a prime example of a peaceful protest — the type of protest she reminded participants that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. died for.Hasan was in contact with the State College Police Department throughout the event. The police blocked off the roads that protesters marched down.No actions were taken by the police during the event.

Lindsey Toomer At the Allen Street Gates, State College resident Tierra Williams took it upon herself to direct the protest toward hearing black voices.Before the crowd began to march, Williams took the microphone from another protester who many felt was limiting black voices."Honestly, it wasn't until I snatched that mic away that people started realizing that even though white people are here and we appreciate your solidarity with us in this moment, it is not your space to speak,” Williams said. "Right now it's time to listen, but due to the embedded [and] systematic supremacy and privilege white people have, they felt that it was their need to somewhat take over this today.”Having lived in State College for about two and a half years, Williams said she has experienced racism in the workplace and at the grocery store. She added she once heard a "little child” call her son brown. Buy Now Tierra Williams speaks at a Black Lives Matter protest in honor of George Floyd at the Allen Street Gates Sunday, May 31, 2020.

"If we dress better, if we use the King's English, if we cut our hair and change our style, somehow, someway we will be accepted."But we're still dying no matter if we have on suits or we have locks in our hair.”Williams said she hopes that State College's Black Lives Matter protest will lead to progress and real change."I'm hoping that this event wasn't just for show, wasn't just because people aren't at work and don't have anything to do,” Williams said. "I really hope that they're going to pursue justice in this city and in the nation.”Students Alonzo Arizaga and Keegan Walker attended the protest and shared their personal experiences that led them there.
