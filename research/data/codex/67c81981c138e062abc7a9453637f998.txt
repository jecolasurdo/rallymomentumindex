Doe received a letter from Juan Guardia, the UC Dean of Students, stating he would be suspended effective Dec. 10, 2016 and will be eligible to re-enroll on Jan. 2, 2018.The students met on Tinder and had consensual sex at Doe's apartment, according to the lawsuit. The female student, identified only as Jane Roe, reported the incident to the university as a sexual assault about a month later, according to the suit.UC's Title IX coordinator questioned both students about the encounter, according to the lawsuit. The university held a hearing on June 27 and found Doe guilty of violating the Student Code of Conduct.Doe alleged in his lawsuit that the university never gave him a fair chance to defend himself because Roe was not at the hearing for him to question her. "Her right not to be there is guaranteed by Title IX,” said Grace Cunningham, a third-year sociology student and co-founder of Students for Survivors. "This shows Title IX finally working at UC.”On Nov. 16, Students for Survivors launched a petition to expel the offender permanently from the university."John Doe poses a direct threat to students' safety here on this campus,” reads the petition. "This sanction fails to uphold the Just Community Principles of the University of Cincinnati.” Students for Survivors will release demands to the university on Monday, according to Cunningham.UC has also failed survivors in other ways, according to Cunningham. For example, UC disbanded RECLAIM, a survivor's advocacy group, leaving survivors without proper advocacy for months, according to Cunningham.More than 400 Title IX complaints were filed in 2015, according to UC records obtained by the Enquirer. UC's Administrative Review Committee found only four individuals responsible and disciplined for committing physical abuse or harm.UC has tried to silence advocates, according to Cunningham."UC cares more about their reputation than your lives,” said Sam Katz, a third-year jazz studies student. This is both in cases of police brutality and campus rape, according to Katz.The two protests came together, forming a picket line across the bottom of UC's MainStreet and forcing normal foot traffic to go through them.A middle-aged man started an altercation with protesters and was escorted away by the UCPD.Protesters chanted, "Arrest that man.” However, the man was let go without arrest because UCPD did not see what actually happened, according to Robin Engel, head of the Community Advisory Council.The man attacked two female protesters, according to Brian Taylor, a Steering Committee member for BLMC.
