Protesters carried a variety of signs supporting a variety of specific causes including Standing Rock, women's rights, Black Lives Matter and several demanding a recount by the Electoral College. Horns from passing cars honked as the parade passed. "I'm a long way from Ferguson, but even on a small scale (Black Lives Matter) is still an important cause,” Eureka resident Shemya Vaughn said. "We want people to listen. Without them we can't have action.” The march, which was organized by the North Coast People's Alliance and other organizations, went down E Street and circled near the courthouse and ended at the gazebo in Old Town. The Eureka Police Department cleared parts of the street to allow for the march to take place. Vaughn, who is originally from St. Louis, Missouri, moved to Eureka this year. She said she heard about the protest from True North Organizing Network, a social justice organization in Del Norte and Humboldt Counties, and attended protest training earlier in the day. Other members of the protest marched with their families, including Therese Fitzmaurice who said she was with her 8-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter. "I'm concerned by Donald Trump's misogynistic language used prior to and during the election. Listening to him use that language and objectify women triggered a lot of terrible things for people I know who have been assaulted, abused or raped. It's a resurgence of rape culture and it's not OK,” Fitzmaurice said. "I felt a desire to publicly state how the rights of people have been violated according to the original declaration by the United Nations, and I'm here to make that declaration a beautiful vision of reality.” The United Nations approved the UN Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, which is marked every Dec. 10 as Human Rights Day. The march further celebrates rights including the right to a healthy environment; freedom from discrimination based on race, sex, religion, political opinion, country of origin, birth or status; the right for a prisoner to be free from torture or cruel or degrading treatment; the right to not be arbitrarily arrested, detained, or exiled; the right to an education; and the right to housing. Once the protesters arrived at the gazebo in Old Town, they were greeted by the Raging Grannies who sang modified versions of "When the Saints Go Marching In,” which included "Oh how I want to be in that number, when we have peace instead of war.” Among those chanting and singing was event co-organizer David Holper who talked to the crowd about his mother and grandmother escaping Nazi Germany. "My mother was thrown out of school, and her and my grandmother were forced to wear the Star of David before eventually fleeing Nazi Germany. It starts in small ways,” Holper said to the crowd of protestors before reading a poem by Clarissa Pinkola Estés called "Letter to A Young Activist During Troubled Times.” "I'm a teacher and I have been for about 30 years. I teach a whole range of students whether they're black, white, Hispanic or Hmong and I'm deeply concerned about young people having a right to education. Everyone I talk with is fearful of this new administration,” Holper said. Marcy Burstiner of the Humboldt Center for Constitutional Rights also spoke at the gazebo and said that even in California the government does not always recognize the right to protest. "When people (protest) in greater numbers, it is a powerful action. If you don't assemble, then government leaders can pretend you don't exist,” Burstiner said. Eureka residents like Renée Saucedo stepped up to the microphone accompanied by her 7-year-old son Carlos. She said her 82-year-old mother, who suffers from dementia, was detained and deported to Mexico two weeks ago. "They wouldn't even let me talk to her,” Saucedo said. "Mr. Trump is a walking human rights violation and any victory mounted on the backs of other people is not a victory at all. Immigrant rights are human rights.” Natalya Estrada can be reached at 707-441-0510.
