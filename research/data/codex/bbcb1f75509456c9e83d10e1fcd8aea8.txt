Updated: 2:38 PM EDT Jun 1, 2020 Destruction and looting filled the streets of downtown Boston for several hours Sunday night, forcing police to call in reinforcements from the National Guard, State Police and surrounding communities. Boston police said as of early Monday morning, approximately 53 arrests had been made, with 9 officers transported to area hospitals for injuries. Police said several officers were also treated on the scene, following a violent night across many parts of downtown Boston and the Back Bay. Multiple demonstrations had gathered in Boston peacefully throughout the day, lending their voices to the nationwide anger sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died on Memorial Day after being pinned to the ground by the knee of a white Minneapolis police officer.The atmosphere downtown changed dramatically after sunset, however, when a crowd of thousands began to disperse from the State House.Boston Police were seen using pepper spray and hitting a man with a baton in Downtown Crossing just after 9 p.m., after officers were pelted with water bottles and other objects. Several tense hours followed, and 21 police cruisers were damaged during the incidents. Looting was seen at multiple stores in the area, including in Downtown Crossing, on Newbury Street and at the Copley Place mall over the next several hours. In many of the incidents, looters were seen jumping through the smashed windows and taking products from the stores on live TV. State police said they arrested one person shortly before 9:30 p.m. for scaling the fence at the State House.Soon after, troopers said they were called to assist an MBTA Transit Police officer whose cruiser was surrounded by the angry crowd. Troopers said they fired pepper ball projectiles at the aggressors to make it possible for the officer to drive away. Around 10 p.m., during a live report, an SUV went through the crowd and appeared to hit several people. The incident occurred on Tremont Street while reporter Peter Eliopoulos was describing the chaotic scene there."Several people just got hit," he said. "Several people just run over by a car. The front windshield was shattered." Elsewhere, protesters damaged multiple police vehicles with graffiti, by smashing windows and setting at least one on fire. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh issued a statement commending those who had participated in the peaceful protests during the day but expressing anger at those who resorted to violence. "I am angered," he wrote. "By the people who came into our city and chose to engage in acts of destruction and violence, undermining their message. If we are to achieve change and if we are to lead the change, our efforts must be rooted in peace and regard for our community." Gov. Baker issued a similar message, supporting the protest but denouncing the violence."I also want to express my gratitude to all the police officers and other first responders working to protect the people of Boston from the individuals whose violent actions, looting and property destruction was criminal and cowardly – and distracted from the powerful statement made today by thousands of Massachusetts residents," Baker said.
