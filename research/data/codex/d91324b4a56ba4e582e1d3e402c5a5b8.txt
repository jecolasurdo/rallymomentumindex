Security keeping them away from field. pic.twitter.com/EN5OimGCqG — John Schriffen (@JohnSchriffen) September 24, 2016 Graffiti was discovered Tuesday on the Ypsilanti campus. It included the letters "KKK” — an apparent reference to the Ku Klux Klan — and another message including a racial epithet. Eastern Michigan President James Smith said in a statement that the university "strongly condemns such a racist and thoughtless act.” Smith adds that he hopes nearby security cameras will provide evidence. The graffiti was removed. Arm in arm, #BlackLivesMatter protesters take field after #EasternMichigan game.
