The protest came in the wake of a video that emerged last week of police beating an Ethiopian Israeli in an army uniform. About 3,000 people participated in Sunday's protest, according to Israel Police spokesperson Micky Rosenfeld. He said it was mostly peaceful, but added that there were some minor scuffles with police. Protesters blocked roads in central Tel Aviv and a main highway leading to the city.

A police statement on Facebook said 20 officers have been injured in clashes with protestors, and social media images from Tel Aviv showed damaged police and other vehicles.

The first rally last week in Jerusalem turned violent. Protestors on Sunday marched in Tel Aviv, with some blowing whistles or chanting, "Violent police officers belong in jail." Many used the Twitter hashtag, #BlackLivesMatter, which spread across the U.S. in the wake of controversial police actions against black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and most recently in Baltimore, where six police officers were charged Friday in the death of unarmed black man Freddie Gray.

Thousands of Ethiopian Jews live in Israel, many of them secretly airlifted into the country in 1984 and 1990, but their absorption into Israeli society has been rocky.
