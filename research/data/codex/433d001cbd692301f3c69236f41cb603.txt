Peaceful demonstrations against the police for the killing of an unarmed Black man turned to looting and fires Wednesday, as Target, Aldi, Autozone and Cub Foods on Lake Street were all ransacked in a scene of mayhem. For the second day, demonstrators came out to protest the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody Monday; in a widely shared video, Officer Derek Chauvin could be seen with his knee in Floyd's neck just before his death. The inside of the Target is smoky; people are trying to break into the cash registers. Alarm is blaring pic.twitter.com/qfd97sfNTr — Ricardo Lopez (@rljourno) May 28, 2020 The chaos took place in two theaters. At the Minneapolis Police Department's 3rd Precinct, demonstrators barricaded themselves behind Target carts and threw objects at the precinct, while police returned fire with tear gas and rubber bullets. Meanwhile, further east, looters took advantage of the lack of police presence, breaking into stores and setting fires. Meanwhile, Target still being looted. It's been over 3 hours. Many are wearing masks. pic.twitter.com/LZ4dAGHgMT — Max Nesterak (@maxnesterak) May 28, 2020 THE MORNING NEWSLETTER Subscribe now.
