Allison Lee Isley/Journal Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save A local group of 20 demonstrators called on the city Friday afternoon to immediately remove the Confederate statue at the corner of Fourth and Liberty streets in downtown Winston-Salem.At the same time, six supporters of the statue yelled at the demonstrators who stood next to the statue on Liberty Street. The statue supporters carried the U.S. flag, Confederate battle flag, the Mississippi state flag, and the yellow Gadsden "Don't Tread on Me” flag.Organizers of the group, Get Hate Out of Winston, conducted a news conference and rally at the site of the statue. The events were peaceful, but loud at times. Both sides traded insults. Will Cox, a demonstrator who opposes the statue, said the monument stands against black people."That's its history,” Cox said.That's when Jenna Bernstein of Tampa, Fla., a statue supporter, walked through the group of demonstrators who want the statue to be removed, stopped and talked loudly about the research of Carter G. Woodson, a black historian in the 20th century. Bernstein asserted that Woodson maintained that some black people participated in the economic system of slavery by owning slaves."That is a U.S. veterans war memorial,” Bernstein yelled to the anti-statue demonstrators. "Dr. King would have never desecrated an American war memorial like this with your ignorance and your socialism."This is America, a constitutional republic,” Bernstein said. "United we stand, divided we fall. God bless you. You have a right to assembly. We have a right to a free discussion. I love you. I am not a racist.”Bernstein then crossed Fourth Street with her fellow statue supporters and stood near the city's historic marker that commemorates the sit-in at the former Woolworth's store on Liberty Street in 1960 during the civil rights movement.Bernstein brought a large American flag to the event and shouted slogans such as "one flag, one people, one country,” "God bless the USA,” and "Communists and socialists will not win.”At one point, pro-statue protesters began chanting "all lives matter,” getting a response of "black lives matter” from the anti-statue protesters.Lillian Podlog, organizer of the news conference and rally, spoke to fellow demonstrators."We are here today to keep the pressure on the city to make sure that this statue comes down,” Podlog said. "This statue is a symptom of white supremacy. White supremacy is the disease that erected it."White supremacy has kept the statue standing,” Podlog said. "And when the statue comes down, we will have dealt with a nasty side effect of this disease, but the systems of white supremacy will still be churning.”Aidan McCarthy, a student at Reagan High School and another speaker at the rally, thanked local people who worked in the effort to get the city to remove the statue."This day was a long time coming, and it sends a clear message, from Winston to Charlottesville and to the handful of students at my school, Reagan High School, that racism and fascism will not be tolerated in our community,” McCathy said. "And while I'm thankful to the city council for their unwillingness to bend to the demands of the Lost Cause, this day is for the people of this city who came out and decided that the statue represents hatred, lies and oppression, and did something about it.”City officials started discussing the fate of the statue immediately after the violence in Charlottesville, Va., on Aug. 12, 2017. The Ku Klux Klan, neo-Nazis and pro-Confederate groups protested that city's decision to try to remove the statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee in a downtown park. Counter-protesters confronted the white nationalists, and people on both sides fought.Friday's activity at the statue site happened a day after Judge Stanley Allen of Forsyth Superior Court rejected a request by the United Daughters of the Confederacy to stop the city of Winston-Salem from removing the Confederate statue. Allen also ruled that the UDC's lawsuit, which it filed Thursday against the city of Winston-Salem and Forsyth County, can proceed through the court system. The UDC raised $3,000 to erect the statue at its current location. It was unveiled in October 1905.If there were any legal steps left for the United Daughters of the Confederacy to try to stop the removal of the statue, they didn't take them on Friday.City officials said that the statue will be taken down next week. The city said no removal would take place over the weekend."We are still developing a plan,” said Assistant City Manager Damon Dequenne, who is heading up the city's arrangements to move the statue.Dequenne said he had no timetable yet, and that the statue's removal would be done carefully and professionally."We are going to do this in a respectful, safe and preservation-minded manner,” Dequenne said.The statue has been vandalized twice since August 2017. It also has been the scene of other protests with supporters who want it to remain and opponents who want it removed.The city will put the statue in storage until it can be moved to the private Salem Cemetery near Old Salem, whose board has agreed to take the monument.Salem Cemetery has the graves of many prominent Winston-Salem families. It also has a section where 36 Confederate veterans are buried in orderly rows near each other with identically-designed tombstones, originating when Civil War veterans here decided to be buried next to their comrades.Mayor Allen Joines has suggested that putting the Confederate monument near those Civil War graves would be a more appropriate way to remember the area's Civil War dead.The news conference and rally of the anti-statue activists lasted about 30 minutes. After they left the scene, the statue supporters then crossed Fourth Street and gathered next to the statue.As Bernstein was speaking to reporters and photographers, Zach Fulton of Winston-Salem began cursing the statue supporters. Police Capt. Mike Weaver then approached Fulton, telling him not to create a commotion.After speaking with Weaver, Fulton then turned and watched the statue supporters. As Bernstein spoke, Fulton interrupted her, saying, "It's too bad that you are scared because of equality. What are you afraid of?”"Why are so many of you so hateful?” Fulton asked those who were there to support the statue. "This thing is going away, and so are you.”Bernstein urged the statue supporters not to respond to Fulton.However, Michael Riggles of Lexington, who had held the Gadsden flag, said to Fulton, "You can't erase history, buddy.” Confederate Statue Press Conference Jenna Bernstein (left), a supporter of the Confederate statue, shouts her views as Lillian Podlog tries to speak during a press conference held by the Hate Out of Winston group at the Confederate monument Friday afternoon, Feb. 1, 2019, at the corner of Fourth and Liberty streets in downtown Winston-Salem, N.C.
