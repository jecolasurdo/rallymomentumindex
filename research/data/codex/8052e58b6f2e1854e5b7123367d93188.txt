"These protests across America, including here in Los Angeles, are about our country's biggest and most unresolved sin - racism. We need to be focused on change through peaceful and fervent protest. Unfortunately, that is not what we are seeing tonight. We need to destroy hate, not our communities."The Associated Press and City News Service contributed to this report.
