Clapping and chanting echoed through the walls of a packed City Council chambers while dozens honored outgoing Vice Mayor Suja Lowenthal on her final night on the dais. Some protestors made it inside City Hall and lined up at the podium to share their thoughts and concerns with city officials. Resident Anna Wagner, who lives in the 5th District, stood at the podium with her infant daughter River Grace, saying black people deserve dignity and respect. "Hearing the chief of police speak about compassion is really outrageous given the amount of police brutality that people of color have faced in this city,” she said, before calling for independent oversight of the police department. Byron Barnett said his god-brother was killed by police while unarmed. "There are a lot of civil rights that are broke here on a daily basis,” he said. "It's a serious issue.” "I want to be able, for one time in my life, to see a police officer and feel relief,” he continued. "I've never felt that before.” About a dozen residents, black and white, called for more transparency and independent police oversight as well as training on anti-bias and de-escalation. The protest comes amid heightened tensions across the country as communities continue to protest police shootings of unarmed black men. It also falls on the same day as a memorial service for five police officers killed by a lone sniper at a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas last week. The Dallas attack ended with the gunman, Micah Johnson, 25, blown up by a bomb delivered by a police robot. The black Army veteran portrayed his attack on the officers as payback for the fatal police shootings of black men in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and suburban Minneapolis. Portions of both shootings were videotaped and broadcast nationwide, leading to fresh outrage, protests and scores of arrests. The killings also put the country on edge, heightened racial tensions and pushed the issue of the use of deadly force against black males by white police to the forefront. Several protests have been staged through the nation and region in the last week, including a protest at Los Angeles City Hall Tuesday after a police panel declined to fault officers in the 2015 shooting of a 30-year-old black woman.
