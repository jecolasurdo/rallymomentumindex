(2:08)FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmailDec 3, 2017ESPN.com staffFacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerPinterestEmailprintPhiladelphia Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins does not plan to protest during the national anthem in Week 13, after the NFL and the Players Coalition, which Jenkins co-founded, this week joined in a partnership that calls for the league to contribute $89 million over seven years to projects dealing with criminal justice reform, law enforcement/community relations and education. Jenkins had raised his fist during the national anthem for every game since Week 2 of the 2016 season. Jenkins said he was unaware whether his teammates or other members of the Players Coalition, a group of 40-plus men from across the league, will cease their demonstrations.President Donald Trump last month bashed a plan that would keep NFL teams in the locker room during the national anthem, saying it is "almost as bad as kneeling." Trump has also criticized free-agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick -- who launched the wave of protests during the anthem last season when he kneeled to protest police brutality against African-Americans and other issues -- on multiple occasions and made claims that players who protest during the anthem should be suspended or released. Several players and coaches reacted strongly to Trump on social media, and players -- joined by coaches and owners, in some instances -- across the league knelt, locked arms, raised their fists and even refused to come out of the locker room during the national anthem in Week 3. There have been several more protests since.Previous protests this season, by week: 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | PreseasonHere are the players who protested in Week 13 (most recent updates first):Seattle Seahawks: Michael Bennett and seven other members of the Seahawks' defensive line again sat on the bench during the national anthem before Sunday night's game against the Eagles. Those sitting in addition to Bennett were: Dion Jordan, Sheldon Richardson, Frank Clark, Quinton Jefferson, Jarran Reed, Marcus Smith II and Branden Jackson. Left tackle Duane Brown took a knee, as he has been doing, while center Justin Britt again stood next to him with a supportive hand on Brown's shoulder. -- Brady HendersonNew York Giants: Olivier Vernon continued to be the only Giants player to protest, kneeling during the anthem before Sunday's game against the Raiders. It was his fourth game back after missing four games with an ankle injury. Vernon has done so at every game since Week 3 in Philadelphia. He said recently he plans to continue kneeling until the real message behind the protests is understood by the public. -- Jordan RaananLos Angeles Chargers: Left tackle Russell Okung stood with the rest of his teammates during the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Browns, raising his right fist for the second straight week. Okung had not raised his fist the two weeks before that as the NFL honored the military, but he did earlier this season. Okung said Friday that despite an agreement in principle between the NFL and the Players Coalition to address criminal justice reform, he will continue to protest during the national anthem on game days. He attended a meeting in October with NFL owners and commissioner Roger Goodell to discuss how the league would handle anthem protests. Earlier this season, Okung wrote an open letter to other NFL players on The Players' Tribune, with the goal of overcoming "uncharted territory" by opening a line of communication and responding with "one voice‚Äù as players. -- Eric D. WilliamsOakland Raiders: Running back Marshawn Lynch remained seated during the national anthem before the Raiders' game against the Giants. He has remained seated during the national anthem all season, and he stood for the Mexican national anthem two weeks ago in the Raiders' game in Mexico City. Lynch has not said why he has remained seated during the national anthem. He wore a T-shirt before the team's Week 4 game that read "EVERYBODY -VS- TRUMP." -- Paul GutierrezLos Angeles Rams: Outside linebacker Robert Quinn put his right fist in the air during the national anthem before the Rams' game against the Cardinals. Punter Johnny Hekker put his arm around Quinn as a show of support. Running back Todd Gurley and wide receiver Tavon Austin linked arms once again. -- Alden GonzalezNew Orleans Saints: Most of the Saints players briefly knelt in unity before the national anthem against the Panthers, as they have done in their past eight games. They then all stood during the anthem, with some players and coaches locking arms. -- Mike TriplettKansas City Chiefs: Cornerback Marcus Peters came out of the tunnel after the national anthem was over before the Chiefs' game against the Jets. This is the fifth game in a row he has done this. Peters had previously sat on a bench on the sideline for the anthem this season. -- Adam TeicherMiami Dolphins: Wide receiver Kenny Stills, safety Michael Thomas and tight end Julius Thomas took a knee on the field during the national anthem before the Dolphins' game against the Broncos. The trio previously stayed in the locker room for the anthem against the Jets in Week 8, but they have kneeled the past few weeks. Dolphins coach Adam Gase had established a team rule requiring players to either stand for the anthem or stay in the tunnel, but Gase recently told players that if they wanted to come out and kneel, they could do it and they won't be punished for it. -- James WalkerSan Francisco 49ers: Three 49ers players -- receiver Marquise Goodwin, safety Eric Reid and linebacker Eli Harold -- knelt during the anthem before Sunday's game against Chicago in their ongoing protest against racial inequality in the country. Wide receiver Louis Murphy stood behind them with his right fist in the air. -- Nick WagonerTennessee Titans: Wide receiver Rishard Matthews, who is inactive for the second straight game because of a hamstring injury, stayed in the locker room during the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Texans. He has protested by remaining in the locker room during the anthem for every game since Week 3, with Week 10 being an exception due to Veterans Day. -- Cameron WolfeNote: Baltimore Ravens rookie linebacker Tyus Bowser was originally included in this post after he knelt in prayer in the end zone for the beginning part of the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Lions. Bowser wasn't protesting, however. He said it was a routine that he's been doing since high school, and the Ravens were late getting on the field, which led to his prayer extending into the anthem.
