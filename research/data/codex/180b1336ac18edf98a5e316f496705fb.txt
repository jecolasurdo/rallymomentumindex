They say they were protesting police brutality against African Americans, and President Elect Donald Trump's policies.It was a two mile march that ended at Rockdale Park. People gathered there to write down ideas on what can be done to improve race relations in America. The ideas will be sent to elected officials across the county. People taking part in the march say having an open dialogue about race issues in America is a good start to addressing the issues.Catherine Caitlin says, "It seems to me that there's a huge disparity in the way police react to black people vs white people. So I think until black lives can matter, no lives can matter."March organizer Sue Wilson says, "I feel this is not just a black person's problem. The immigrants are being [targeted]. Anybody who is different than white is all of a sudden being targeted.”Members of Dubuque's NAACP chapter also took part in the march.Chapter President Anthony Allen says, "There's a large percent of white Americans that understand that all lives do matter. And right now we're currently concentrating on black lives, and that's what the march is for. To recognize that we do understand that all lives matter, but today in America black lives are suffering greatly."Latest NewsVOD RecordingIowa's unemployment rate dropped to 10 percent in MayUpdated: Jun. 22, 2020 at 11:00 AM CDTIowa's unemployment rate dropped slightly to 10% in May.
