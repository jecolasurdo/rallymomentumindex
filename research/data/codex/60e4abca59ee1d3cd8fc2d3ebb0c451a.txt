When Whitehead cited city rules to prevent Ewing from sharing the prepared statement, Pulley stood up and began speaking directly to Whitehead."She has a right — a First Amendment right — to talk," Pulley said.Whitehead responded by saying that Pulley was out of order and at one point called for a police officer to intervene."You're out of order," Pulley retorted, pointing at Whitehead.Whitehead prompted the council to move on to other matters when Pulley referred to the mayor's now-deleted Facebook post.Whitehead became the mayor of Woodcreek — a city north of Wimberley with about 1,700 residents, according to census estimates — in 2019 through an uncontested race. Her term is set to end November 2021.She posted on Tuesday a message criticizing the Black Lives Matter movement as a socialist attempt to take over lives and a threat to the country, the Wimberley View reported. She said it has done nothing but denounce America and uses guilt, shame and "the race card.""I'm not a racist!! I'll not bow down to this insane show....wakeup to save America. All Lives Matter," Whitehead said in the post, according to KXAN.Pulley, who left the meeting in protest of Whitehead's actions, said he does not believe city rules prevent residents from speaking about their concerns about an elected official."I'm an attorney, I know better than that. Our city lawyer knows better than that," he said. "You have a right to talk to your government."Pulley said he was happy to see protesters show up to voice their discontent with current leadership."That's America right there, my friend," he said.Ewing, who also left the meeting after she was prevented from speaking, said she strongly disagrees with Whitehead's comments, adding that she felt silenced and robbed of her right to speak."These statements that she made were so inappropriate and so off target," Ewing said. "We need people to be educated, beginning with her."The special-called meeting on Wednesday was held in person, and required those inside the meeting room to sign in and have a temperature check. One city official told the American-Statesman that the city had limited seating for the meeting due to social distancing requirements for COVID-19.Outside City Hall, more than a dozen protesters with signs called for Whitehead's resignation. Ewing said at least two different organizations, Wimberley Democrats and Wimberley Indivisible, had helped organize the protest.Carlos Quezada, who protested outside of the council meeting on Wednesday, said he does not feel well represented by Whitehead."When she starts calling people a threat, and calling the movement socialist to try to dehumanize us and demonize us, I don't know what she's trying to do," Quezada said.Nan Simpson, who said she has lived in the area for 14 years, said she barely has the words to describe how she feels about Whitehead's comments."It's just embarrassing to have a mayor that sounds like an uneducated person," Simpson said.
