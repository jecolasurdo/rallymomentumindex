We do not negotiate with terrorists, i.e. racists, police and etc. A BLACK WOMAN organized the counter protest and we supported. But, for FOX26 to interview random Black people and call them "Black Lives Matter" is completely unprofessional. According to people who attended the counter protest ORGANIZED BY A BLACK WOMAN: "He was trying to control the counter protest tonight by saying we need to sit down with the blue lives matter ppl and have a discussion. When any black men or women tried explaining that they're not gonna sit with their oppressors, he was quick to either talk over them, be extremely disrespectful, and even threatened violence bc they didnt agree with him bc by doing that is being "disrespectful" to him. Then we saw him with an arm band that the police gave him. Then he accused BLM of being "paid". He said this in front of a lot of ppl a few times. That triggered me so I told him if BLM is paid then why did u rely on them to get u out of jail last week-He told me that u and Brandon got him out. That set him off bc then I was a bitch, I'm paid too, & he got in my face like he wanted to fight & I'm wondering why he got so mad from me speaking the truth bc I know y'all got him out. Men even had to check him. He was chumming it up with the cops before he left. He definitely made sure he was in front of cameras claiming "he's trying to be the voice of reason" with the blue lives ppl. He'll probably be on the news tonight. I was already suspicious last week. Telling those ppl we should sit down, have a beer together and discuss our differences then tone policing other black lives who had legitimate reason to be angry just sends red flags all over the place." https://www.fox26houston.com/vid.../698118 See More English (US)Espa√±olFran√ßais (France)‰∏≠Êñá(ÁÆÄ‰Ωì)ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©Portugu√™s (Brasil)ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥ItalianoDeutsch‡§π‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ÄÊó•Êú¨Ë™ûSign UpLog InMessengerFacebook Lite Watch PeoplePagesPage CategoriesPlacesGamesLocationsMarketplaceFacebook PayGroupsOculusPortalInstagramLocalFundraisersServicesAboutCreate AdCreate PageDevelopersCareersPrivacyCookiesAd ChoicesTermsHelpSettingsActivity Log Facebook ¬© 2020
