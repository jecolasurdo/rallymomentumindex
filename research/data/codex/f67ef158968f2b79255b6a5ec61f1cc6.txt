"Get him out of here. Throw him out!”ADAt one point, Southall fell to the ground and was surrounded by several white men who appeared to be kicking and punching him, according to video captured by CNN. A Washington Post reporter in the crowd watched as one of the men put his hands on Southall's neck and heard a female onlooker repeatedly shout: "Don't choke him!”ADAs security officers got Southall on his feet and led him out of the building, he was repeatedly pushed and shoved by people in the crowd. The crowd alternated between booing and cheering. There were chants of "All lives matter!”Conservative suspicions of refugees grow in wake of Paris attacks"Maybe he should have been roughed up, because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing,” Trump said on the Fox News Channel on Sunday morning. "I have a lot of fans, and they were not happy about it. And this was a very obnoxious guy who was a trouble-maker who was looking to make trouble.”ADThat was a change in tone from just a month ago, when Trump would regularly tell his audiences not to harm the protesters who often infiltrate his rallies."Don't hurt 'em,” Trump said at a rally in Miami on Oct. 23 as pro-immigration activists were led out. "You can get 'em out, but don't hurt 'em.”ADThe Republican front-runner has long made provocative statements a hallmark of his campaign. Critics and rivals have said that Trump is stoking racial tension. Former Florida governor Jeb Bush said Trump's comments about Islam are "manipulating people's angst and their fears.”Saturday's racially charged altercation occurred in Birmingham, famous in the 1960s as a center of the civil rights struggle. The thousands who attended Trump's rally were nearly all white in a city with a black majority.ADSouthall told the AL.com news site that the commotion started as he began recording himself and other protesters at the rally and saying that he wanted "Donald Trump to know he's not welcome here.” Southall said someone knocked the phone out of his hand and made a racial slur. Then there was pushing and punches started flying, Southall told the news site.ADA swarm of security officers quickly made their way through the crowd of several thousand, got Southall off the ground and walked him out of the building. Trump has had Secret Service protection since Nov. 11, and those who attend his rallies and political events must now walk through metal detectors and have their bags searched."He was so obnoxious and so loud, he was screaming,” Trump recounted in the Fox News interview on Sunday. "I had 10,000 people in the room yesterday, 10,000 people, and this guy started screaming by himself.”AD[Anti-Islam rhetoric increases on GOP campaign trail]As Southall was removed Saturday, Trump recounted how Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders responded to Black Lives Matter activists who came onstage during an event earlier this year."You see, he was politically correct,” Trump said. "Two young women came up to the podium. They took over his microphone. I promise you, that's not going to happen with me. I promise you. Never going to happen. Not going to happen. Can't let that stuff happen.”ADBefore the fight broke out, Trump had warned the audience that Islamic State fighters might recruit their children online and called for an impenetrable wall along the southern border, prompting the crowd to chant: "Build a wall! Build a wall! Build a wall!” In his nearly hour-long speech, Trump listed graphic details of killings committed by people who had entered the country illegally, promised to bar Syrian refugees from living in the United States because they might be terrorists and called for heavy surveillance of "certain mosques.”AD"I want surveillance of these people that are coming in, the Trojan horse. I want to know who the hell they are,” Trump said. "I don't want the people from Syria coming in, because we don't know who they are. We don't know who they are. And I don't want them coming in.”Trump also said he watched as "thousands and thousands of people” in New Jersey cheered the fall of the World Trade Center on Sept. 11, 2001, giving the impression that he was talking about Muslims living in the United States being happy that so many Americans died in the attacks. Officials have repeatedly debunked these rumors. Trump stood by his comments during an interview on ABC News on Sunday, saying that the cheers came from the "large Arab populations” in New Jersey.AD"It did happen. I saw it,” Trump said. "It was on television. I saw it.”AD[Donald Trump calls for heavy surveillance of "certain mosques"]From the media area, reporters strained to see what was happening Saturday at the Trump event here in Birmingham. As CNN reporter Jeremy Diamond managed to make a video of the incident before Trump staff forced him back into the media pen. As the video circulated on social media that night, some of Trump's supporters took to Twitter to call the protesters "thugs,” "Dem plants” and a variety of obscene names. Several wrote that the protesters opened themselves up to the possibility of violence by attending the rally.[Nine things that happened during Donald Trump's rally in Worcester]ADTrump grew agitated as reporters shifted their focus to the protesters and away from him and his thousands of supporters.AD"Look at those bloodsuckers back there,” Trump said. "They're turned around, and they're following the people, right? Because you have a small group of people that made some noise and are being thrown out on their ass. Right?”The crowd roared with cheers.Amber Phillips contributed to this report.Today's HeadlinesThe most important news stories of the day, curated by Post editors and delivered every morning.By signing up you agree to our Terms of Use and Privacy PolicyComments are not available on this story.Share your feedback by emailing the author.
