Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save A coalition of groups marched on Friday from the police headquarters at Eighth and Race streets to the District Attorney's office at 3 S. Penn Square, in protest of the police shooting of David Jones, an African-American man who was shot in the back while riding a motor bike.The groups included members of Black Lives Matter, Black Clergy of Philadelphia and Vicinity, National Action Network, Socialist Alternative and Techbook Online.The Rev. Mark Kelly Tyler, pastor of Mother Bethel AME church, who was marching with the Coalition for Justice for David Jones, described part of the day's events, including one portion of the march when he said a white police officer wielded his bicycle as a weapon, swung it to hit another marcher but wound up striking Tyler. He said he saw a Black officer getting into verbal confrontations with Jones' brother, Anthony.

"But to me, when you are the person with the gun on your hip, you have the greater responsibility. You have been granted that by having been given a badge. If you are a cop and you chose to work this detail, you need to be better equipped to handle people upset over situations like this.”Jones was shot in the back on June 8 by police officer Ryan Pownall. Jones, 30, had a gun on him when Pownall stopped him for operating an illegal dirt bike. Two differing stories about the incident have emerged as there was a witness to the shooting in Pownhall's car at the time.Philadelphia Police Commissioner Richard Ross has said Pownall's decision to shoot Jones in the back "gives me pause.”The crowd marching to the D.A's office was no larger than 30. However there were more than 100 police stationed along the way. A number of streets were blocked off. Police trucks with "Counter Terrorism” written on the side were parked in front of the D.A.'s office awaiting the arrival of the band of marchers.Tyler said the police presence for the march was excessive, and stated he witnessed officers overreacting and "not carrying themselves in a professional manner.”The pastor said he believed the police should have reduced their numbers when it was clear that the rally had not attracted a larger crowd."It was unnecessary and so over the top,” Tyler said. "I would love to meet with commissioner Ross because this is setting up to be a powder keg.”He also recounted how at Eighth and Market when a white man walking with him in solidarity was heckled by another white man."Someone said to him, 'why are you walking with those niggers?'” said Tyler. They walked a little further and came upon what Tyler said was "an all-white crew” of construction workers at the site of the Gallery."They started to get into it with us,” Tyler said. "It clearly had a racial edge to it. Hey, emotions are high and things are at a fever pitch. David Jones' brother was marching with us. He has a fresh wound. His brother was shot and killed last month, so you can expect emotions to be running high.”While he did not get Ross, Police Chief Inspector Melvin Singleton did address the situation. Particularly, he addressed claims by the protestors that his men were excessive in their actions and that they attempted to antagonize Anthony Jones. Jones was clearly upset."Not at all,” Singleton said.According to police, Jones died shortly thereafter at Temple University Hospital. The police said Jones was shot in the back and buttocks as he ran south on the 4200 block of Whitaker Ave.However, a witness who was in Pownhall's car, Terrance F, in an interview with The Tribune said he and his children were riding in the back of Pownhall's patrol car on the day of the incident. Terrance had called police after he said his son went missing and later turned up about two hours after.The witness said Pownhall tasered Jones before shooting him, and that the officer went to Jones and said "I'm taking your s%5Et.”"The officer pulls out a service weapon and I hear three shots,” Terrance recounted. "I look, and Mr. Jones was on the ground laying 20 to 30 feet behind the police SUV.”In 2010, Pownall shot fleeing suspect Carnell Williams-Carney, who also had a gun, in the back. The shooting left Williams-Carney paralyzed. He lost a civil suit as a 2013 federal jury said the city and police did not violate his civil rights. jmitchell@phillytrib.com (215) 893-5732 Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save More information +5 District attorney: Ex-officer Pownall faces homicide charge in police-involved shooting A former Philadelphia police officer who shot and killed a 30-year-old African-American man as he fled from a traffic stop has been charged wi...
