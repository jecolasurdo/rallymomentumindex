Milwaukee police and sheriff's deputies made dozens of arrests in relation to the protests. The peaceful protests turned disruptive as about a hundred people headed to the interstate. Two groups broke off -- blocking on-ramps and chanting with bullhorns. Those protesters were met by police and one by one, they were arrested. The Milwaukee County Sheriff's Office says 73 adults and one juvenile were arrested Friday evening.

A short time later on McKinley Ave., there were more arrests including one member of the Hamilton family. Despite the arrests, the group vowed to continue the disobedience as long as was necessary. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett issued the following statement Friday evening on the protests: "I'm angry and disappointed that the individuals involved in tonight's protests decided to take their demonstration to the interstate and disrupt the lawful flow of traffic and jeopardize the safety of citizens. The Milwaukee Police Department has shown commendable and considerable restraint in policing all of the protest activities to date. "Tonight's demonstration, however, crossed the line of lawful protest and put the lives of the demonstrators and the general public in harm's way. Those individuals actively engaged in such activity should be arrested and charged."

Protesters hoped to put pressure on the District Attorney to make a charging decision soon. That said, the Hamilton family has also said they do not want a decision before Christmas, saying it will ruin their holiday. Milwaukee County Sheriff David Clarke issued a statement Friday afternoon, asking for the public's help to report disruptions. His statement said: "I want to alert the public of information that has come to our attention regarding the potential of disruptive tactics. A credible source has informed us that several anarchist groups led by outside persons, are gathering in the Milwaukee area to plan disruptive activities both before and after the decision by Milwaukee County DA John Chisholm regarding the Dontre Hamilton case. "The information indicates that the groups have exploited the tragic situation involving the death of Mr. Hamilton, to destabilize daily activities of law-abiding citizens in public and private spaces open to the public. This includes the use of blockades on the interstate system and around other roadways to prevent law enforcement from responding quickly to emergency situations." 31-year-old Hamilton was shot and killed by (now fired) Milwaukee Police Officer, Christopher Manney, in Red Arrow Park back in April. Since late April, the Hamilton family has been waiting to hear whether former officer Christopher Manney will be charged in this case. Manney has already been fired for action leading up to the shooting of Hamilton. The District Attorney has previously said he's waiting for the conclusion of several investigations before making a decision about charges.

And what if that person died because they could not get them to the hospital because these people were blocking the freeway? Would they be brought up on charges?
