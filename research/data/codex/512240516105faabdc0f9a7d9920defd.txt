(KOIN) — Demonstrators once again took to the streets of Portland on Wednesday in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Many events took place throughout the day, from a community bike ride to marches and rallies. The night ended once again with an agitated crowd outside the Justice Center fence. Some people pulled down the fence around the federal courthouse building and dragged it over to the Justice Center. Police ordered people to leave after "criminal activity occurred in the crowd” and threatened to use crowd control munitions. A federal judge on Tuesday granted a temporary restraining order limiting the PPB's use of tear gas on demonstrators. Portland's 13th day of protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, who died while a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck, follows a "day of rest” in which protesters listened to speeches in Southeast Portland in lieu of marching. Here is a timeline of events from Wednesday, June 10, 2020: 2 a.m. Portland police tweeted that the group around Southwest Main Street and Third Avenue dispersed on their own by 2 a.m. 11:15 p.m. Officers are telling "nonviolent protesters” to leave the area because there is "criminal activity occurring in the crowd.” Police say they will use crowd control munitions on those who throw projectiles over the fence or tamper with/cut the fence. Paper airplanes are littering the ground inside the fence. They are sample resignation letters for officers created by protesters. By 11:30 p.m., protesters reportedly knocked down a portion of the fence at Southwest Main and Third Avenue. Police said they used crowd control munitions at that point in order to ensure no protesters entered the secured area.
