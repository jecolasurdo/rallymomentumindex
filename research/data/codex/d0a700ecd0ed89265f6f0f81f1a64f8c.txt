Their mistakes could have led to disaster. Coronavirus Friday update: 17 more Minnesota deaths and 356 new cases Hundreds of Black Lives Matter protesters disrupted service at Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport on the biggest holiday travel day of the year after briefly gathering for what organizers called a "diversion” Wednesday at the Mall of America. Protesters forced the closure of security checkpoints at Humphrey Terminal 2 and blocked roadways leading into Humphrey and Lindbergh Terminal 1. Some flights were delayed and some travelers missed their flights. No flights were canceled, but airport operations were disrupted for about 90 minutes on a day when 120,000 people were expected to fly in and out of the MSP terminals. "It was a busy day anyway,” said MSP spokesman Patrick Hogan. "Adding the presence of the protesters slowed things down even further.” On Twitter, Black Lives Matter organizers called a previously announced 1:30 p.m. demonstration at the Mall of America a "planned diversion.” Three minutes before that event was scheduled to begin, BLM sent a text message directing demonstrators to board Blue Line light-rail trains. People at the mall ushered participants toward the trains and handed out prepaid fare tickets, according to a bystander at the mall. When the trains arrived at the Humphrey Terminal station, protesters pushed their way past police officers and airport security guards to gain entry to the Humphrey Terminal. Confused travelers looked on as the group marched through the terminal chanting slogans such as "No justice, no peace! Prosecute the police!” "The mall was a decoy,” Black Lives Matter organizer Miski Noor, who protested at the airport, told the Associated Press. "I think it was really effective.” Black Lives Matter called for Wednesday's demonstration to protest the Nov. 15 fatal shooting of Jamar Clark, 24, by Minneapolis police officers. Protest leaders are demanding that investigators release video recordings of the incident, that a special prosecutor be assigned to the case and that four men accused of shooting protesters after Clark's death face federal domestic terrorism charges. Gov. Mark Dayton said the moving protest created a "very, very dangerous situation.” Dayton questioned the need for such a demonstration, noting that federal and state investigations into Clark's death were ongoing. The governor said releasing video could jeopardize the investigations. Art Seratoff, a 67-year-old protester from Minneapolis, dismissed the criticism. "They talk about this demonstration as being disruptive,” Seratoff told the AP. "If I think about an unemployment rate in the African-American community three times the white unemployment rate, that's disruptive.” The Mall of America sought a court injunction blocking the protest after a rally last Christmas drew hundreds of demonstrators to the East Rotunda. A Hennepin County judge ruled that three protest organizers named in the request could be barred from demonstrating but otherwise rejected the mall's request. On Wednesday as the protest hour approached, mall security deployed bag-check stations and displayed a video warning that the demonstration was not authorized. "All participants must leave Mall of America property immediately,” the message said. "Those who fail to leave the property immediately will be subject to arrest.” Several shoppers expressed disappointment that their plans were disrupted by the protesters. Stores around the rotunda began closing shortly before 1 p.m. and officers in riot gear lined up in the entrances. About 80 stores were closed for an hour while officers escorted protesters off mall property, according to the Mall of America. "We respect the rights of free speech and peaceful assembly,” the Mall of America said in a statement Wednesday afternoon. "However, the courts have affirmed our right as private property owners to prohibit demonstrations on our property.” Protesters who didn't stay at the mall arrived at the nearby airport about 1:55 p.m. Airport security was on alert for spillover from the mall but was not prepared for trainloads of protesters. When protesters arrived on the Blue Line, the few officers stationed at the doors leading up to the terminal were unable to keep the group from pushing its way inside. The group traced a circuitous route around the terminal, forcing the closure of the security checkpoints and preventing travelers from boarding their planes. Protesters eventually ended up back at the light-rail platform about 2:45 p.m. Airport police assisted by state troopers and officers from neighboring communities assembled on the platform in riot gear, cutting off the protesters' route back into the airport. Hogan said Terminal 2 carriers Sun Country and Southwest delayed their flights so most of those travelers were able to board after the security checkpoints reopened. Warned by officers that they risked arrest if they stayed, most of the protesters boarded a Blue Line train shortly after 3 p.m. Other protesters blocked roadways leading to the airport, backing up traffic and causing some Terminal 1 travelers to miss their flights. Police said a total of 15 people were arrested, some at the mall and some at the airport, mostly for trespassing or obstruction of justice, but that no injuries or property damage were reported. Mike Griffin, who joined similar protests last year, said his flight to Chicago was among those delayed. "While I'm delayed an hour and a half to get back to my family for Christmas, I know there are several black families mourning the loss of innocent black men,” Griffin, a 29-year-old from Minneapolis, told the AP. "My mom is a little bit annoyed, but she's going to see me this holiday season.” Nick Woltman can be reached at 651-228-5189. Follow him at twitter.com/nickwoltman.
