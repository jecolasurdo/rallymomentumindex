Residents took part in a rally against racism on Friday (June 5) where up to 150 people took to the streets in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. Policing superintendent for Redditch, Mark Colquhoun, said: "We know people want to make their voices heard. The right to lawful protest is a key part of any democracy, which West Mercia Police continues to uphold and facilitate. "The protest in Redditch on Friday was peaceful, for which we are grateful, but we must emphasise that, due to current restrictions aimed at preventing the further spread of Covid-19, gatherings outside of more than six people is unlawful, and we ask people to find alternative and legal methods to have their say and voice their concerns. "We continue to engage with our communities and want to ensure Worcestershire is a safe place to live and work.” The protest was organised by 18-year-old Storm Tatlow of Callow Hill. She told the Advertiser: "It went really well – there was a massive turnout. "We went on a peaceful march through the town. There were people sharing their own stories. It was very inspirational. She added: "The movement is something I feel very strongly about. I feel like most of my generation feels the same way about the issue." People who joined the protest chanted the name of US citizen George Floyd and the phrase 'we can't breathe' as they marched through the town centre. Anti-racism protests have been carried out across the UK in wake of the death of George Floyd, although Government ministers have urged people to avoid mass gatherings. Mr Floyd died after a white police officer held him down by pressing his knee into his neck in Minneapolis on May 25. 11 comments Sorry, an error occurred.
