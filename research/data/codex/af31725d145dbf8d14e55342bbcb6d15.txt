It will work backwards from Ward 4, to Wards 3, 2 and 1 in that order. The collection is for storm damage brush only, which must be stacked neatly at the curb. Smaller limbs meeting WCA's yard waste collection guidelines (here) can be placed curbside on Mondays. Below is information about storm damage brush collection: Collection begins at 7 a.m. Brush should be placed parallel to the curb in order to not block the sidewalk or stick into the street. Branches must be eight feet in length or shorter. Longer branches will not fit in Public Works trucks. Residents must cut and stack limbs from right-of-way trees. Public Works will start with smaller piles, and larger piles may require contractor assistance. Public Works will pick up the majority of the brush, but small debris remaining will be the homeowner's responsibility. Additional information about the storm damage brush collection in Fairway can be found here.
