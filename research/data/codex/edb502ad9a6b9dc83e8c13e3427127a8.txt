(Image via YouTube)OAK PARK, IL — Oak Park and River Forest High School students staged a sit-in Monday after two staff members said they were placed on administrative leave. The sit-in participants said the staff members were suspended for supporting student protests. More than 100 students gathered inside the school for the sit-in and at least a dozen community members and parents stood outside the school in solidarity. The protesters said teacher Anthony Clark and aid Shoneize Teynolds were placed on administrative leave for helping to organize a student march and sit-in. In an email to parents and families, OPRF Superintendent Joylynn Pruitt-Adams said the staff members have not been accused of wrongdoing. She said there have been no suspensions, and that the staff members were placed on a routine leave of absence while an investigation is conducted. Subscribe No further details were released due to the issue being a "personnel matter," the school board said. This week's sit-in followed a student walkout that was held on Feb. 26 on the anniversary of Trayvon Martin's death. In a letter to parents, the school board said that staff and faculty weren't allowed to participate in the walkout; however, Clark did take part.Subscribe While walking with the students, Clark provided "support and advice very much in the role of a teacher," and played "a crucial role in deescalating the situation," according to a Facebook post by the Suburban Unity Alliance. The school board has not confirmed whether Clark's leave of absence is in connection with the Feb. 26 walkout. Following the controversy, a school board Town Hall on Racial Equity and School Safety will be held from 6:30 to 9 p.m. Thursday, March 7, at the OPRF South cafeteria, the school board said.
