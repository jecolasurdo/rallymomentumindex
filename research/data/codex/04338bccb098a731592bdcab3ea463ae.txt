Those who participated maintained social distance, wore masks and were encouraged to share photos as an expression of support online with #WhiteCoats ForBlackLives.Floyd, who attended school at South Florida Community (State) College, died while in police custody on May 25 in Minneapolis after a police officer knelt on the handcuffed man's neck for nearly nine minutes.
