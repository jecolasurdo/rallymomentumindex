This, as a large crowd of supporters gathered nearly 24 hours after the grand jury decision was handed down in Ferguson. Photo Gallery View Gallery (42 images) Inline Inline Inline Inline Inline Inline Inline Inline Inline Inline Inline Inline Inline It began Tuesday evening inside downtown Milwaukee's Red Arrow Park. Supporters, and members of Dontre Hamilton gathered for what was billed as a peaceful protest in solidarity with Ferguson, Missouri. In Ferguson on Monday, it was announced a grand jury has decided there is no probable cause to indict Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson in the August shooting of Michael Brown. That decision led to outrage and protests in Ferguson and across the country -- including here in Milwaukee. Dontre Hamilton and Michael Brown The case out of Ferguson is similar to the case here in Milwaukee involving Dontre Hamilton. 31-year-old Hamilton was shot and killed in April by Milwaukee police officer Christopher Manney. Manney has been terminated from the Milwaukee Police Department over his handling of Hamilton that day -- a termination he's appealing. Meanwhile, Dontre Hamilton's family continues to await a decision out of the Milwaukee County District Attorney's Office as to whether Christopher Manney will face criminal charges in the shooting. It's a decision they have waited to hear for nearly seven months. Dontre Hamilton's mother, Maria and brother, Nate watched the grand jury decision out of Ferguson be read on Monday evening. It was a decision that upset Maria Hamilton so much, she had to leave the room. One day later, Hamilton's family members and a large crowd of more than 100 supporters met in Red Arrow Park at 5:00 p.m. Tuesday, November 25th. They've been demonstrating in downtown Milwaukee since the shooting. After gathering in Red Arrow Park, the crowd marched down Water Street -- at times blocking traffic and chanting "whose streets? Our streets" -- and chanting Dontre Hamilton's name. "I can't deny that my family is hurt. I can't deny that the people of this community are hurt. We're trying to stay peaceful." "I can't deny that my family is hurt. I can't deny that the people of this community are hurt. We're trying to stay peaceful. We're trying to make the right steps on getting change done because that's what we want -- we want change done. We understand that through violence it kind of overshadows the change that needs to be made. It's just been too long for justice not to arrive in the city of Milwaukee," Dontre Hamilton's brother, Nate Hamilton said Tuesday. The group marched to the Federal Courthouse. They then entered the Grand Avenue Mall -- and made their way through the mall. Store employees locked their doors as demonstrators chanted. The group eventually exited the mall, and headed back onto the streets. Just after 6:30 p.m., Ashley Sears reported the group was headed to the Milwaukee Bucks game at the BMO Harris Bradley Center. As the game neared tip-off, protesters attempted to push their way inside. That had Milwaukee police tweeting out this message on Twitter: Demonstrators notified that they are subject to arrest, at the request of property owners, if they go on private property #ProtestInPeace — Milwaukee Police (@MilwaukeePolice) November 26, 2014 The group eventually made its way back to Red Arrow Park before 7:30 p.m. Milwaukee police said on Twitter just after 7:30 they received a report of an individual with a weapon at Red Arrow Park. Police detained a man, and an investigation ensued. That man was eventually released. Officers respond to a report of a man with a weapon at Red Arrow park. Individual has been detained while we investigate. #ProtestInPeace — Milwaukee Police (@MilwaukeePolice) November 26, 2014 Individual MPD detained after report of a weapon has been released after officers determined he had a "Leatherman Tool" #ProtestInPeace — Milwaukee Police (@MilwaukeePolice) November 26, 2014 Milwaukee police issued this statement to FOX6 News on Tuesday evening's protest: "The Milwaukee Police Department again successfully policed demonstrations in the downtown area. As we have in the past, we protected life, First Amendment rights, and property. The Hamilton family again reiterated their desire for peaceful demonstrations and expressions of frustration, and the MPD again demonstrated restraint in its facilitation of the demonstration. No arrests were made. Because a few people were intent on ignoring the family's request for an orderly protest, a Milwaukee police sergeant and officer were injured protecting the BMO Harris Bradley Center from protesters attempting to unlawfully enter the building. The members have not sought medical attention at this time. This investigation is ongoing and we are actively seeking the assailants. Anyone with information is asked to call Milwaukee police."

I'm not sure of the 'struggle' the African American community feels they have, but there has to be something that isn't right, because they are obviously upset and i believe ( not sure ) that this goes deeper than Michael Brown?? November 25, 2014 at 6:44 pm John sizzle Maybe they don't feel their getting enough free handouts? November 25, 2014 at 11:46 pm Duh They're December 19, 2014 at 6:05 pm John sizzle When will white people who had nothing to do with slavery and black people who never were slaves end this victimization mentality? It's been 150 years. 300 years 400 years? When will excuses for constant irresponsibility in the black community end? November 25, 2014 at 11:49 pm Anonymous The civil rights movement happened a little over 50 years ago. Did all that racism just magically disappear? November 26, 2014 at 12:12 pm Lone ranger Why is so hard for people to understand? If you cooperate with police don't attempt to bash an officer in the head with a club punch him in the face or try to remove his firearm bad things won't happen to you. It is so simple!! Both these cases involved the criminal attacking the officer with the attention of doing great bodily harm. The same rules apply to all races of people no white officer goes to work hoping to use deadly force against someone. The police are there to provide law and order a society without would self destruct. November 25, 2014 at 7:44 pm John sizzle Doesn't matter when we know the offenders intention. Cop didn't start shooting those thugs until they were attacked. More excuses for irresponsibility. What do you think another 150 years of victimization mentality before black thugs (not all) can get over themselves and join civilized society November 25, 2014 at 11:52 pm Bill Here comes soulbigdaddy with his race card/hatred towards the police again! I missed ya buddy! November 26, 2014 at 12:31 am JC Obviously there needs to be more arrests. November 25, 2014 at 9:41 pm Maria This group just completely lost my respect. I was in suppirt of their passion and pursuit of justice...but I think that they are now going too far. Its becoming less like a peaceful demonstration and more like a kid throwing a tantrum. Theyre going to end up getting someone hurt. Look...already a call about someone with a gun. Whats next...forcing a situation like the one they are already protesting? Ridiculous. Shameful. November 25, 2014 at 10:00 pm Lori And where was Dontre Hamilton's family when he was wandering Milwaukee and sleeping in Red Arrow Park?! Now that he is dead it is everbody else's fault??? Man up family, this is YOUR fault! November 25, 2014 at 10:21 pm Melissa His family had a restraining order out on him! They wanted nothing to do with him until it could potentially benefit them publically and financially. November 26, 2014 at 6:43 am Sara Banks Its all about the cash. Disgusting parasite lawyers and a welfare parasite family trying to cash in. So they foment hatred in a mob who wants nothing more then to smash and loot free stuff. If we had a Mayor and police chief with any sort of common sense they would reign in this stuff in hard or Milwaukee could go up in smoke like so many other communities with weak leaders. It is sad but I am leaving this city which is falling apart. 5 generations of my family have lived here and now I am leaving because we have an out of control city that is heading down the path of Detroit. Unless the leaders prove me wrong that Milwaukee can be a safe place to live...I'm outta here!!! November 26, 2014 at 9:37 am Anonymous Have you ever dealt with an adult family member suffering from mental illness? If they do not or cannot receive help, there is nothing you can do for them. And then to have them in your home, affecting everyone involved including children, you might have to make the heart-breaking decision to let them go. I have a freind dealing with this now with her husband and her hands are tied! November 26, 2014 at 12:03 pm Danielle How are you sure they are not tax payers? November 25, 2014 at 10:25 pm John sizzle Because tax payers don't have time to protest for martyred criminals who put themselves where they ended up. November 25, 2014 at 11:45 pm Melissa Taxpayers are busy working and then wanting to go home to their law-abiding families, not protesting. November 26, 2014 at 6:39 am Tim Tha Cheeze Krygiel blacks already murder whites, what your saying is kinda false November 25, 2014 at 10:54 pm ELS I'm so glad I moved out of the city, you can have it! November 25, 2014 at 10:59 pm Reality Ok Danielle...Maybe it's blacks that don't understand? How many blacks have been murdered by blacks? You should march about that. If you want to be outraged about someone it should be Derek Williams, or the long response times by 911 to certain neighborhoods. Dontre Hamilton went after a cop I.m pretty sure Black people. Hispanic people, Asian people and yes, even white people know they will get popped if they do that. I agree there are still challenges facing people of color everyday, situations like you explained the nurse going through, that should be addressed I agree, but if you go after a cop it doesn't matter who or what you are at that point you should expect to be shot. Have you checked out Dillon Taylor's story in Utah? November 25, 2014 at 11:18 pm John sizzle Shocking that like in Ferguson blacks in Milwaukee feel victimized by police who have to continuously deal with high levels of criminal activity in their neighborhoods. Hamilton beat a cop with his own baton and was shot by an officer protecting his own life. How dare a cop in Milwaukee like Ferguson use deadly force when confronted by criminals attacking them and assaulting them. Where is the outrage for all the black on black crime? How about outrage for the mothers rolling on top of and suffocating their babies? Why are the criminals martyred when they act like thugs and criminals and are shot for attacking cops? Enough BS. I'm sick of paying for these freeloading excuse making jerks. Get jobs, be responsible people, and get a clue. Stop the constant victimization mentality and learn how to wear your pants without your underwear showing. November 25, 2014 at 11:43 pm James @john sizzle 400 years of being molested physically, mentally, emotionally as a entire race does not just go away in only 150 years. As a black successful business owner and a person who has never been arrested I will always feel victimized because of the color of my skin as long as white people in this day and age forever keep recievieving the "privelege” or "passage way” or "benefits” of being white that are denied to us black folks today in this day .150 years later. To help you understand, think about a kid who gets kidnapped, beaten, raped, all their lives, will that child ever really be emotionally right and and free and clear of any mental scars. The answer is no. That same abuse happened to the entire black race for over 400 years at the hands of white folks. Laws have changed but the over all abusive mentality is still there. Not making excuses. Just stating facts. November 26, 2014 at 2:00 am 2ECOND so where is your anger towards your OWN race for being slave owners even up to present? so sick of hearing the whining about black oppression. its all just a lame excuse to attempt to get more free handouts. November 26, 2014 at 4:00 am Anonymous Were the African slave owners here in America? Did they say blacks were 3/5ths a person and deny them the right to vote and have other freedoms denied them that were granted to the majority? Did they create laws that didn't allow blacks to use restrooms or go to certain schools just a little over 50 years ago and an unjust criminal system that is biased against them? I must have missed that in history class. November 26, 2014 at 12:08 pm diane James if you haven't been exposed and beaten raped in your lifetime... you need to get on with it...what about the jews..do they use their persecution as an excuse...blacks from these days aren't slave to any man..they are slaves to the entitlement mentality (for the most part).. and the government entitlement programs which keep them in a state of poverty self respect and self responsiblity is lacking" the blame game is big and the what can i get for free attitude is rampant.. look on y tube for videos of african american in particular a young woman who is proud of her four children at the age of 40 who has never worked gets $780 in food stamps, an ebt card, wic, a place to live and a free phone and has no desire to work.. really i say really..she doesn't look like she is hurting and I don't believe she is an exception either... good for you you have your own business..you pay taxes..I can't go to Milwaukee and feel safe..I would be a target blonde and a woman... I would be discriminated against and I wouldn't be safe!!! so I have fears just like you...if you are a minority there are a heck of alot more government programs and give aways hiring quotas for employers based if you are a certain skin color rather than your actual qualifications..that is reverse discrimination and it happens to white people everyday..so don't play the race card ok..that is a old lame excuse..morals, goodness, work ethic and just plain being a "good” person.. I didn't see many good people in the riot videos and really parents took their kids on a "field trip” to burn loot steal and create mahem that sure is good isnt it November 26, 2014 at 3:16 am James Diane. Just to educate you. There are more white people on government assistance then there are black people. Just to bust your little blonde bubble. Not whinnying either. Like I said I own my own business have been in business for years never received government hand outs. Generally successful in my industry I had to work harder than any white person I know to become who I am. I'm proud of that. I love being black it's great. Living in the suburbs myself and being black I know what it is to be discriminated against. You being white and”blonde” don't have a clue. Tried to share some knowledge on you white folks commenting on this subject but all it seems like I'm responding to is a bunch of ignorant bigots(ask yourselfs,”how many black friends do you have??”) I'm done enjoy your holiday 😛 November 26, 2014 at 9:18 am soulobigdaddy Well said James!! November 29, 2014 at 7:55 am Milwaukee microphone You guys will rot in hell for your evil little minds, the Lord will have mercy on the misinformed ones November 26, 2014 at 3:28 am ACHILEUS ASTRALUPITHICUS AFRIKANUS The blacks need to quit being "black” and start being Americans. November 26, 2014 at 6:07 am Melissa CHECK OUT "NICE GUY” DONTRE HAMILTON'S ARREST RECORD, AND THEN TELL ME THIS IS A TRAGIC MISTAKE! http://wcca.wicourts.gov/pager.do;jsessionid=6950FF3CED85524B47B34AD008D2907B.render6?cacheId=AA19E414E84518EA9367130ACC30FDF5&offset=0&sortColumn=0&sortDirection=DESC November 26, 2014 at 6:45 am liberalmkejudge Chief Flynn said it best, we are tired of you race baiters https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncRGoqNUb1w November 26, 2014 at 7:49 am Do you people have a job? It is time these hoodlums get arrested for tying up traffic and creating a nuisance. Your son assaulted a Cop and "Yes” he deserved to get shot and killed. I don't know why the Mayor and Chief bend over for you people. Take responsibility for his actions. Protest the 102 year old black woman raped by one of your people last week. At to the white people protesting with you....These black people hate you! Suckers! November 26, 2014 at 8:02 am Mya Honestly I think that the people in Ferguson and all over the US should not be looting and destroying stores because its truly not going to do anything but bring down the community and city. Meaning you can protest in peace and still try and make a change but now that your running through stores stealing, burning buildings down and causing ruckus all over your city is ridiculus. November 26, 2014 at 8:20 am chris Hey Hamilton family. Nobody cares about your dead son just as you didnt care about him when he was alive. All you see is dollar signs and will disrupt and cause as many headaches to the population of Milwaukee as you possibly can until they pay you to go away. November 26, 2014 at 9:16 am get real The real victim is Officer Christopher Manney who was doing his job as he was trained to do. He was the person who was attacked and then was in a fight for his life. Officer Manney then had to suffer the indignity of being used as public punching bag when Mayor Barrett, Chief Flynn and District Attorney John Chisholm did not have the courage to do the right thing. My heart goes out to Officer Manney and his family. November 26, 2014 at 10:35 am Biddy People are NOT aware that Chris Manney was FOURTH officer to deal with Dontre Hamilton THAT DAY. Someone had called the police department TWICE to "report” on Dontre Hamilton in the park. The first two sets of officers talked to him, found him doing nothing wrong, so left him where he was. By the time Chris Manney showed up, he had been confronted TWICE by police, so is it any wonder there was trouble?? They should find out WHO made those phone calls!! Because the one WHO made the CALLS is at least PARTLY RESPONSIBLE for what happened. Chris Manney? Are you kidding?? He walked right a bad situation. He was the REGULAR BEAT COP and used to asking drunks to "move on” and used to checking up on calls from Starbucks whenever a patron or employee thought someone might be using drugs in the public restrooms or when someone thought a drug deal might be going down. So to him, Dontre Hamilton was just one of those he dealt with every day. I doubt he was even aware he had already been checked out TWICE, and even if he was, he was just doing his job. Dontre Hamilton according to a Starbucks employee grabbed Manney's baton and Manney supposedly got hit with it, more than once. What I understand, from the eye witness report of a barista, and others who saw some of what happened, is that Dontre Hamilton, probably assuming his trouble was over with the cops, got enraged at a THIRD cop visit and grabbed Manney's baton and proceeded to hit him with it. Manney shot at him multiple times and now a man is dead. Let me also tell you that police officers ARE INSTRUCTED when they shoot someone to EMPTY ALL THEIR ROUNDS OUT OF THEIR GUN to prevent a criminal from grabbing the weapon and using on them or someone else. So the questions we have to ask have nothing to do with racial profiling, or what Chris Manney's "motive” was, what we have to ask is: was it necessary to shoot the rounds all into Dontre? Was he able to shoot elsewhere so as not to hit him with all the rounds? What about the previous calls? WHO MADE THEM? Did Manney know ANYTHING about what had transpired earlier, because if he did, then maybe we could accuse him of something, but if he DIDN'T, then it is NOT HIS FAULT, it is the police department's lack of communication and the person who did the prior complaints about Dontre sleeping in the park. Dontre still holds a little fault of his own. He COULD have submitted to another pat down, or better yet, just left the park after the first two cop visits, figuring more trouble could be coming. The department COULD have told Manney just to leave him alone or there "could be trouble”. That would have been the wisest action of them all. If there was a THIRD CALL, however, then we KNOW who was really to blame, the person or persons who thought someone sleeping in the park was illegal. Actually, it's not. The police department should have left the matter alone and informed the third caller, if there was a third call, that Dontre had already been frisked twice and found to be posing no danger.
