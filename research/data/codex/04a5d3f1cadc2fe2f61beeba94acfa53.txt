They weren't always wearing masks during the stay at home protests and apparently that was a policy to CHP was trying where they thought it would be less intimidating if they just walked their way through the crowd. Eventually, those protests got so large. That the CHP has sealed off the Capitol grounds. No one 's permitted to have a protest on the Capitol grounds Right now. the CHP bike patrol up there. Those guys can zip to the scene of any issues that arise, but everybody here is saying they just want a nice peaceful demonstration. I'm gonna walk around the backside of it.
