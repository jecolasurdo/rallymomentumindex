Print City Heights — Family members of people killed by law officers in San Diego County turned out for a rally and march in City Heights Saturday as part of a national day of protest against police brutality.Similar protests were to be staged across the nation, from Washington, D.C., New York and South Carolina through Ohio and Iowa, Texas, and across California.Nearly 150 supporters took part in the local protest, along with members of various organizations, including United Against Police Terror. Police said no one was arrested.They gathered about 6 p.m. at Officer Jeremy Henwood Memorial Park off Fairmount Avenue and Wightman Street. Advertisement The protest opened with Native American drummers and dancers from by Grupo Danza Azteca Quetzalhuitzilin, followed by brief speeches from families of those killed by officers. Victoria Jones said she did not trust the police investigation into the death of her son, Lamontez Jones. He was shot and killed by San Diego police in October 2015 when he brandished a fake handgun during an encounter with two officers downtown."The painting they used, I'm here to tell you, it wasn't the complete picture,” Jones told the crowd.Scores of protests, some violent, have been staged after police killings across the nation, especially after unarmed black men were shot. Advertisement Locally, an El Cajon police officer shot and killed 38-year-old Alfred Olango on Sept. 27. He pulled a vaping device out of his pocket and aimed it at the officer from a short distance away.Olango's sister, who watched the fatal encounter, had called police because he wasn't acting normally. His mother later said Olango was highly distraught over the recent death of his best friend."Alfred Olango was just one victim. ... Many more families have been affected,” said Catherine Mendonça, the event's organizer with United Against Police Terror.Some of those families shared their experiences with the crowd Saturday. Advertisement Jenny Badua's nephew, Simon Hubble, was fatally shot by sheriff's deputy after he left a treatment program, showed up suicidal at his parents' Alpine home and armed himself with a screwdriver in May 2015."A social worker called the sheriffs because he was suicidal,” Badua said. "They came out and killed him.”Maria Hoyt of San Diego said her nephew, Sergio Weick, was killed by sheriff's deputies in Vista in August after a pursuit and foot chase. Hoyt said the official versions of the event were inconsistent.Some speakers became more fiery, using profanities to express anger at police. About half the crowd began a march about 8:15 p.m., circling the block, chanting, waving signs, and shouting at officers. Advertisement Law enforcement was out in force, with about 50 San Diego police cars and motorcycles parked nearby before the rally. Another two dozen California Highway Patrol vehicles staged near the Interstate 15 overpass at University Avenue, where marchers had expressed intentions to demonstrate.The marchers returned to the park about 8:30 p.m. and dispersed within an hour.On its website, an organization called The October 22 Coalition to Stop Police Brutality, Repression and the Criminalization of a Generation says it has mobilized a national day of protest every year since 1996. The site states that it is "bringing together those under the gun and those not under the gun as a powerful voice to expose the epidemic of police brutality.”Research by the San Diego Union-Tribune tallied 383 fatal officer-involved shootings in San Diego County since 1980. No government entity has tracked every fatal law enforcement encounter.
