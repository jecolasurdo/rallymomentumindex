Black Lives Matter Protest Moves through Peoria News by: Shane Gustafson Posted: Jul 10, 2016 / 07:42 PM CDT / Updated: Jul 10, 2016 / 10:18 PM CDT A black lives matter protest made its way through the streets of Peoria Sunday afternoon. Liberty park along Peoria's riverfront was a gathering place for change. "It's not just about black lives matter, I think all lives matter, black, white, it doesn't matter,” said supporter, Zachery Watkins. Close 100 people, equipped with signs and the message of love say they were using their voices to stop the deadly violence, especially with and against police officers. "Violence shouldn't be toward anybody, police officers or citizens , I think both sides should respect each other,” Watkins said. "We have to do something, because if you do nothing than it will continue as it is,” said LaFelda Jones with Black Lives Matter. "I think having conversations about what other people go through will open our eyes to their struggles, especially the struggles of black lives,” said Marcus Fogliano with Peoria Intersections. Peoria intersections sponsored event Sunday but they say they're also pioneering the black lives matter movement in Peoria. Their message isn't about one life being more important than another. "It's not to say that black lives matter over blue lives, because all lives matter, but all people need to be held accountable no matter who we are,” Jones said. It's a message that resonated even stronger in a march that followed, flooding parts of Water Street. The Black Lives Matter march ended at the Peoria Police Headquarters, with police chief Jerry Mitchell listening to concerns from the marchers, who came all the way from Liberty Park.” "We have an amazing police department here in the city of Peoria, but even within our department, there are people, that due to police unions, are still there,” Fogliano said. Mitchell answered some of the heated questions. A relief to many, who say their issue isn't with local police, but instead being treated fairly. "What they are saying is we all want to come together and we as black people, we want to be treated as you as any other person wants to be treated,” Jones said.
