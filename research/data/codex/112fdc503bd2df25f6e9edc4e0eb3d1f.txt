Police say protesters shut down the southbound lanes starting at 125th Street just before 10 a.m. From there- they marched down to about 106th Street. At least seven people were arrested. All lanes have since reopened. The protest, led by Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, members of Black Lives Matter and other advocates, is part of a campaign called "11 Days of Rage," which is symbolic of the 11 times Garner screamed "I can't breathe" during video of his deadly arrest. They are protesting the Justice Department's decision not to prosecute Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who placed Garner in a chokehold five years ago.
