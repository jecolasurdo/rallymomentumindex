Here are the players who protested in Week 13:Seattle Seahawks: Seahawks players linked arms during the anthem before Sunday night's game against the Panthers, just as they've done for every regular-season game this season. -- Sheil KapadiaSan Diego Chargers: Before Sunday's game against the Bucs, offensive linemen Joe Barksdale, D.J. Fluker and Chris Hairston once again raised their fists during the national anthem. -- Eric D. WilliamsSan Francisco 49ers: Quarterback Colin Kaepernick and outside linebacker Eli Harold again knelt during the national anthem before the 49ers' game against the Bears. No other 49ers participated in any form of protest. -- Nick WagonerPhiladelphia Eagles: Safety Malcolm Jenkins raised a fist over his head during the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Bengals. He has been protesting since Week 2 against the Chicago Bears. Cornerback Ron Brooks typically protests with him but has not been present on the sideline the past six games, after undergoing surgery to repair a ruptured quad tendon. Jenkins recently discussed at length his reasons for protesting. -- Tim McManusMiami Dolphins: Wide receiver Kenny Stills and safety Michael Thomas knelt for the anthem before the Dolphins' game against the Ravens. They've done so for every game this season. -- James WalkerLos Angeles Rams: Defensive end Robert Quinn raised his right fist during the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Patriots, as has been his custom since the start of the regular season. Quinn said he will continue to do so regardless of whatever backlash he receives on social media. Said Quinn: "People have the right to voice their opinion. It's up to you whether you listen to it or not. If people feel bad or feel upset about making a stand, that's their personal opinion and judgment. At the end of the day, I'm just standing up for what I believe is right." -- Alden Gonzalez FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmail
