A larger march between city hall and Westland Police Department headquarters had been planned, and a protest spokeswoman said "we still have the march in our pocket" if activists aren't satisfied with police reforms."The culture in Westland has to change," said Crystal Linton of the Inkster/Western Wayne County chapter of the National Action Network."Things need to start from the top down," said Will Miller, the chapter president.Activists said Police Chief Jeff Jedrusik phoned Miller on Wednesday and that the two plan to meet soon. "He has reached out. We are trying to work with them," Miller said.Calls to the chief's office were not returned Friday afternoon.More: Homeowner confronts stranger in his house; suspect arrestedMore: 26 Westland restaurants cited for August health violationsThe protest came days after charges were announced against a police sergeant and two former paramedics in the case of William Marshall, a 35-year-old black man who was in police custody when he died of cocaine toxicity Dec. 10.

"I feel safer in Wayne County knowing that she's the prosecutor," she said.Activists on Friday said they want to see officers wearing body cameras — the department purchased cameras last summer and is in the process of deploying them — as well as retraining and disciplinary actions against police over the Taser incidents.Raymurez Brown, 33, was Tasered outside his home on the night of Aug. 17 after an argument with officers, who were there investigating a report of assault and vandalism, escalated. Brown was arrested on several charges; much of the incident was captured on a video that was seen thousands of times.Brown said Friday that he was awaiting the results of a test to determine the extent of a knee injury suffered during the arrest. He may have to undergo surgery, he said.Brown was holding his two-month-old son, Chris, as police began Tasering him, and an officer was suspended for 30 days following the incident, with Jedrusik calling the use of the Taser "questionable." Police say the boy was not hurt but Brown and his supporters say they aren't certain of that.Brown said he wants to hear more specifics about what mistakes police made. "They're always so forthcoming on what we've done wrong," he said.Shingles, 29, was Tasered in the doorway of his house about 2 a.m. on June 22. Police had come to the house looking for his father, who was said to have been involved in a nearby crime, and arrested Shingles on outstanding warrants.Shingles says he was polite and cooperative with police. Though he admits to having had outstanding traffic warrants, he suggests his arrest was in retaliation for his refusal to let officers search his house without a search warrant.Jedrusik, however, has defended police actions in the Shingles case.Shingles said he was grateful for protesters' show of support for himself and Brown."All lives matter," he said. "That's what I want to see in the world today."Contact Matt Jachman at mjachman@hometownlife.com.
