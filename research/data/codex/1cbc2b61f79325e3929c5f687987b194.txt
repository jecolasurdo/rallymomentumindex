Ahead of the silent protest, organiser Ellie Ruewell said to those planning to attend: "We will be lining the closed Madeira Drive road along the seafront to show solidarity to all BIPOC (black, indigenous, people of colour) communities who continuously and tirelessly have their human rights challenged and fear dangerous oppression from authorities and governments alike. "I need to again stress this is a peaceful, silent protest where we stand in solidarity.” Advertising It was the second weekend in a row that a protest supporting the Black Lives Matter movement had been held in Brighton (Andrew Matthews/PA) Protesters held signs calling out racism and prejudice, with one saying: "If you had time to watch Tiger King, you had time to learn.” Another echoed the phrase chanted across the world: "No justice. No peace.” The demonstration was watched over by Sussex Police, with officers on foot and motorcycle seen at the edges of the crowd. Many of the protesters were later expected to join a separate event, marching through the streets of the East Sussex city.
