Tension built throughout the night as protesters and police clashed in the heart of the city. Video shared on social media showed a driver striking a demonstrator in the street near the Capitol, footage that Gov. Jared Polis later said left him "absolutely shocked.” The crowds grew larger as the night progressed, and, at around 9:15 p.m., Denver police fired tear gas and pepper spray to disperse hundreds who remained on the Capitol lawn. People ran in all directions through Capitol Hill and Civic Center to escape the fumes. By 11 p.m., Denver police reported that all downtown streets had reopened, except for 13th and Lincoln streets, where officers were "monitoring smaller groups of protesters.” But protesters threw fireworks at cops, prompting another round of tear gas around 12:30 a.m. The crowd then sprinted down Broadway to 12th Street where police again gained control. The crowd dwindled and the streets were getting quiet around 1:30 a.m. The demonstrators had gathered at the state Capitol to call for justice on behalf of Floyd, a Minneapolis man who died Monday as officers pinned him to the ground — including one who kept his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes. Protests have rocked Minneapolis for three nights, and have spread to other cities across the U.S. The state legislature's Democratic leadership announced before midnight that neither the Senate nor the House of Representatives would meet for scheduled sessions on Friday or Saturday, the state Capitol shut down by protests just three days after legislators returned from a 2 1/2-month coronavirus-imposed break. House Majority Leader Alec Garnett said the shutdown of the legislature is intended to "allow space for protests that we expect to continue on Friday and into the weekend.” In Denver just after 11 p.m., police stood on the corners of Colfax Avenue and Broadway, where a large group of demonstrators chanted "I can't breathe! I can't breathe!” One officer was seen using a spray bottle to deploy gas at a protester who got near the police. Officers also fired gas and pepper balls toward the group. Gas filled the westernmost section of Civic Center Park as police tried to push people out of the area. Just after midnight, a crowd of about 150 people remained at 12th Street and Broadway, chanting and yelling at Denver police officers. Hyoung Chang, The Denver PostProtestors face off with Denver Police officers outside the Colorado Capitol in Denver on Thursday evening, May 28, 2020. Demonstrators marched across downtown Denver demanding justice for George Floyd, a man who died at the hands of Minneapolis police officers. Tyler Stevens, of Denver, said he was at the Capitol when shots were fired about 30 minutes into the protest. Police escorted people into the building for protection. "We stand with Minneapolis, like my sign says,” Stevens said. "If nothing's going to change, there are people around the whole country who are going to stand up.” A few protesters were arrested, but Kurt Barnes, a Denver police spokesman, said he did not know an exact number or what they were arrested for. Graffiti was painted on the building's steps, doors and walls. Windows of a police car and a state senator's truck were smashed. Officers confirmed six or seven shots were fired about 5:35 p.m. toward the Capitol, Barnes said. There were no known injuries. He said the initial 911 caller was standing at the intersection of 15th Street and West Colfax Avenue. It was not immediately clear from where exactly the shots were fired, Barnes said. Police did not have anybody in custody or know the motive of the shooter, Barnes said. "We do believe that the shots were toward the Capitol, but we do not at this point have any correlation to the protest or the protesters,” Barnes said. About the time shots were fired, the protesters had started marching, winding down Colfax Avenue to the 16th Street Mall and into LoDo. Police briefly held protesters in place at Coors Field. However, when people began to move, the march splintered into different groups. Just before 7 p.m. a few dozen marched onto I-25, where they blocked traffic in both directions. Police fired pepper spray to get them to move, and footage from a television helicopter showed people running. RELATED: Public officials respond to George Floyd protests in Denver Gwen Kubik, a Capitol Hill resident who joined the protest, said they saw a man get hit "square in the head” with tear gas. Kubik also felt the sting. "It started as a dry cough, and then it starts to get in your eyes, like if you ever touched your eyes with a hot pepper,” Kubick said. "That was my first time experiencing tear gas personally, but I know to bring milk from some organizations I'm part of online.” At the Capitol, protesters surrounded a police car, and officers used nonlethal weapons to move people. One witness tweeted a video of a car running over at least three protesters on Lincoln Street before speeding away. The pedestrians did not appear to be seriously injured. Denver police closed Broadway and Lincoln Street around the Capitol and I-25 in the area of 15th Street because of the demonstrations. State Rep. Leslie Herod, D-Denver, was watching the protesters when she heard the gunshots. Hyoung Chang, The Denver PostJovan Brock, center, holds a sign during the protest. "State Patrol is on scene. They told us all to get down and run. They worked to clear the scene,” Herod said. "They (the shots) came from down by the RTD bus stop, up toward the Capitol. I did not see who shot; I was not looking at that. It was multiple shots. "They shot into a crowd of people protesting police brutality. It's an act of violence against our community.” State Rep. Jonathan Singer, D-Longmont, said he was with Herod watching the protest on the west side of the Capitol when he heard the shots. "I would say we probably heard about seven or eight shots come, probably one block west of us, by the bus stop at Colfax and Lincoln. Honestly, we saw a lot of people running. I did not see a shooter.” The protest started at 5 p.m. with people carrying posters that read "Black Lives Matter” and chanting "Hey, hey! Ho, ho! Racist police have got to go” as they stood on the Capitol steps. Many wore masks because of public health concerns due to the coronavirus pandemic. "It's too easy to say we're in a pandemic,” Kira Pratt of Denver said. "Black people are at risk every day just living.” Joel Britton, a protester, had just arrived at the Capitol when the shots were fired. "People were scattering and running inside the Capitol,” he said. The protest, called "Justice for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Sean Reed & Others,” was organized on Facebook by two women, who called for a peaceful demonstration. Hyoung Chang, The Denver PostProtesters face Denver Police officers near 20th Street and Chestnut Place in Denver on Thursday. Denver's protests followed violent protests in Minneapolis, where people set fires and looted business. Protests Wednesday night in Los Angeles closed a major freeway. Just as the protest began, the Denver Police Department tweeted a message from Chief Paul Pazen, who extended sympathy to Floyd's family. The message also explained that the Minneapolis officers' method of restraining Floyd would be a violation of Denver's use-of-force policy. "The actions and type of force used by the Minneapolis police officers in the video are inexcusable and contrary to how we train officers,” Pazen's statement said. "Treating those we serve with respect is of the utmost importance to me as chief and those who make up the Denver Police Department. The Denver Police Department values the sanctity of life and is committed to respecting and protecting the dignity, safety and rights of our community members.” Denver police officers at the scene wore their regular street uniforms along with face masks to protect them from the virus. However, they began donning riot gear once the shots were fired. As the night wore on, the crowds grew larger. One group headed toward a police substation near Colfax Avenue and Washington Street, where people reportedly threw rocks at the building. But police in riot gear pushed them back onto Colfax. Mayor Michael Hancock tweeted that he understood why people were angry over Floyd's death but asked them to march in peace. "Responding to violence with violence will only lead to more violence,” he said.
