We're here to pick up the torch.” Organizers planned to march from City Hall and arrive at the Lorraine Motel at 6:01 for a moment of silence and the Commemoration at the National Civil Rights Museum, but marchers arrived once the ceremony was over. That's after starting several minutes late and making several stops along the way. "I mean I was kind of disappointed because I wanted to be here for the moment of silence because we promised a lot of people we're going to be right here,” Kathy said. Marchers did stop for a moment of silence before reaching the Lorrain Motel and hope their message of racial and economic just will still reach many. "As fast food workers we're out here fighting for higher wages and a right to live and with Black Lives Matter we're fighting against police retaliation,” Chris Ellis from Pennsylvania said. "Shows solidary there's love all around as you can see I mean we still did a wonderful job no matter what,” Kathy said. Once marchers reached the Lorrain Motel they gathered in prayer and reflected upon Dr. King's Legacy. © 2020 Cox Media Group Trending Now Missouri boy, 11, mowing lawns to donate money to Black Lives Matter By Cox Media Group National Content Desk Police still searching town for missing cows By Cox Media Group National Content Desk Coronavirus: Study shows certain COVID-19 antibodies decline over time By Debbie Lord, Cox Media Group National Content Desk Explosives detection dog retires after 8 years of service at Indiana airport By Cox Media Group National Content Desk Trump's Tulsa rally: What time, what channel, how to watch, livestream By Debbie Lord, Cox Media Group National Content Desk News Video Traffic Weather Download the Fox13 Weather App About Us What's on FOX13 FCC EEO Information FOX13 Public File © 2020 Cox Media Group.
