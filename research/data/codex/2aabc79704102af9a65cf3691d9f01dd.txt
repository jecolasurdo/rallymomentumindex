"Then why aren't you outraged?!!” The 16-year-old high school junior from central New Jersey had traveled to Baltimore with more than 20,000 other Muslims to attend the annual Islamic Circle of North America conference over the weekend. Hundreds of them came to McKeldin Square Sunday to protest the fatal shooting of an unarmed black Muslim man, Stephon Clark, by police in Sacramento, Calif., on March 18. Advertisement "At the end of the day, it's human dignity,” she said. "People are desensitized. They hear 'unarmed black man,' 'unarmed black man.' He was a father, he was a husband, he was a brother.

[More Maryland news] Baltimore eases coronavirus restrictions, as city moves to Phase 2 of the recovery » Police say they believe Clark was the suspect and he ran when a police helicopter responded, then did not obey officers' orders. That should have been no reason to shoot him, said Imam Omar Suleiman, founder and president of the Yaqeen Institute for Islamic Research and a professor of Islamic Studies at Southern Methodist University. "Why did he turn around and run?” Suleiman asked. "The way that police have been acting in this country — if they identified themselves as police officers — he still should have turned and ran away. ... Philando [Castile] didn't run from the police. Alton Sterling didn't run from the police. Jordan Edwards didn't run from the police. So don't tell me this is Stephon's fault for turning and running away.” Suleiman contrasted the officers' handling of the incident with those in South Carolina who managed to take Dylann Roof into custody unharmed after the white supremacist killed nine black worshippers in a historic church in Charleston in 2015. "Tell me that this is civilized,” he said. "Tell me that this is a democracy.

Bilal Ali, Baltimore's sole Muslim delegate, took particular issue with White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders' characterization of Clark's shooting as a "local matter” that "should be left up to local authorities.” "It's totally insane,” Ali said.

We have empirical data that clearly shows that these types of atrocities have been happening to people of color for years.” Karim Amin and his wife brought their 9-year-old, Rania, and their 3-year-old, Karim Jr., to the rally. Rania, a fifth-grader, said the event made her feel "like I can do anything.” Amin, the head organizer and president of the Muslim Social Services Agency, said Sunday's protest was a chance to harness the power of the tens of thousands of Muslims in town for the conference. "You have to take advantage of those moments,” he said. "A large portion of the conference was about social justice.” Nation & World Sacramento sheriff's cruiser hits woman during Stephon Clark protest and speeds away, video shows A 61-year-old woman was struck by a police vehicle as it peeled away from protesters demonstrating against the police killing of Stephon Clark in what was described by the victim and protesters as a hit and run. By Alex Horton and Rob Kuznia and Sawsan Morrar Apr 01, 2018 | 5:48 PM Mazen Mokhtar, executive director of the Muslim American Society, led the crowd in a call-and-response.
