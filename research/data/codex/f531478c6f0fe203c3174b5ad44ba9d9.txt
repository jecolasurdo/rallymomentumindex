Updated: 6:55 PM EDT Oct 15, 2016 Abby Isaacs NBC5 Reporter After Ben & Jerry's announced its support for the Black Lives Matter movement, a pro-law enforcement group called for a boycott of the Vermont-based ice cream company. In response, members of BLM Vermont showed solidarity, rallying outside the ice cream shop in Burlington. "We're gonna support them in spite of recent threats," BLM Vermont President Ebony Nyoni said. Blue Lives Matter posted a statement on its website Monday, saying Ben & Jerry's "accused law enforcement of widespread systematic and institutionalized racism." The post went on to denounce BLM, saying it's not a civil rights group. However, at Saturday's show of support, many did not agree. "People are entitled to their point of view," Chris Miller, activism manager for Ben & Jerry's, said. "I think this is the modern day civil rights movement. This movement all over the country was born out of a reaction to violence against people." "It's always discouraging but I'm going to stay encouraged because I know for every one person that doesn't support the movement of black lives, there are thousands and millions who do," Nyoni said.
