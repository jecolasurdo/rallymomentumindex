"I just believe that the injustice being shown in the past couple of years has been too much to handle. And I'm a little tired of it."So if I have to knee during the national anthem -- I still support the troops, and I still support the police officers who are doing their rightful job."Boyce said she would kneel throughout the season if she felt it were necessary."If it comes to that, if the message needs to be given every week, then yes, absolutely, I will do it every week," Boyce said.Dallas police chief David Brown was at midfield to do the coin flip.A quote from one student, who raised her fist pregame: pic.twitter.com/iUah0qYRvF— Grant McGalliard (@grantmcgalliard) September 24, 2016 Five black members of SMU's marching band knelt to play the national anthem before tonight's game vs. TCU.— David Ubben (@davidubben) September 23, 2016 Members of the #smu band kneel for the national anthem. pic.twitter.com/Zc3fvEZwAP— Nikki Chavanelle (@NikkiChavanelle) September 23, 2016 4 #SMU band members take a knee while playing national anthem tonight vs. TCU #ESPN #ponyuptempo pic.twitter.com/epW7ml2M9U— Rattle & Hum Sports (@CowboyCamp) September 24, 2016 Check out @SMU_Equipment lookin ❄️❄️❄️!! #PonyUpTempo #TeamDallas pic.twitter.com/1gHMiqx8lA— SMU FootbaII (@SMU_Football) September 23, 2016 More coverageSMU follows same sad script in 33-3 loss to TCUSomeone's in a 'lot of trouble' at TCU | Quotables from Battle for Iron SkilletGame provides peaceful platform for police support and those choosing to kneel during national anthemUp-tempo Frogs and uneasy Mustangs | Five takeaways from TCU's 33-3 win over SMUQuick hits: Upon further review, SMU safety ejected for targeting; more picks for MustangsPhotos: Dallas police chief David Brown on hand at Ford Stadium as TCU routs SMU in battle for Iron SkilletMembers of SMU football band, student section kneel for national anthemSMU safety ejected in first half of Battle for Iron SkilletCheck out the special Dallas skyline helmet decal SMU will wear tonight in honor of fallen police officersEmail IconGrant McGalliardG.MCGALLIARD@tcu.edu @grantmcgalliard Dallas Protest UpdatesCoronavirus UpdatesGraduation announcementsYour city's newsFind takeout & deliveryLocal business gift cardsInspired: Good newsTimeless in TexasCurious TexasNewspaper ArchivesPuzzles and gamesAl Día - Noticias en Español ObituariesToday's ePaperTop Sports StoriesThe story of Max Nady, and how his father Scott Nady is teaching him and learning all at the same timeFavorite Dallas Cowboys of all time?
