LOUIS • A few hours after 1,000-plus people marched through St. Louis University's campus Sunday afternoon, some students held a demonstration of their own about progress at the school since 2014.Since then, members from multiple student organizations and interests have crafted a list of demands of sorts and emailed them to SLU President Fred Pestello.The list adds new hopes under each of the 13 points in the Clock Tower Accords, a document that students and administrators agreed upon in 2014 after days of protests, sit ins and difficult conversations centered around race and equality at the Jesuit institution.The Accords include 13 areas of improvement, ranging from boosting financial support to African-American programs, to reevaluating and expanding scholarships for students of color. The additions by students this week would force the university to go a little bit further than the progress made since 2014.Instead of African-American students making up the majority of recipients of a Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. scholarship, the students now want 70 percent of recipients to be people of color. Leaders keep an interactive website updated online, and send out periodic announcements about progress, including one from earlier this month. Other items on the students' list, which was handed out around campus this week, include gender-neutral bathrooms in every building, more people of color on the admissions staff and a full scholarship for the daughter of Anthony Lamar Smith, who was fatally shot by former St. Louis office Jason Stockley, if she chooses to go to SLU.Pestello told the Post-Dispatch Friday that he doesn't want to comment on the list from students until he meets with them next week. Earlier this week, Pestello said "clearly a group of students are actively engaged in demonstration in the region and on campus and pushing for change,” and that he's "immensely proud” of them. 0 comments Tags St. Louis University Slu Saint Louis University Fred Pestello Clock Tower Accords Protest Be the first to know Get local news delivered to your inbox!
