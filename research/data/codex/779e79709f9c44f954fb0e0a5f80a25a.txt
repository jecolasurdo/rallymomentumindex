Police estimated a couple hundred people were involved in the march.The protesters marched along Meighan Boulevard before arriving at the Etowah County Detention Center, where they chanted in the direction of the jail.A number of Etowah County Sheriff's Office officers were standing out in front of the jail, and protesters chanted at them to take a knee.Sheriff Jonathon Horton joined the protesters and addressed them with a bullhorn, saying that he will be the first to admit that change is needed."I'm so proud to be a member of a community that regardless of what our faith is, our sex, our gender, our race, our politics — that we want to make our change in peace and do it the right way and be an example of how things can be changed and how things can move forward in a positive direction," he said.Horton led the group in prayer and asked deputies to kneel before God.The march continued down Broad Street, and though the plan was to go to the gazebo in front of city hall, shouts were exchanged between protesters and people at the Emma Sansom monument.Law enforcement officers moved in to separate the two groups: Gadsden police officers on the one side of Broad Street; Etowah County officers on the other.Marchers then gathered at the gazebo, where a number of people gave speeches."I've been out here all day, talking to who people say is our enemy," said Adrienne Reed. "They think it's blue against black, but it's not — it's righteousness versus injustice."There were calls to vote and get involved in local politics as a way of effecting change.Organizers read out their demands and calls to action for local law enforcement reforms and asked for a response from city leaders by the middle of the week.There was also a call and response, with organizers reading the names of those killed around the country by police officers in recent years and the crowd chanting "Say their name" between each name.Well before the marchers began their journey toward city hall, several people gathered at the gazebo in front of city hall. Their mission: to protect the Emma Sansom monument. There were about a dozen people there early; the number grew, it appeared, to about 20.Prior to the marchers' arrival, the group moved from the gazebo to the Elks Lodge.For a few days before Sunday's march, social media "propaganda" -- as Etowah County Sheriff Jonathon Horton called it -- claimed "Antifa" was coming to Gadsden on Sunday to tear down the monument, and damage both the chapel at Forrest Cemetery and the memorial at Patriots Park.Horton and Gadsden police investigated and found no credible threats, and leading up to the march, it appeared no attempts had been made to harm the monument.Still, those gathered -- most veterans, Norman Chaviers said -- felt the need to protect the monument, which to them, is a sign of their heritage. He called those gathered "Citizens against Anarchy.""God bless the USA and Robert E. Lee. I will not let that monument be defaced as long as I'm here," Hunter Phillips said. A member of the Sons of Confederate Veterans for decades, Phillips said he'd helped clean the monument for years. "I draw the line in the dust," he said, at the prospect of it being damaged."Your heritage means something, but mine doesn't? No," Phillips said, shaking his head. He said for a while he sat at the base of the monument, and some people driving by cursed him from their vehicles.The sheriff said he spoke to both groups prior to the march. He said he told the group at the gazebo that the marchers had a right to demonstrate and speak out without interference, just as their group had a right to be there."Everyone has given their word that it's going to be peaceful," Horton said. He said the organizers of the march were concerned about the claims on Facebook, too.Members of the group said Gadsden Police Chief Lamar Jaggears came out earlier. "He disarmed us," one members of the group said. They said he told them the police could not guarantee their safety.Those present to protect the statue said Horton talked to them, and told them they would be all right.Horton had communicated through Facebook over the weekend that under Alabama law, people cannot possess a firearm within 1,000 feet of a demonstration or protest, and even with permits, cannot have a firearm in a vehicle within 1,000 feet.Chaviers said he believes in "God, guts, and guns. It's always been that way and always will be."City Council member Jason Wilson took part in the march, and he commended Gadsden's officers for their professionalism in a Facebook post Sunday night.
