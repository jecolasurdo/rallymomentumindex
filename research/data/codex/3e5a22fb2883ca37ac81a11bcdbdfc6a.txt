JARAD JARMON, JOURNAL GAZETTE & TIMES-COURIER Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save CHARLESTON — Some Eastern Illinois University​ professors have put up Black Lives Matter flags in campus windows after students were told they wouldn't be allowed to raise the banner in the South Quad."It was clear that the African-American students on our campus did not feel supported," said mathematics professor Charles Delman, who started the effort.The student government association and university officials last year denied a request by students Morgan Colvin and Keshyra Bluminberg to have the Black Lives Matter flag be flown under the American flag during African-American Heritage Month. Officials have said the flagpole was not an appropriate place for a political statement. The Black Lives Matter movement was launched in 2013 to protest racial injustice. About 16 percent of Eastern's student population was black in the fall 2017 semester, the most recent data from the university of Institutional Research shows. Delman​ said that after the decision, he spoke with colleagues about whether they should display the flag in their offices. He passed out several in advance of Black History Month in February. "I decided I wanted to do something, and I hoped others would join me," Delman said.The flags are now visible on the west end of Old Main in several third-floor office windows of the mathematics and computer science department. Peter Andrews, a mathematics professor, said he put up the flag to show "support for the black community on campus, which is significant."Morgan Colvin, the EIU student who suggested the flag should be raised, could not be reached for comment. Yolanda Williams, EIU Minority Affairs director and vocal proponent of raising the flag, also was not available.EIU President David Glassman in a statement said he supports the staff members. "That the math faculty have chosen to display the BLM flag is their way of showing support to our students while advancing the university's long-held values of civic responsibility and respect for diversity," he said. "The university is especially appreciative of our faculty and their longstanding commitment to inclusive excellence." University officials have said the decision last year was not against Black Lives Matter."This issue does not apply exclusively to the BLM flag," Glassman said in a statement. "Rather -- similar to other universities across the state -- the administration decided to preserve our institution's primary flagpole for the American, State of Illinois, and POW/MIA flags." Delman said he thought arguments against the initial proposal were irrelevant, including that the flag would be a political statement. For him, it is an issue of basic human rights, not politics."Flying any flag is political," he said.​​ Delman said the student proposal remains a missed opportunity for Eastern."I felt the university should have the courage to support its own students and faculty and staff who are African-American who suffer discrimination of various kinds and levels every day," Delman said.Contact Jarad Jarmon at (217) 238-6839.
