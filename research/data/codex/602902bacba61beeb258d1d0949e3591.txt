(AP Photo/Sara Burnett) CHICAGO — Protests over a Missouri grand jury decision not to indict a police officer in shooting of Michael Brown are continuing in Chicago. About 200 people were demonstrating Friday in the Chicago plaza that's home to the city's historic water tower. It's located along Michigan Avenue, a popular shopping destination. Organizers called on demonstrators and passersby to boycott shopping on Black Friday as a show of solidarity with protesters in Ferguson, Missouri. A grand jury on Monday decided that a white Ferguson police offer should not face criminal charges in the shooting death of Brown, a black 18-year-old who was unarmed. Twenty-eight-year-old Kristiana Colon is a member of a group that's been taking supplies such as gas masks to protesters in Ferguson. She says demonstrators want shoppers to think before buying.
