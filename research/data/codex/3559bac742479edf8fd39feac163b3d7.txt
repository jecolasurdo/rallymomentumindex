Omaha North wasn't on the field for the anthem. CHRIS MACHIAN/THE WORLD-HERALD Sterling Smith said he has had relatives in the military who sometimes weren't treated well. "They pledged allegiance to a flag that didn't pledge allegiance to them,” he said. Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Lincoln Southeast senior football player Sterling Smith says he will proudly take a knee again Friday when the national anthem is played before the Knights' game against top-ranked Omaha North at Seacrest Field.By kneeling, he hopes to keep the conversation going about social injustice, taking a lead from San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who has knelt before NFL games during the national anthem since the preseason.Smith and teammate Michael Baklykov knelt at last week's game against Lincoln East, and Smith said he'll do the same at every game the rest of the season. As of Wednesday, Smith said he was not aware of any other teammates or players from North who plan to join him in kneeling."It's just something I felt I needed to do,” Smith said. "I'm proud it kind of got people's attention to talk about it. It's not about me — it's about the bigger picture.”The 49ers' Kaepernick first knelt during the anthem in an NFL preseason game in protest of what he deems are wrongdoings against blacks and minorities in the United States.Kaepernick, who is biracial and was adopted and raised by white parents and siblings, explained his stance:"I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”Smith and Baklykov are believed to be the first players in Nebraska to not stand for the anthem, but other high school players across the country have joined in.Smith and his teammate broke no rules, say school officials in Nebraska.The Lincoln Public Schools said in a statement that while it's a time-honored tradition to stand, the organization recognizes that no one is legally required to do so.Omaha Public Schools shared that sentiment. A statement from OPS director of district communications Monique Farmer read: "Students are within their First Amendment rights to exercise free speech as long as they do so respectfully, and without disruption to the school environment or the learning environment.”Jim Tenopir, executive director of the Nebraska School Activities Association, said the issue is on the NSAA radar. LPS officials contacted him this week "and wanted to know what our response was on that.”"My response was that we prefer kids stand at attention, but we also understand that there are people who have very closely held beliefs about social injustice,” Tenopir said during Thursday's monthly NSAA board meeting. "Basically, that was my way of saying, 'Local schools, you address that as you see fit.'"I think (the NSAA) is in a tough way if we come out and try to diss, if you will, the feelings that there are some social issues in this country that people are concerned about and are not getting the attention that they deserve.” Tenopir said the NSAA's stance would change if someone were harmed or an activity was disrupted. He's only received a few calls since news spread about the two Southeast students kneeling last Friday.Southeast Principal Brent Toalson has responded to a few community members who have had concerns, questions and offers of support, said Mary Kay Roth, director of communications for LPS.Smith, 18, whose family heritage includes black and Hispanic, is a starting tight end and middle linebacker. He said a lot of his teammates and some coaches have said they support his decision, because they respect that he is taking a stand about a social issue. Most of the 40 to 50 responses he's received on social media have been positive.But he's also had some negative ones, such as, "if you don't stand for the flag, we'll give you a reason to sit” or "we know where you live.”"I knew that was coming,” Smith said. "I am more interested in pushing for the change than the negativity.”Roth said school district officials are aware of the comments but don't plan to beef up security for Friday's 4:30 p.m. game. She said LPS already has appropriate security personnel at games, including off-duty police officers and high school administrators.Roth said they spoke to Smith and his parents after hearing about the negative comments."Our Lincoln Public Schools security director is following up, and we have urged the student to contact the school and Lincoln police if he receives anything he perceives as a threat,” Roth said. "As always, we are closely monitoring Southeast and all our high schools to make sure our students continue to learn in a safe and healthy environment.”Smith said his decision not to stand wasn't an action against veterans or a sign of disrespect. He and his sister, Simone, have long been interested in civil rights, and Smith said he wants to advocate for civil rights in the future.He's been involved in Black Lives Matter and Martin Luther King events. This weekend, he plans to join the pipeline protest in North Dakota."I've done the research, I know the facts and it's something I feel strongly about,” Smith said. "It's something we need to discuss.”Smith has had several relatives who have served in the military, including grandfathers, cousins and uncles. As minorities, they sometimes weren't treated well there or when they returned home, Smith said."They pledged allegiance to a flag that didn't pledge allegiance to them,” he said.World-Herald staff writer Stu Pospisil contributed to this report.marjie.ducey@owh.com, 402-444-1034, twitter.com/mduceyowh Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save More information Top-ranked Omaha North shuts out No. 8 Lincoln Southeast Omaha North mixed a nice dose of play-action passes with its bruising ground game Friday night in rolling to a 42-0 victory over Lincoln Southeast.
