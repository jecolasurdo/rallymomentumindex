"It's a systemic problem that hasn't changed since the civil rights movement."National statistics show African Americans face disparities in unemployment, household income, educational attainment, incarceration and health outcomes.The group plans to hold regular vigils under the name of a movement that started in 2013 after the shooting of Trayvon Martin in Florida and gained momentum after the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri."For a lot of people, 'Black Lives Matter' has to do with the Ferguson shootings. But it needs to be about treating African Americans fairly," said demonstrator Jane Martin Buckler, citing broader inequities "like access to health care, like food deserts ... high school dropout rates."Story continues after the gallery.Noah Parker, one of the few African Americans present, who was attending the church as a guest, said he was heartened to see the turnout."This is a very important message," he said. "Local politicians should get more involved and focus on solutions."Buckler pointed to a sign on the church reading "Civil Marriage is a Civil Right," which the church plans to take down after Friday's Supreme Court decision legalizing gay marriage.But she said it's also a reminder that such decisions do not guarantee an end to discrimination for many segments of society, including African Americans."We haven't won these battles," she said.As the group sang songs Sunday outside the church on South Fourth Street, passing cars honked their horns to show support."Our goal is really to engage the community in conversation. This is a controversial topic. We hear a lot of 'all lives matter.' We agree," Gapsis said. "But we're taking this time to specifically say, historically, black lives have not mattered in this country."Reporter Chris Kenning can be reached at (502) 582-4697.
