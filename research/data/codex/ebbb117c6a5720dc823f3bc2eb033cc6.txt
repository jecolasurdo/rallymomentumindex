(FergusonOctober is an organized wave of resistance calling for justice and lasting change in the wake of the shooting death of Ferguson teenager Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson.) The free event drew a capacity crowd to Fubar that spilled out onto Locust Street, where some of those who couldn't get in gathered in drum circles and small protest groups to deliver various chants. Brooklyn rapper Kweli, who visited Ferguson shortly after Michael Brown's death, mixed his hits such as "The Blast,” "Get By” and "Get Em High” with messages of encouragement. "It's a journey, not a destination,” he said, adding that the relevancy of his old Black Star song "K.O.S. (Determination),” short for knowledge of self, proves there is plenty of work to do.Kweli also told the crowd to stay focused and received loud cheers when one lyric said it was time to look for new leaders. Kweli added: "Black lives matter. All lives matter. But we're the ones who have to stand up,” before leaving the stage.New York duo Dead Prez offered up "That's War” and "Politrikkks” amid saluting those who've sacrificed, delivered leadership and stood up for justice."All power to the people. There's a new slogan erupting right here,” Dead Prez said, calling for power to be taken away from the state and given to the people. West said for him, it was a beautiful thing to be an "old school brother” seeing the "new school brothers and sisters” standing up for justice. "The only way we can be free is when we're no longer sleepwalking,” said West. Rapper Chuck D of Public Enemy called in and told the crowd it was time for older people to let the younger people lead, while the older generation offers advice and guidance.Prisoner Mumia-Abu Jamal called in as well. Community organizer and activist Rosa Clemente applauded the work youths are doing as well and said what they're doing is historic.Actor Williams told the crowd to be just as ready for an indictment of Wilson as they should be for a lack of indictment, and to make sure their demands and directives are clear.Poe fired on all cylinders during his intense closing set that included his "Malcolm X,” "Coming Outta Missouri” and "Hog in the Lane,” which he performed with Knuckles. What he lacked in words addressing the crowd, he made up for in performance, which included several leaps from the stage to the floor. Knuckles' hyped set was a family affair, with Poe, Doorway, and the group Family Affair. Doorway's set included the young sons of rapper Rt-faq, who frequently perform with Doorway. Bo Dean's set included his hit "Chi Chi” and well as nonprintable chants of "FTP” (think of the old N.W.A. song).Rapper T-Dubb-O told the crowd it was time to stop talking about the situation and do something about it. He said his music tells the story of Brown and others like Brown, through his eyes.Singer Aloha Mi'sho brought some R&B to the proceedings with a cover of Lil Wayne's "How to Love” and more. Her personal plea was one of coming together. Lost Voices kicked off the event with the day's first crowd-and-response chant of "hands up, don't shoot.” "We do this for Michael Brown.” Cheeraz Gorman was among the poets who offered a few words.DJ Needles, DJ Divi and Kimmy Nu kept the music moving throughout with day with tunes that ranged from Arrested Development to Public Enemy to Fela Kuti. Finsta, Robert "Rob Boo” Ford and Blaze Brown hosted. Rapper David Banner, who had been scheduled to perform, did not make the event. He was said to have opted out of the event after tensions surrounding the event arose. Johnetta Elzie, a front-line Ferguson protester who addressed the crowd, said "I'm not sure if you came out for some type of show, but this is real life.” 0 comments Tags Kevin C.
