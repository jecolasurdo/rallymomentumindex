ACTBAC has been labeled a "neo-Confederate hate group” by the Southern Poverty Law Center and is known for raising Confederate flags and organizing pro-Confederate demonstrations throughout Alamance and Orange counties.Students and counter-protesters had announced a "Silent Sam Dance Party and Speakout” before ACTBAC's planned tribute, which they called "Silent Sam Stump.”At least half a dozen police departments were on scene, including those of UNC-Greensboro, UNC-Wilmington, city of Greensboro, UNC-Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill police and the Durham County Sheriff's Office. State Bureau of Investigation agents were also on scene and a helicopter was in the sky.Police had set up a series of barricades for the service. One ring of barricades was placed around the pedestal itself. A second ring was placed around the pedestal so that ACTBAC could be near the pedestal without directly touching it. A third ring was then placed around the second, which is where police were stationed throughout the night to separate ACTBAC and counter-protesters. The rings provided a 360-degree look at ACTBAC and police.Counter-protesters began showing up around 7:15 p.m. Some carried signs reading "Their statue, our blood,” "Tear it down,” "Black Lives Matter,” "White silence is white violence” and "Sorry about your participation trophy.” One girl carried a handmade wreath saying "[Expletive] your monument to white supremacy” while another had a flag stating "We will tread.”Around 7:30, a man not with ACTBAC named Kevin Taylor arrived carrying a Confederate flag. Taylor told the crowd that Silent Sam was for everyone who fought and died in the Civil War, black and white."It was not just for white supremacists, no. I don't support the white supremacists,” Taylor said.He added that he wanted to see Silent Sam reinstalled and then left alone, and that every Confederate statue should be left alone as "they ain't harming nobody.”Anon Cole, a counter-protester, approached Taylor and began shouting "Nazi go home!”"There is no [expletive] place for fascism. Get the [expletive] out of here. Your Confederate flag stands for the same thing the [expletive] swastika does: the oppression of people who don't look like you,” Cole said. "Go the [expletive] home. "We don't need you here. Nazis, get the [expletive] out. Nazis aren't welcome on the Chapel Hall campus.”The crowd began chanting "Nazis go home,” "No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA,” "Black lives, they matter here” and "Trans lives, they matter here” before police attempted to break up the group by using their bikes and whistles. They escorted Taylor to the second barricade where he held up his flag. The crowd then chanted "Cops and Klan go hand in hand” before shouting obscenities to Taylor.Police began pushing the crowd away from the barricades with their bicycles and shouted "Move!” Counter-protesters responded with "Back up! Back up! We want freedom! Freedom! All these racist ass cops, we don't need them! Need them!”Around 7:45, the dance party began with a group of students playing music on loudspeakers. Dancers grooved to "This is America” by Childish Gambino and other songs while they wore glow sticks in their hair and clothes. The dance party raged on until ACTBAC left.At 8 p.m., police used their bicycles again to section off an area of McCorkle Place so counter-protesters had to go all the way around the outer barricade to get to the other side.ACTBAC entered the area around 8:10 with 40 or so members. They were immediately escorted to the inner barricade in a single-file line with police on bicycles surrounding them. The counter-protesters chanted "Nazis go home!” and yelled at officers, asking them why they were protecting ACTBAC."Why are you protecting this [expletive] hatred?” one counter-protester shouted.Chants ranged from "Go the [expletive] home” to "[Expletive] you Nazis!” to "When black lives are under attack, what do we do? Stand up, fight back!” to "I believe that we will win” to "Go home racists.” Police told counter-protesters to get back and were then faced with the chant "Who do you protect? Who do you serve?”Meanwhile, ACTBAC members started with a group prayer before pulling out a huge Confederate flag and making rebel war cries. One member had two pool noodles duct taped together with a flag as he was not allowed a real flag pole."They ought to be ashamed of theyselves,” said one counter-protester.Counter-protesters responded with chants and shouts against the Confederate flag and Silent Sam. The group was able to drown out ACTBAC for most of the service and chanted "We can't hear you” at them.By 8:45 p.m., no violence had occurred but police continued to push and shove counter-protesters away from the barricades. ACTBAC founder and president Gary Williamson was seen inside the barricade, taking pictures of ACTBAC.At 9 p.m., police gathered to escort ACTBAC to the Morehead Planetarium parking lot via single-file line with police on bikes on both sides of the group. Two officers on four-wheelers led the group while others shouted at counter-protesters "Move!” and told them they could not be on the same sidewalk as ACTBAC. The crowd chanted "Go home Nazis!” as they followed ACTBAC and police to the parking lot. ACTBAC was given a part of the parking lot that was sectioned off from the crowd with barricades. Counter-protesters shouted "Go home” and "Don't come back” as ACTBAC filed through the barricade and began getting in their cars.Police then deployed a pepper fogger on the crowd. In videos, it looked like Greensboro police were responsible for deploying the pepper fogger. Greensboro Police Department PIO Ron Glenn said he could not confirm that Greensboro police did use pepper spray. UNC-CH claimed the pepper fogger was deployed to maintain order but refused to comment on how deploying a pepper fogger into a crowd would maintain order.By Friday evening, UNC-CH released a statement on behalf of UNC police, saying that they are not currenty sharing information on which department or agency used the pepper fog."A pepper fogger was used because it was deemed necessary to maintain officer safety and order," the statement read. "Individual officers determine when to use pepper fogger, and it is driven by the circumstances of the moment."The crowd of counter-protesters immediately began coughing and gagging after the pepper fogger was deployed. Some were screaming for water as people struggled to breathe. The crowd then turned its attention to the police and chanted "Cops go home!” and "Who do you protect? Who do you serve?” as well as "Nazis go home!”At 10 p.m., ACTBAC posted on their Facebook page a thank you message to everyone that joined them."We are proud as we have ever been,” the message read. "We spoke for Sam, our lord, our monuments all across the Southland and to all the amazing Southern people. Stand up, get involved and be proud. God bless you and lord oh lord bless our sweet Dixieland.”At 10:15 p.m., UNC Media Relations Manager Carly Miller sent out an email saying three people had been arrested; two for affray and the third for resisting an officer. A second bomb had also been used to disperse the crowd.UNC-CH sent out a new release Friday at 1 p.m. stating the three individuals were charged with resisting, delaying or obstructing an officer. None of the individuals are affiliated with the university:- Cammy Lee Morgan, 25- Mary Frances Rosen, 23- Shannon Maclaughlin, 24UNC-CH Chancellor Carol L. Folt held a press conference call at 3:45 p.m. Friday and opened by explaining that the university is looking at opportunities for the statue's location. The UNC Board of Governors gave the Board of Trustees and Folt a path to "identify a safe, legal and alternative location for the monument” three days ago, Folt said."We will be presenting President [Margaret] Spellings and the Board of Governors this plan by Nov. 15,” Folt said. "I have been very grateful for the path forward to move towards a healing and peace process from what is conflict and disharmony.”Folt went on to say that Silent Sam has been a "divisive symbol” and a "threat to public safety and a distraction from [UNC's] mission” that has caused pain and hurt for people. At the same time, the monument has served as a memorial for fallen soldiers during the Civil War."We all know that the disputes about the monument are deeply rooted and include profound struggles of race and inclusion, history and honor, that we here and across the nation need to resolve,” Folt said. "I hope that we can all appreciate that there is a big difference between commemorating fallen and people who want restoration of white rule.”Folk concluded by saying the university will work on taking suggestions from the campus, Spelling, the Board of Governors, Legislature and citizens from North Carolina and the nation."It will require us to reach deep into our hearts and across the state to the people we serve,” Folt said. "We have to listen to their ideas, evaluate the options, focus on what we can do and to get it done."Silent Sam has a place in our history and on our campus where its history can be taught but not at the front door of a safe, welcoming, proudly public research university,” Folt continued. "I am confident that Tar Heels from here and across the state can unite around this democratic process and share goals for a safe, outstanding university, which values and respects all.”UNC-CH refused to comment on all the police departments involved during the protest, why the university allowed ACTBAC to have their twilight service and when the crowd fully dispersed.
