Meanwhile, Dallas Area Rapid Transit said it was suspending service in downtown Dallas to protect passengers and staff.And graphic video surfaced Saturday evening showing a group savagely attacking an unidentified man, stomping and kicking him near the House of Blues in Victory Park. He was hospitalized in stable condition, Dallas Police spokesman Sgt. Warren Mitchell said, but police had no information on any arrests related to the incident.Cities across the country have seen increasing unrest after the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis as an officer knelt on his neck during an arrest. Video of the arrest, which occurred after Floyd allegedly used a counterfeit bill at a convenience store, sparked nationwide outcry and has led to more urgent demands for police to be held accountable.Officer Derek Chauvin has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death.Early Saturday afternoon in Dallas, several hundred people of various ages and races had gathered peacefully at City Hall, chanting "No more” as workers inside peered from the windows."How do you spell racist: DPD?" the crowd asked, turning its attention to the building.Then those gathered took a knee."Say his name,” they demanded. "George Floyd.”Protesters take a knee during downtown Dallas demonstrations.(Vernon Bryant / Staff Photographer)But within hours, the mood would turn combative, with clouds of tear gas wafting throughout the municipal plaza and officers behind riot shields threatening pepper spray as the angry crowds swelled to over 1,000 and traversed the same downtown streets where stores had been looted and landmarks vandalized the night before.Friday's demonstration drew over 1,000 people to Dallas police headquarters, prefacing an unruly, chaotic march in which some resorted to violence and disorder to vent their frustrations, toppling trash bins, blocking roadways and pelting police squad cars with water bottles.As events tested police patience, the department posted a statement on Twitter warning against such behavior: "We respect the rights of peaceful protesters, but violence or destruction of property is unacceptable,” it said.NewsProtests in Dallas, Fort Worth seek justice for black Americans killed by policeBy Tom Steele, Sam Blum, Dave Boucher, Obed Manuel and Marc RamirezGov. Greg Abbott said Saturday that he had marshaled the Texas National Guard and state troopers in response to the unrest in Dallas and elsewhere in Texas."Texas and America mourn the senseless loss of George Floyd, and the actions that led to his death are reprehensible and should be condemned in the strongest terms possible,” Abbott said Saturday afternoon in a statement announcing the deployment of 1,500 Texas Department of Public Safety troopers to Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin."Texans have every right to exercise their First Amendment rights, but violence and looting will not be tolerated,” the governor said.Still, Saturday's protests continued for hours as demonstrators took to the streets. By early evening, some were spilling onto Woodall Rogers Freeway, tying up traffic and prompting police calls for backup.Social media posts and comments from Dallas officials earlier in the day suggested that area malls might be looted. Police ramped up their presence accordingly, but the threats didn't pan out. NorthPark Center, Galleria Dallas and Highland Park Village all shut down early Saturday, and Target closed and boarded up several of its locations in Dallas and Austin.NOW: protestors in #Dallas are now blocking US75 northbound - some walking - approaching Hall St@wfaa pic.twitter.com/vfaj9xydz6— David Goins (@dgoins) May 31, 2020 Saturday afternoon, a few dozen officers patrolled the empty NorthPark property, which had been shut down out of an "abundance of caution” at the recommendation of police. A similar scene played out at the Galleria, where entrances were barricaded and an SUV was stationed in front of the mall entrance to keep people from walking in.Lemuel Randolph was among those who attended Saturday's event at City Hall, mindful of his two sons and his daughter.The Target on Haskell is closed and boarded up. I was just at a Plano location this morning. Is anyone seeing this at other Dallas locations? @keranews pic.twitter.com/U7bI44XOhj— Miguel Perez (@quillindie) May 30, 2020 "To know that I'm 54 years old and I have two African-American young men that I'm trying to push into the world, and to see these kind of things continue unabated — it just gets to you,” he said.Dellandra Musa, 26, said she was there because she believes the country and city need police policy reform."We need policies that put 'Black Lives Matter' into the equation of 'All Lives Matter,'” she said. "We shouldn't fear the people who are supposed to protect us.”Musa said she wasn't at Friday night's protest and didn't approve of the unrest fueled by some in the crowd because believes in peaceful protesting."I don't believe in destruction. I believe in systems that are going to protect us,” she said.As the afternoon wore on, the crowd marched through downtown. As the group crossed Main Street, site of much of last night's destruction, drivers stepped out of their cars and honked their horns in solidarity.RetailNorthPark Center and Galleria Dallas to close again on Sunday after protests continue in DallasBy Maria Halkias, Jeremy Hallock and Tina DanzeAfter making a brief loop downtown, the protesters ended up back at City Hall. That's when the situation escalated, with police firing tear gas and protesters once again hitting the streets.Officers in riot gear lined up in front of the bronze steers at Pioneer Plaza, at Young and Griffin Streets, warning protesters to move back.But the crowd swelled in protest when a young woman was taken into custody for not following orders, forced onto the ground and put in zip ties."That's how you treat your wife,” one female protester taunted.The line of officers pushed north on Griffin, deploying flash bangs and firing pepper spray and tear gas canisters."Walk back. Don't run,” protester Michael Leon Cornute instructed the crowd, using a megaphone.Hundreds attended Saturday's demonstrations in Dallas.(Juan Figueroa / Staff Photographer)Later, as demonstrators crossed back through downtown, Cornute — born in Oak Cliff — said he was surprised to see as many white allies as turned up in Saturday's march."We're not civilized by any means if we can't figure out a way to treat each other with dignity and respect,” he said.Cornute said he didn't approve of how some protesters handled themselves Friday."I feel like there's some mature consciousness in the crowd, and then there's someone that's just ready to go crazy,” he said. "Unfortunately, that's a symptom of the times that we live in. Everyone don't got common sense. So the ones that don't have common sense, they're trying to be proactive, and stand with us, but they've got short tempers. They see an opportunity and they go for it.”At Commerce and Pearl, Ashunti Radford and Jenika Moncada had been pushing a stroller carrying Moncada's two-year-old son Valentin away from the conflict when police fired tear gas in their direction.Moncada poured milk into her son's eyes to relieve his pain."It's wild,” Radford said. "They wouldn't let us leave. They just kept following us.”Through the late afternoon and evening, the protest never hit a frenzied pitch. While some threw water bottles at police officers, and a small group of others tagged buildings and boarded-up windows with "BLM” — for "Black Lives Matter” — and other more profane slogans, such instances were outliers.Saturday's rally was organized after the death this week of George Floyd in Minneapolis while he was in police custody.(Juan Figueroa / Staff Photographer)When a few protesters started to enter a 7-Eleven at Commerce and Harwood streets, a crowd gathered to shout them down and others pulled them out of the store to thwart any potential looting.Kelani Young, 24, said she had been motivated to attend the afternoon's rally by the killing of Botham Jean, a black man who was sitting in his apartment when he was shot dead by since-convicted Dallas police officer Amber Guyger, who mistook the apartment for her own."We really came out to protest in Dallas today because the Dallas Police Department failed Botham when they allowed the police officer to get away with just the smallest sentence. She walked into the apartment and killed him. ... In Minnesota, they have to realize they're not alone."She and others said there are reasons that many protests have taken violent turns."I feel like Trump set a tone yesterday when he tweeted about 'when the looting starts the shooting starts.' ... We're trying to be as peaceful as possible and they're still trying to torment.”Alexis Randles, 34, said she was at Friday's protest but left before tensions escalated between police and demonstrators."People are upset, and I can't tell you how you're supposed to protest,” she said.Email IconObed Manuel, Staff Writer.
