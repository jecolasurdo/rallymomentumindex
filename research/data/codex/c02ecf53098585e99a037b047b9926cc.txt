Michael Pfleger, pastor of St. Sabina Roman Catholic Church, participated, alongside other supporters who displayed upside-down American flags and a sign reading "Cops, stop killing us.” Brown said he wanted a fair investigation after Joshua Beal, 25, of Indianapolis, was shot and killed near 111th and Troy streets, just east of Kedzie, on Nov. 5. According to police, a road-rage incident took place; an altercation ensued, and two off-duty CPD members became involved in the altercation. The man was shot and killed, police said, after he exited a vehicle and displayed a weapon.Beal's family said Beal had a permit to carry a gun, with his sister saying he could bring it "wherever he goes.” They also said he told police he had a concealed-carry permit. Video provided by a witness appears to show Beal pointing a gun during the dispute.Brown, who ran for 5th Ward alderman in 2015, said that black lives "have not mattered.” He said he wanted the truth about what happened in the shooting."We are not out here for anything but peace and justice,” Brown said. "We want peace. We want justice. ... We are not out there to spew hatred at the men and women in blue.”Pfleger led a prayer, and Green sang the national anthem.Several protesters knelt during Pfleger's prayer, in which he tried to appeal to police supporters by saying he was a Catholic priest coming to a Catholic area. He prayed to "change the hearts of prejudice and bigotry.” "This is a city of all people,” Pfleger said, "where we are called to be brothers and sisters. We have to right to come to an altar unless we are first one with each other."We come in peace. We speak peace,” he added. "We demand peace.”The Blue Lives Matter crowd chanted "CPD!” several times in support of the Chicago Police Department, and at times, an air horn was used to try to drown out Black Lives Matter supporters who were speaking with a microphone in the middle of the intersection. They also chanted, "Go home now!” and displayed several black and blue American flags, regularly used to show support for police.One supporter yelled that it was a "justified killing” because Beal pulled a gun.A similar protest took place on Nov. 6 in the same area, although the second one included more participants and a much larger police presence.Afterward, Green, who has been involved in criticizing other high-profile police shootings, announced on social media he was taking a break from protesting.However, reports of another Black Lives Matter protest also surfaced, with this one to take place on Nov. 20, again at 111th and Kedzie.According to Mia Sissac, a spokesperson for the Independent Police Review Authority (IPRA), the investigation into the incident is "in progress.” She did not share other details.According to Sissac, more information will be released within 60 days of the incident, and updates, including videos and photos, will be available at iprachicago.org.
