LOUIS • Protesters and counterprotesters squared off Tuesday evening at the Confederate Memorial in Forest Park.The groups on opposite sides of the debate over whether the statue on the north side of the park near the Missouri History Museum should stay or go were mostly peaceful in their separate protests.The monument has been targeted for relocation by Mayor Lyda Krewson, as it was by her predecessor. It's part of a national movement in some cities to relocate Confederate statuary away from public spaces due to their connection to slavery and white supremacy. Earlier this month, City Treasurer Tishaura Jones started a GoFundMe page to raise money for the removal of the monument, dedicated in 1914. A group supporting the statue's removal had planned Tuesday's protest via a Facebook page but then canceled it due to weather. Yet, a group of demonstrators formed despite the weather to protest the monument."I am pleased that a broad cross-section of St. Louis came out to stand against racism," said demonstrator Susan Clark. "We had people of all colors, creeds and backgrounds. Together." Clark had organized the protest that had been canceled.

Photo by Robert Cohen, rcohen@post-dispatch.com Some who traveled from outside St. Louis to defend the monument said they understand why it upsets and offends people, but want to preserve history. One man carried a Confederate flag.Other supporters suggested the monument be moved to Jefferson Barracks, a military cemetery in south St. Louis County.But those who want the monument to come down say it symbolizes hatred and a hurtful past they want removed. Many called those in favor of the relic white supremacists and Nazis. Some of them had "Black Lives Matter" signs. People on both sides of the issue contended they were exercising a First Amendment right to be present. A line of St. Louis Police officers watched as the groups gathered near the monument, which was ringed by a waist-high metal barrier. At one point, some of the protesters went through the barricade and marred the statue with a comment that included a profanity.Overnight the monument was vandalized with blue spray paint and phrases including "stop defending injustice," "this is treason," "no KKK" and "black lives matter."Employees of the St. Louis parks department began removing the paint shortly after 7 a.m. Spray paint is seen on the base of the Confederate Civil War monument in Forest Park as seen on Wednesday, May 24, 2017. Protesters who want the monument removed and supporters clashed at the site on Tuesday night. In the overnight hours, the monument was defaced with spray paint.
