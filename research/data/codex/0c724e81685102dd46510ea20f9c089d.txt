SANFORD – About 60 demonstrators -- some yelling "hands up, don't shoot!" -- marched Sunday night from Red Barber Park to the Sanford Police Department in a Black Lives Matter protest. Wil Blunt, 23, said he came to spread a message. Advertisement "We shouldn't let the individual acts of certain people distort our perspective of a whole group of people," said the Orlando man, referring to both police officers and the black community. ... "I want unity in my community. I just don't want to see bitterness and hatred consume the hearts of people." Janiel Calyin-Watson, 23, heard the news about three police officers shot and killed Sunday in Baton Rouge, La., on her way to the march. Advertisement "It's heartbreaking, but it didn't deter me at all," she said. "My mother actually warned me about coming out here because you never know what could happen. But those people don't stand for our cause of unity, equality and peace. We have to speak over them." She and her friend Raquel Earle, 24, wore all black and decorated their T-shirts with a peace sign and the letters "BLM" in red and green lettering. Calyin-Watson, who has a 2-year-old son, said she feels it's her duty to stand up for the cause. "That could be him," she said. "We need to change the way law enforcement is so our future generations won't see these injustices." Less than two weeks ago, Alton Sterling, a 37-year-old black man, was shot and killed by police in Baton Rouge during a confrontation that sparked nightly protests across the city that reverberated nationwide. A day after Sterling's death, Philando Castile, another black man, was killed by police in Minnesota. Organizers for the Sanford event say the protest was planned in light of both of their deaths, along with the 2012 killing of 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in Sanford by Neighborhood Watch volunteer George Zimmerman. Helen White, 45, rallied in Sanford after Trayvon's death and again after Zimmerman's acquittal. "I had to get out there because I believe what happened was unjust," she said. "... I've learned to put that behind me and move on, but it gets tough hearing these stories over and over again of others having similar problems."

A week ago, several thousand demonstrators marched through the streets of downtown Orlando for a Black Lives Matter rally. But Demarkus Johnson, president of the Black Lives Matter Florida chapter, said that even though the Sanford crowd wasn't as large as he'd hoped, their message was still heard. "Even if it was just five people, they can still make a difference," he said. "We were united today as brothers and sisters. It's one step in the right direction for change." Sanford Police Chief Cecil Smith came to the protest after hearing about the Baton Rouge police officer deaths. Advertisement "It's just really heartbreaking to see that so many people in our community now don't appreciate the fact that we put on our badge and our clothes and we go out to serve and protect in the community," he said. "The loss of respect, the loss of acknowledgment becomes a little disheartening." Smith spoke with some of the protesters as they gathered in the park before the rally. He said his officers were there to protect the participants. "Sanford has been a safe and sound and quiet community since the events with Trayvon Martin," he said. "It's important for them to come into our community and leave our community the same way that they found it." Starregina Lawrence of Sanford said she thinks deeper connections between officers and the communities they work with will help reduce fear and violence.
