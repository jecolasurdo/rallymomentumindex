(KKTV) - Demonstrators took to the streets for the second time in less than five days, protesting in the wake of a controversial officer-involved shooting which killed 19-year-old De'Von Bailey. Protesters lined up near Acacia Park and marched to City Hall, carrying signs and chanting "no justice, no peace" and other things having to do with gun violence. "We are against gun violence in our city, like, we don't want police shootings. We don't want gun violence,” Shayana Dabney said. Dabney is the president of the Black Student Union at CSU-Pueblo. She helped organize Saturday's protest. She says she wants to make sure every victim of gun violence seeks justice and answers. A lot of protesters told 11 News the gun violence epidemic is everywhere. "It's not just a problem in Colorado Springs. It's a problem nationally," Angelyna Reid said. Due to the protest, the Colorado Springs Police Department sent out a warning Saturday morning, making sure the public was aware of a planned protest. Residents near the Police Operations Center received a Everbridge notification around 11 a.m. It was intended for people within a 2-mile radius of the POC. Here's what the message said: "This is the Colorado Springs Police Department with an important message. There is a police activity related to a planned protest in the area of 705 S. Nevada. You are asked to stay indoors and avoid the area. CSPD will send an all-clear message when appropriate." Several local residents have expressed outrage over a recent officer-involved shooting.
