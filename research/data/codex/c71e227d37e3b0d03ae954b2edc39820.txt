Valdes.Members of the Black Lives Matter movement protest for more information to be released related to a police-involved shooting that occurred over the weekend. The prosecutor's office is handling the ongoing investigation and has not identified Bouie or the officers involved. The man was "acting erratically" when he was shot Saturday in the abdomen by a female police officer, Valdes said.The man survived, and was being treated at St. Joseph's Regional Medical Center, Valdes said.Bouie was unarmed when he was shot, Black Lives Matter protesters in Paterson said Monday as about two dozen rallied outside of police headquarters.The protesters said Bouie is mentally disturbed and wondered whether there should've been mental health professionals on the scene to assess him.The protesters had several demands, including that the name of the officer and any video under review in the investigation be released. Valdes, asked to respond to these requests, said additional statements will be released when the investigation is concluded."All we want is truth and transparency," said Alexis Miller, a leader in Paterson's Black Lives Matter movement.Gregory Bouie, who said he is Larry's brother and was there when he was shot, said that he had visited the hospital, but wouldn't comment on his brother's condition. At the rally, he said a few words and thanked the people who had come out to support his family."They did something very wrong to my brother," he said.Sara Jerde may be reached at sjerde@njadvancemedia.com.
