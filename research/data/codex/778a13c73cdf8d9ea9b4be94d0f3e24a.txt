Protest in Oshkosh draws hundreds amid George Floyd death, remains peacefulJerell Rushin, Oshkosh Northwestern Published 9:17 p.m. CT May 31, 2020 | Updated 9:22 p.m. CT May 31, 2020CLOSE Hundreds in Oshkosh protested police brutality amid the death of clack man George Floyd. Oshkosh NorthwesternCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREOSHKOSH - Hundreds of people gathered in downtown Oshkosh on Sunday afternoon to protest police brutality in the United States after last week's death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.Protesters met at the The Sun Dial on Main Street and Algoma Boulevard at about 2 p.m. The crowd began walking Main Street and circled the area four times, stopping in front of the Oshkosh Police Department once.The Black Lives Matter protesters expressed their frustrations, desire for justice and demands for change over megaphones as they walked downtown.They shouted phrases such as "No justice, no peace," "Racist cops have got to go," "I can't breathe" and "Say his name, George Floyd."Floyd was a black man who died on May 25 after being taken into police custody. A bystander's video showed former officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, which angered the public.Protests began in Minneapolis on May 26 and turned violent there and across the country in the following days.The officer was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter of Floyd four days after the death. All four officers present during Floyd's interaction with the police have been fired.To honor Floyd and those who've died during encounters with the police, protesters laid on Jackson Street in front of the police department for eight minutes ⁠— which is how long the police officer pinned Floyd down before his death, according to the bystander video of the incident.FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInPeaceful Black Lives Matter protest takes over downtown Oshkosh FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

"There's probably people who died yesterday that we just don't know. In situations the black man just doesn't have any benefit of the doubt... and that's terrifying."Buy PhotoProtesters gather for a Black Lives Matter march and rally on Sunday, May 31, 2020, in Oshkosh, Wis.

(Photo: Wm. Glasheen/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)The protest was peaceful the entire time despite a small stirrup toward the end.A non-protester tried to incite violence when he approached protesters, a police officer said. Witnesses said the man yelled racial slurs and dismissed Black Lives Matter.More often, the community showed support for the protesters. Residents cheered on from their front porches, handed out water and honored Floyd with sidewalk chalk."I like how we were able to come together and keep it peaceful," protest organizer Imani Ware said. "I like how we had people that were passionate about us being attacked by the people that were observing that weren't for Black Lives Matter, but at least everything stayed positive. Nothing got physical. Oshkosh police were able to do what they needed to do to simmer things down, which is what I highly appreciate."Ware and fellow organizer Madalyn Claudia Thom said they only had interest in protesting by around 120 people before the demonstration. That number was easily doubled and more on Sunday.Buy PhotoOrganizer Imani Ware speaks to protesters during a Black Lives Matter march and rally on Sunday, May 31, 2020, in Oshkosh, Wis.

"It's just beautiful to know that we have people on our side that aren't just black people. We pretty much have everybody coming out and fighting and supporting us."Ben Mueller owns Hempworks Wisconsin on Main Street and noticed the crowd growing throughout the afternoon. He was concerned after seeing businesses damaged and looted across the country during some protests, but he was glad people respected local businesses just as they do the cause of the protest."You don't see the actual good parts (of the protests) that you're seeing right now with this... This is the third time they've passed the store, and the first time was probably half the amount of people," Mueller said.Buy PhotoRylie Blue holds a sign during a Black Lives Matter march and rally on Sunday, May 31, 2020, in Oshkosh, Wis.
