Chanting "No justice, no peace, no racist police," the groups say the issues in Baltimore mirror those faced in San Diego. Protests on the East Coast city turned violent Monday after the funeral for Freddie Gray, a 25-year-old black man who died after suffering mysterious spinal cord injuries in police custody.

"Whether we choose to admit it and choose to deal with it or not, is up to our political leaders," said protester Bryan Kim over shouts of "All night, all day, we will fight for Freddie Gray." "And I think it's pretty clear, from the community behind us, that there's the will to make it happen, he added." Organizers say cities across the country need more police accountability, but some do not agree with taking their grievances too far. They want a peaceful protest, unlike the rioting, burning and looting that has occurred in Baltimore this week. "We have issues here too, and how we can approach that from a solution-based mindset versus a damaging mindset in which we are going out and damaging things in order to prove our point,” said Pastor Shane Harris with National Action Network. He said they can prove their point through silent, peaceful demonstrations, as well as strategizing in community meetings and town halls. In a statement, San Diego Police said their thoughts and prayers are with both the Baltimore officers and the community. "We absolutely support their First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The vast majority of these gatherings are law abiding, peaceful events needing no law enforcement action,” the statement reads. More than 200 people have been arrested in Baltimore as tensions between protesters and police turned into riots, forcing leaders to call in 3,000 police and National Guardsmen. But on Wednesday, demonstrations took on a calmer tone as the city enforced an emergency curfew. Other cities across the country also held solidarity marches, including New York, Washington, D.C., Boston, Minneapolis and Indianapolis. 0 Weather ForecastSan Diego, CA Facebook Twitter Instagram Submit Tips for Investigations Newsletters Contact Us Send Feedback KNSD EMPLOYMENT INFORMATION TERMS OF SERVICE Privacy Policy – New KNSD Public Inspection File Do Not Sell My Personal Information Ad Choices Advertise With Us Careers at NBC 7 Copyright © 2020 NBC Universal Inc.
