We're saying as far as that's concerned, we want justice for David Jones immediately," said Asa Khalif, Black Lives Matter activist.Rendell reacted by saying the protesters had every right to demonstrate."They have the right to say what they want to say. I wouldn't have disrupted a ceremony that was basically for children, but that's their call. But look, if they want to disrupt ceremonies as long as they're in public places, they have the right to do that," Rendell said.After Monday's tense confrontation, the parents and children attending the Franklin Square party were moved inside to a different location.----------Send a breaking news alertReport a correction or typoLearn more about the 6abc apps Related topics:societycenter city philadelphiaphiladelphia newsblack lives matterprotestpolice shootingShare:ShareTweetEmailCopyright © 2020 WPVI-TV.
