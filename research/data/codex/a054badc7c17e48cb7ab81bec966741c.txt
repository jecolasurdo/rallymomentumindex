Neil Johnson SUBSCRIBE NOW Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save JANESVILLEAbout 20 people protested near the entrance to the Rock County Courthouse for much of the business day Tuesday, demanding justice in the case of a Janesville man who was stabbed to death a week earlier.Two days after the stabbing, District Attorney David O'Leary announced he would file no charges against Sarina M. Stone, 20, of Janesville.Stone had admitted stabbing Robert Thomas Jr., 26, police said.O'Leary said in a statement that there was no evidence to prove Stone intended to kill and "more than enough evidence to support a claim of self-defense.” The protest got louder with the addition of a bullhorn in the afternoon, which could be heard inside parts of the courthouse, and an argument developed between protesters and passersby who disagreed with them, said Capt. Jay Wood of the sheriff's office.Wood and deputies moved the protesters from the area in front of the main doors to reduce the disruption and eliminate the possibility that an argument could escalate, Wood said.Protesters appeared angrier afterward, and sheriff's deputies were stationed in the parking lot to keep them away from the entrance.A deputy and a Janesville police officer blocked the parking lot entrances.Wood said the protest was peaceful, and he didn't want to stop the protest, but he needed to ensure people's safety.Some protesters held Black Lives Matter signs, demanded justice and joined in a chant in which they called Stone a murderer.Among the protesters were family members, friends and residents.Carrie Harrell-Payton of Janesville did not know the family, but she came to support them."I don't get it. How can the police do the investigation, give you all the evidence, and you instantly say that this person is going to walk free without anything, no bond, no nothing?” Harrell-Payton said.Harrell-Payton said a racial double standard was applied, because if Thomas had stabbed Stone, "there would be a bond so high right now, nobody would be able to get him out.”Stone got preferential treatment because she is white, said Curtis Sykes, Thomas' older brother."She stabbed him in the heart, and she confessed to it, and she's walking away with no charges?” Sykes said."I want justice. I want the world to know there's still racism and bigotry going on, not just in Janesville but just everywhere. ...”"They can't get away with this,” Sykes said of O'Leary's decision.Sykes said there's evidence of premeditation: Stone tried to stab his brother in downtown Janesville four days before she killed him, and she brought a knife when she went to meet him at his mother's residence.O'Leary said through a spokeswoman that he would not comment Tuesday other than to say he would meet with the family.Janesville police arrested Stone on Aug. 22 on a tentative charge of first-degree reckless homicide.Police Chief Dave Moore said police were aware of a history of violence between the two, but the facts of the case led to a conclusion of reckless homicide.Stone originally said a stranger was involved in the incident but then admitted she stabbed Thomas after being hit in a struggle, Moore said.She never said anything about self-defense, Moore said.Soon after admitting the stabbing, she claimed her right not to speak, Moore said.Police have not released reports of the incident, saying the case remains open because people are still coming forward, and detectives must interview them."We're still conducting those, and anything we have we'll share with the district attorney's office,” Moore said.Sykes complained of a lack of blacks in the local criminal justice system, which is true, and said Janesville is a headquarters of the Ku Klux Klan, which is not true.Moore acknowledged some Klan events were held in Janesville for a short time more than 20 years ago."All the more reason to have a meeting with those concerned and have a sincere and healthy discussion,” Moore added.Members of the Janesville police's African American Liaison Advisory Committee were at the protest and said they had helped set up a meeting between police and the family and with the district attorney's office.Moore said a detective has been keeping the family updated all along but welcomed the meeting.The advisory committee itself also was setting up a separate meeting with police to air concerns, Moore said.The Gazette tried to contact Sarina Stone and her family without success.
