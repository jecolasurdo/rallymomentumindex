Police, in turn, made 200 arrests as the protest stretched into the night. Around 9 p.m., the city sent an emergency notification that it had closed "all highway and street access into and out of downtown.” Protesters overtook a police cruiser near Capitol and Caroline Streets, smashing its windshield and windows. Smoky air filled the area, as officers in SWAT gear attempted to control the crowds. Police radio traffic reported looting in the Verizon store on Main Street. Joe Gamaldi, president of the Houston Police Officers' Association, said some officers were hospitalized after being attacked, though it wasn't immediately clear how many or how seriously they were hurt. Now Playing: A fight erupted at a Black Lives Matter rally at downtown Houston on Friday, May 29, 2020. Video: Jay R Jordan "Our officers who were attacked are in the hospital, patrol cars ruined, businesses damaged, this is not who we are as a city and as a community,” he said. "We will protect your right to protest, but we will not allow our city to decay into chaos.” Related Stories LifestyleBy Joy Sewing, Staff writerHow to talk with your kids about police, race, protestsPoliticsMichael Wines, New York TimesTrump's 'looting' remark dates back to racial unrest of the 1960s The uproar prompted Mayor Sylvester Turner to implore residents to act respectfully. He said most of the protesters "demonstrated their views and their pain” in such a manner. "This is our city. This is our home. Let's not harm one another,” Turner said as the situation escalated Friday night. "I want protesters to go home safely to their families and I want police officers to go home safely to theirs. There is a lot of pain throughout our country.” "So protest? I got it. Demonstrate? March? I got it, you have that right. I only ask that you do it peacefully,” he said. Addressing news media around 6 p.m., Turner said he wasn't aware of any injuries at that time, and he said then that the number of arrests was few, though that was before the situation deteriorated. Some were detained for blocking roads, and others were at scenes where a police cruiser was destroyed. But as the night progressed, rocks and bottles were thrown at officers, skateboards were used to bash patrol car windows, and glass in downtown buildings was shattered. The extent of the damage was unclear. "We are not going to allow looters and people who are intent on causing turmoil in our City. It is one thing to protest against the wrong/the death of #GeorgeFloyd. I join you. But some people are intentionally trying to incite confrontation/violence,” Turner said. "That hurts all of us.” The demonstrations, which remained peaceful for several hours in the afternoon, began with a march organized by Black Lives Matter around 2 p.m. from Discovery Green to City Hall. The throng of protesters, escorted by police down Walker Street, joined national outrage about Floyd's death with chants of "I can't breathe” and "No justice, no peace.” Floyd, 46, a Yates High School graduate, died in Minneapolis police custody Monday night after video showed an officer kneeling on his neck, pinning him to the ground while he pleaded for help. Just before the Houston rally began, officials in Minnesota arrested the officer, Derek Chauvin, and charged him with murder and manslaughter, according to the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. Chauvin and three other officers at the scene were fired earlier this week. Ashton Woods, Black Lives Matter Houston founder, said the rally here was to ensure that "people know that they have a place to come and express their anger and frustration.” While most of the early demonstration was peaceful, that anger and frustration was evident. At one point, a white man with a facial covering, carrying a rifle, was escorted by police from the park outside City Hall. It wasn't clear if he was ultimately arrested. Turner said he didn't have an update on that man. The crowd dispersed from City Hall around 4 p.m., and an organizer told them to leave peacefully, just as they had come in. "Your voices have been heard, but your assignment starts today,” she said, encouraging them to develop strategies for change. The demonstrations grew more disruptive from there, however, leading to several standoffs and clashes with police. On the other side of City Hall, one group had moved to the intersection of Walker and Bagby Streets, climbing on construction equipment and blocking limited traffic. Around 5 p.m., a group of protesters blocked off the Memorial Parkway feeder road near Houston Avenue. That led to a confrontation with mounted police in which at least three people were taken into custody. One of them was pinned to the ground, though it appeared officers stayed clear of his neck and head. Some of the protesters threw items at officers in that altercation, though it wasn't immediately clear what charges — if any — the people taken into custody would face. Later, near Capitol and La Branch, protesters overtook the cruiser. Protesters spilled on to an Interstate 45 ramp and, later, onto U.S. 59. Hordes of police on horses, foot and in cars worked to close roads and secure the areas. Many of the protesters expressed outrage about recent police shootings here in Houston. There have been a string of at least seven such shootings since April, and Chief Art Acevedo has asked the FBI to review one case of a man who appeared to be on his knees at the time he was shot. But Acevedo and Turner have both said the officers in the other cases acted justifiably. They urged residents to review them individually. "What happens sometimes is everything becomes conflated, and viewed through the lens of things that are happening all over the country,” Turner said. Acevedo addressed an angry crowd Friday afternoon, telling them "black lives matter” to his force and yelling into a megaphone: "We stand with the Floyd family.” He emphasized that he had appeared on MSNBC, calling for charges to be filed against the officer in the Floyd case. Some in the crowd said they respected him for addressing the protesters, but others shouted that his remarks weren't satisfactory. "I'm happy that they are here today. People need to be heard,” Acevedo said later. "I'd let them know: Don't let anyone hijack your movement. Because once you start burning a city, nobody's talking about George Floyd. The focus is on people who look like you and me are out of control.” Floyd's death has sparked days of protest and riot in Minneapolis and across the country. Friday's protest here is the first in Houston. There was a prayer vigil Tuesday in Emancipation Park, attended by the mother of Floyd's 6-year-old daughter. "It's cruel — they took him away from my daughter,” Roxie Washington told Chronicle. "She'll never see her father again.” This story is developing and will be continuously updated. Jay R.
