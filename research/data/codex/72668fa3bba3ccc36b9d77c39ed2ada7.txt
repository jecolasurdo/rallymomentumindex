Horacio Peña Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save On Thursday, Sept. 14, evening, students and members of the Lubbock community stood at Tim Cole Memorial Park, holding up signs such as "Stop the hate" and "No more racism" in a public stand against white supremacy and racism.The rally, Stand Against Hate, was organized by Standing on the Side of Love/Lubbock Cares, an organization comprised of various members of the Lubbock community.Daniel Bontempo, a member of the organization, said the rally's purpose was to take a stand against Nazism, white supremacy, hate and oppression. Organization of the protest began 26 days ago, Bontempo said. Francesca di Poppa, an associate professor in the department of philosophy, called a number of people and began putting together the meeting."We formed a media team, a sign-making party, an advanced logistics team," di Poppa said, "but outside of that meeting, all organizing occurred on the event's Facebook page."Di Poppa said people were inspired to host the rally after the Unite the Right rally took place in Charlottesville, Virginia, in early August. The Unite the Right rally ended in violence when a man drove his car into a group of counter protestors, killing one and injuring 19, according to CNBC.Shortly after, di Poppa said she read in the news about a White Lives Matter rally that was planned to take place on Monday, Sept. 11, at Texas A&M University in College Station. The rally was canceled, citing safety concerns."I emailed a bunch of people, friends, colleagues, fellow Unitarians, and I told them that we really need to show these people that lots of Americans don't agree with that," di Poppa said. "We don't think white supremacy, oppression and racism are American values."Di Poppa, holding up a sign of Captain America's shield, said Captain America is a white man who fights against Nazi Germany. Nazi Germany was a dictatorship that oppressed members of the LGBT community, the disabled and Jewish people. The superhero represents the good of the United States, she said, and the values of Nazi Germany are not the values of the United States."We are about democracy," she said. "We're about freedom of speech, freedom of religion, and we are about freedom of opportunity." Two protesters hold up anti-hate signs at Timothy Cole Memorial Park as a part of the Stand Against Hate protest on Thursday, Sept. 14, 2017. Timothy Cole Memorial Park is located on the corner of 19th Street and University Avenue. Horacio Peña Di Poppa, who is an immigrant from Italy, said she came to the United States for graduate school, and she appreciates the values that the United States has."We believe hate, discrimination, racism and white supremacy are not American values," di Poppa said. "I hope people who hear about us and see us will have conversations about what American values are all about."Jimmy Beckett, a sophomore mechanical engineering major from Smithville, said he came to the rally to talk with other demonstrators and understand their points of view.Beckett said he thinks the rally was great, but they were doing it wrong.If everyone kept a positive attitude and judged others based on their characters, then a lot of the negative narratives from the left and the right would disappear, he said."In my opinion, if they really want to make a difference, they should show up to protest a Ku Klux Klan rally," he said. "There's always going to be stupid, hateful people out there, but if you can just ignore them, they can't do anything to you."
