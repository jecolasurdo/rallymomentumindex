The numbers swelled to about 50 once the march began."White supremacy oppresses us all, capitalism oppresses us all, and that is what the NYPD and police all over the country defend," said a protestor going by the initials C.I.Y. "We must stand together and unite. The people's power cannot be stopped.”Various chants were heard during the protest, including "no justice, no peace" and "hands up, don't shoot.” The protestors said the names of Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, and other black people who have died in police incidents.When the protest reconvened at the stationhouse, protestors had the opportunity to speak up individually about their experiences.Drivers passing by, both honked and held up fists in solidarity, and some yelled for the protestors to stop.In one incident, a car stopped traffic and the male driver yelled, "Stop it, stop this,” out the window. Several protestors stepped into the street to confront him before he kept driving and they retreated.Police asked protestors to get off of the street as they followed the group, saying "it's not safe” and "the cars go too fast.”As they began marching, a driver spit into the face of one of the protesters.Some drivers antagonized the protestors by yelling, "f------ losers,” "f--- you guys," and similar expletives.When the protestors arrived back at the stationhouse, a car stopped directly next to them. The driver rolled down his window and yelled at protestors, eventually having a water bottle thrown at his window by a protestor.Before leaving, he caused his car to burnout, leaving the protestors in smoke. The police made no action to stop him or urge him to move on.Jesse Haggerty, a former member of a military police unit and military intelligence, was seen throughout the protest carrying an American flag upside down."Holding the flag like this is a sign of distress,” Haggerty said as he addressed the crowd. "If you can't see that we're under distress, open your eyes.”Haggerty also called for more intense background and psychological screenings on police."We're out here to tear down the racist systems, which are not limited to just the police system,” said L.V., a mother of two who helped to organize Wednesday's protest.L.V. said the protests also attack inequality in education, politics, healthcare systems and more.As the protest came to an end at around 7 p.m., the protestors repeated their core chants before dispersing."We'll be out here every day until we perpetuate change,” L.V. said. "I'm out here for justice for all.”Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
