Artist/photographer Armando Outthere Diaz was out there to capture it all, in photos. "We disturbed the peace for a little while, but only with music, car horns and most importantly, passionate voices speaking to their pain and their love for the neighbors and fellow man,” Diaz writes. Diaz, whose work has been featured at Clerestory Fine Art and is currently on display on South Fullerton Ave., as part of Fresh Air Montclair, says another peaceful protest will take place today (Wednesday) at 3:30pm. "We hope that more of you will make your signs, throw on your masks and join us,” he says. Baristanet Local OffersHome Appliances: SERVICE. PRICE.
