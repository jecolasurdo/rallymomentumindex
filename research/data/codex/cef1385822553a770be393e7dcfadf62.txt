For two hours, the group continued to march, making their way into the Gulch, where they chanted as they called for the termination of Metro Nashville Police Chief Steve Anderson.Before the march, family members of Daniel Hambrick gathered around the playground at Watkins Park to speak."They're going to hear us tonight," said Sam Hambrick, Daniel's cousin. "Officer Andrew Delke will see his day in court ... In the hands of God, man, we're going to see justice."Sam Hambrick noted that the fight "ain't about black and white — by far it's about wrong or right."Dominique Appleton, another cousin of Hambrick's, grieved over there having been no officer to rush to Hambrick's aid in the immediate aftermath of the shooting."Nobody helped him," she said. "They allowed him to lay there like a dead deer on the side of the road."Hambrick, a black man, had ran from his vehicle July 26 in the parking lot of the John Henry Hale Apartments as Delke approached him. Delke, who is white, had attempted to stop the car earlier.Surveillance video of the shooting released Wednesday by the district attorney's office shows Hambrick sprinting away from Delke outside the apartments in a grassy area facing Watkins Park.It doesn't appear that Hambrick was facing Delke when the officer opened fire from a few dozen feet away."None of us, no one here — unless the police are here — could have done what he did," said Joy Kimbrough, an attorney representing the Hambrick who spoke at the rally Saturday. "No one here could have stopped, planted their feet and shot repeatedly when someone a good distance from you is running. I've seen people charged with first-degree murder just for being in the same car."According to Anderson, Delke fired his weapon four times, striking Hambrick three times from behind as he ran away. One of the bullets hit Hambrick in the back of the head."I understand how the public is disturbed," Anderson said after the footage was shared by media. "An officer, from what we've seen on the video, shot someone as they were running away."More:Video shows Daniel Hambrick running from police during fatal shootingMore:NAACP, black clergy call for more police accountability after shooting death of Daniel HambrickRelease of the video prompted outrage from a number of community leaders, some of whom, including Acting Vice Mayor Sheri Weiner, have called for Anderson's resignation.The family of Hambrick, along with Nashville NAACP and Community Oversight Now, a coalition of activists seeking to establish a police review board in Nashville, demanded Delke be charged with murder.District Attorney Glenn Funk has not determined if Delke will face charges.Reach Natalie Allison at nallison@tennessean.com.
