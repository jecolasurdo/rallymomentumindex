Behind her, the flag flew at half staff in Floyd's memory. According to the most recent U.S. Census data, just 1% of Pittsford town residents are black compared to about 90% white. Penfield, 3% black, had a rally last weekend.Hilton, 5% black, has one scheduled for Saturday. Activists in Webster alsoare planning a Saturday rally.Henrietta activists have a Friday event planned as well.A quick scan of Facebook comments on news articles regarding racial justice demonstrates that not everyone is persuaded of the need for systemic change. But even in comparison to the protests following Michael Brown's 2014 death in Ferguson, Missouri, the change in tenor is remarkable."I've been trying to wrap my head around: Why now?" said Julie Weller, a white anti-racism advocate in Greece. "Maybe it's because people are home and forced to watch more stuff in the media. ... Maybe, with the George Floyd video, people have to draw a line in the sand or else acknowledge their racism."Segregated from the beginningWhen large numbers of black people began arriving in waves in Rochester after 1950, the towns of Monroe County began to fill with white families fleeing the city, helped by federally backed loans and newly built highways. White leaders in those towns then acted to put up a fence against black families, including through zoning regulations that remain on the books today.Conor Dwyer Reynolds, a Penfield High School alumnus who is now a clinical lecturer in law at Yale University, has studied the development of zoning codes in Penfield in detail.Before the migration, he said, Penfield and other suburbs welcomed low-income residents. Once race became a factor, he said, "towns like Penfield started using zoning rules to keep affordable housing, apartments, anything but large-lot single-family homes out of their communities.""These zoning ordinances don't say anything about race," he continued. "But if you look at the Town Board meeting minutes and newspaper records and listen to what people were saying, it's clear race was at the forefront of people's minds, trying to keep black people out of the suburbs."While there are now some black residents in every town, and many black residents in some of them, the lasting effect has been that suburban residents are cosseted against issues like police brutality, educational inequality and discrimination in jobs and housing.In the last decade or so, some suburbs have begun a more forthright examination of racism in their midst. Partly in response to several instances of explicit racist graffiti and to complaints of black students and residents, anti-racism groups have formed in several towns, including Pittsford and Brighton.School districts, too, have begun to acknowledge their role to play. A student-led, inter-district group called Roc 2 Change regularly draws hundreds of attendees to all-day events on racism, and most districts have created exploratory committees on curriculum, student discipline and diverse hiring practices, among other things.More:Pittsford racism flare-up sparks families to find their voices in other school districtsA series of well-publicized, racist incidents in Pittsford schools last year led to a series of community forums and pledges of faith from school and community leaders. Superintendent Mike Pero on Wednesday read a statement signed by all local school superintendents promising to "be intentional in rebuilding our education system which has not served underrepresented student populations well."The action points they listed, though, were less sweeping: promoting equity within their own districts; assessing practices and policies; and developing new curricula.Samari Brown, a black student at Pittsford Mendon who co-organized Wednesday's rally, said her school district has much more progress to make."People talk about it, but then it gets swept under the rug again," she said.'Flavor of the week'For those who have been working for racial justice in the area for years, the newfound interest in the suburbs is welcome — if it's authentic."I'm sure for some people it's a flavor of the week," said Duwaine Bascoe, a black lawyer and father who lives in Webster. "(But) it's an American problem, not a black problem, and it's going to be incumbent on all white people to solve it. ... People who are becoming awoken to what allyship actually means need to know that it's not good enough to say you're not a racist. You have to be actively anti-racist."The important point, Bascoe and others said, is to focus not on interpersonal relations but rather on the overarching systems of education, health care, law enforcement and the economy, among others.Fairport Deputy Mayor Matthew Brown acknowledged the same thing in a widely shared Facebook post earlier this week.Referring to possible changes to the village comprehensive plan, he wrote: "We have to take a hard look at our housing and what we are allowing and encouraging to be built in our village and in our town. ... If we are prioritizing 'quaintness' and, I hate to say it, the historical nature of our town over housing availability, then we are very purposely making choices that will keep Fairport white."More:How Rochester's growing city and suburbs excluded black residentsFor white people seeking next steps in fighting racism, Julie Weller suggested creating a reading list, including by the authors Robin DiAngelo and Ibram X. Kendi. "As a white person, you have to take into account it's not the job of black people to educate us," she said. "It's our job to educate ourselves."Anthony Hall, a community organizer in Rochester and former school board candidate, said white suburbanites need to spread the message of anti-racism in their social circles."Make sure that conversation is at the dinner table, and then at the workplace, and then at church, and then in the grocery store," he said. "And then you need to ... physically step foot into the city. It's very important that (people) outside the city understand the disparities black and brown communities face on a daily basis."The most important thing, Hall said, is to keep focused on the problem even after this month."It's time for white America to wake up, take their blinders off and use some of their privilege to eradicate these disparities," he said. "It's time for white America to answer: There's an issue about race in this country, and what are you going to do about it?"Contact staff writer Justin Murphy at jmurphy7@gannett.com.
