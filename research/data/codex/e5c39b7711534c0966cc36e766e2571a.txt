Bissell Park. The protest was one of many across Tennessee that stem from the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis after an officer knelt on his neck.But this rally had a twist — the speakers included Oak Ridge Police Chief Robin Smith; Oak Ridge Mayor Warren Gooch; City Council member Derrick Hammond, who also serves as pastor at Oak Valley Baptist Church; Oak Ridge Board of Education member Ben Stephens; teacher and assistant Oak Ridge High School Wildcats football coach Kwayu Graham; Oak Ridge Police Department detective Marvell Moore; the Rev. David Allred of High Places Community Church; former Oak Ridge High School coach Don Colquitt; the Rev. Jake Morrill of Oak Ridge Unitarian Universalist Church; and the Rev. Mark Flynn of First United Methodist Church in Oak Ridge."Today's event is about bringing the community together,” said rally organizer Trevor King. "If you are open to have a conversation, then you are doing your part."This is not a political event. This is a human event. Maybe Donald Trump should learn that. This is not political. It's human,” he told The Oak Ridger.A small group of counter protesters, one carrying a sign reading "White safety matters,” made their presence known. "A lot of people seem to think it's weird that we're here,” police chief Smith told reporters. "We're part of the community. We're not on an opposite side of the community.” Listening and having conversations together were the themes in Smith's comments to the crowd: "Tell us what's on your mind. We can always look to ways to improve how we do our job, improve the way we provide service to our citizens."Signs at the event referenced not just Floyd, but also Ahmaud Aubrey and Breonna Taylor, whose deaths have become flashpoints around the country. Inspiring moments were balanced with sharp criticism. "I'm tired of somebody getting offended when we say that black lives matter,” former coach Colquitt said. "We know that all lives matter, but it seems that our black lives don't.”"I think we are blessed to have a police force in Oak Ridge that cares about black lives,” Pastor Flynn said in an interview.Graham, in his speech, asserted that the department has room for improvement."See, Oak Ridge, despite the job that you're trying to do, even you have skeletons in your closet,” he said to applause after mentioning the name Eugene Rod Harris. Oak Ridge police officers killed Harris in 2010.
