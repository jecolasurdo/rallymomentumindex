Ava-joye Burnett has more. They gathered around 6 p.m. Friday at McKeldin Square at Light and East Pratt streets. They marched up Pratt and then turned and rallied in front of the police headquarters. After a brief rally, they marched to the Light Street Pavilion. Protesters are blocking traffic on Light Street, walking in between the cars. Then, shortly after 9 p.m., they held a sit-in at Pratt and Light. The crowd dispersed before 11 p.m. It is a peaceful protest but there are reports that four people been arrested. Police say those four people were asked to move from the road and refused. "Justice is supposed to be for all,” one woman said. Police estimate 200 people protested Friday evening. Organizers told WJZ it was a justice event for Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. Both men were shot and killed by police officers earlier this week. "Every time an officer kills somebody, they never get arrested, they don't get no time and that off. So what is that saying to the people? An officer has the right to kill somebody and get freed, but if we kill somebody, we go to jail. You're sending two different messages,” one woman said. "It's horrifying and not only are we all complacent, but all cops are complacent, too,” said another woman. That woman was one of those arrested. In a statement released earlier Friday, Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis said: "Protests are scheduled in Baltimore for today. As we have done throughout the past year, we will work to protect protestors' 1st amendment rights. The safety of our officers and protestors is paramount. It is up to all of us, collectively, to ensure a safe atmosphere. It is more important now than ever that we promote open lines of communication as work together for the greater good.” Again, the protest was peaceful.
