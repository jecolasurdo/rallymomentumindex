"I absolutely was being disruptive, but as I was making statements I felt hands grabbing on me."Austin said he was placed in police custody outside of the rally, but was not arrested."What concerns me is that people were yelling racial epithets and hateful things," Austin said, referring specifically to the person in the crowd who called for him to be lit on fire. "I heard the n-word a couple of times.""If we really want to make America great again, then we have to come together," Austin added. "We have to promote a positive agenda that's not going to exclude or promote racial hate towards anyone."Other protesters who were with Austin were also removed from the rally by security.
