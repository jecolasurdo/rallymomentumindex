Mario M. Cuomo Bridge. EDITORIAL: We champion the organizers' right to free expression, but safety must come firstTRENDING UP: Activism growing in Hudson Valley"People tell me that we brought attention, but I feel like such a failure to my people for not getting across the bridge,” Green said, holding back tears."It's OK,” said co-organizer Tonia Conner. "They heard us.”Green nodded."Well, you know, we didn't get across, but I know that there are a lot of other bridges in New York that we will. So it doesn't end here," she said. Saturday's march, organized by 100Sistas and Black Lives Matter Hudson Valley, was declared an "unlawful assembly," by state police. In a statement, police said they "strongly support the rights of any group to peacefully march and express their freedom of speech."But, police said, the proposed march across the bridge posed a threat to marchers' safety. Still under construction, the bridge's bike and pedestrian paths are not open, and police said anyone who attempted to cross would be arrested. "The Mario M. Cuomo Bridge carries an interstate highway with heavy traffic volumes traveling at high speeds, and also remains an active construction zone," said the police statement. "This type of event presents significant safety issues for the marchers, drivers and members of law enforcement." Around 10:30 a.m., police officers outnumbered marchers — who held signs, a tuba, trumpet and drums and who were gathered in the parking lot of the CVS on South Broadway. Overcast skies and gusty winds brought the temperatures down, and most marchers were bundled in their jackets and hats.Alicia Murphy-Wartell of Croton-on-Hudson was one of the first to arrive. Together with her two young children and her friend, she said she explained the significance of the march to her kids on the drive over. "As a white person, we are here to support our black community members," she said. "I told my son that it's important to stand up for people who are treated unfairly.” By 11 a.m., nearly 100 people from Ulster, Dutchess and Westchester counties came out. On the march's Facebook event, over 500 people said they were interested in attending, while 200 said they were going.Organizers set up a gofundme to pay for bail and help people with disabilities march. Nearly $6,000 was donated.In the moments before the march, it was unclear if anyone would try to cross the bridge. Marchers were reportedly facing "mass arrests" if anyone did. Green said there were marchers who were prepared to be the first to cross and get arrested. They never made it that far.Following the rally, marchers stepped onto a closed-off Route 119 and headed for Exit 9. They were met by dozens of state, county and Tarrytown police who, together with police cruisers and county plow trucks, blocked the off-ramp."Look at all the police presence," said marcher Ali Muhammad. "They are ready to arrest people, and they could have made this happen,” he said referring to the success of the march.Many protesters squared off with police officers at the barricade and chanted "Cuomo's Selma." Others shot video on their cellphones. Slowly, the crowd inched forward until marchers and officers began shoving one another.No arrests or injuries were reported. Roughly an hour after the march began, organizers announced that they were headed back to the CVS. There, they played music and sang. Green said protesters were driving to Nyack for the second half of the rally. Around 3:30 p.m., about 100 protesters gathered in front of Nyack Public Library and marched to Memorial Park, chanting, "The people united will never be defeated" and holding signs saying, "Black lives matter." "No more business as usual," Green said. Although the Black Women's March never did achieve its goal of crossing the bridge, some marchers called the protest a success."I feel like it was a very effective, informal, unofficial march that people who are concerned about equal rights and institutional racism, came out to participate in," said Patricia O'Keefe of New Rochelle. "Enough police came out today, and enough press came out today, that we did manage to get people's attention. But did they understand the reason? Will people reflect on the reason why all these police and press came out?"Following the march, state police issued another statement. "The state previously communicated to the event organizer that the bridge is an active construction zone and highway and that to ensure the safety of event participants and drivers, foot traffic of any kind is prohibited," the statement reads.According to the release, police offered several alternatives to crossing the bridge on foot, including other bridges and roads."We are glad today's event was peaceful and respectful,” it read.Twitter: @nl_tantilloStaff writers Matt Coyne and Christopher Eberhart contributed to this report.Staff Directory Corrections Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Public Notices Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My AccountSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJob Network Cars.com White Plains Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2020 www.lohud.com.
