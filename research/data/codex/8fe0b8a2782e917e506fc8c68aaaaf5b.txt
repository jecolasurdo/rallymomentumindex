Among them, activist Iris Roley, who was in court; Joe Mallory, first vice president of the Cincinnati chapter of the NAACP; Rev. Damon Lynch III; Pastor Lesley Jones; and Ohio state Sen. Cecil Thomas."In court today, Judge Dinkelacker, many of the comments he made, made it seem very personal. He showed he was being vindictive when he decided to lock her up," Mallory said. "So, since he wanted to make it personal when he read all these postcards... he mentioned all the things that offended him... him receiving postcards at home... we decided to just go to his home so he could really see how we really feel about this unjust decision.”Pastor Lesley Jones, center, holds a sign while protesting with others outside the home of Judge Patrick T.
