Emotions raw during Birmingham's Black Lives Matter protest - al.com Skip to ArticleBirmingham Real-Time NewsEmotions raw during Birmingham's Black Lives Matter protestUpdated Mar 07, 2019; Posted Jul 09, 2016 Black Lives Matter Protest in Birmingham, AlabamaBy Jonece Starr Dunigan | jdunigan@al.com In the same place where blacks were attacked by dogs and sprayed with fire hoses half a century ago, several hundred people battled conflicting emotions during a protest at Kelly Ingram Park in Birmingham on Friday.Community leaders coordinated the Black Lives Matter rally in response to the two officer involved-shooting deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile. Cullman resident Denise Bolden-Little grappled with fear, disappointment, confusion and rage when she heard the two black males were killed by police officers.She said it felt like her obligation as a mother and a military service member to take the trip to Birmingham and join the rally. She served in the Marine Corp for six years, she said."It just dawned on me. My death is more valuable than my life," Bolden-Little said. "That makes me sad because I love this country. I just wish it felt the same about me."Before protesters marched from the park to the steps of Birmingham Police headquarters on First Avenue North, community leaders, politicians and residents spoke for nearly two hours in front of a crowd bearing signs that declared an end to the violence. Some of them encouraged the younger generation to foster change the same way their parents and grandparents did during the Civil Rights Movement.Birmingham City Council Member Johnathan Austin said he also has become a victim of discrimination, but his message was rooted in unity."The only way we can turn this thing around is if we hold hands here together in solidarity for a change," Austin said. "Enough is enough."Attitudes towards law enforcement was mostly positive. Birmingham Police Chief A. C. Roper was welcomed with applause when he arrived. During his speech, he reminded residents about the five officers who died and the seven who were wounded in a shooting during a protest in Dallas on Thursday night. He thanked the men and women who were still working 911 calls during the event.Roper said he cried when he saw the violence in Minneapolis and Louisiana and spoke about changes in the police department."As we look at policing across this nation, we have some challenges," Roper said. "There are some chiefs out there who understand it...and we are working hard to try to fix it. Here in Birmingham, we are doing some things, some training, you might not be aware of because we know we have to do better. Our communities deserve it."The mood intensified as residents talked about their encounters with officers. People shouted about their mistrust in law enforcement. Community activist Frank Matthews cried as he talked about Castile getting shot in front of his child before he dropped the microphone."We've been saying, 'No justice. No peace.' for 10 years and we still ain't got nothing yet," Matthews said. "I don't want to hear it no more."Birmingham resident Makobe Tabengwa felt the same emotions when he heard about the shootings. He said the sense shock led to numbness. Then the numbness festered into rage. The rage stirred into a need to protest with a sign that read, "Unarmed Black Man""As a black man, I feel like my skin color is seen as a threat. It is seen as a weapon," Tabengwa said. "I thought that by having this sign, I'm saying, 'I'm not armed. I'm not carrying a weapon. My skin color is not itself a weapon.'"Participants went to the streets shouting the famous chants associated with the Black Lives Matter movement nearly two hours after the event started at 5 p.m. Many recorded the march on their cell phones while pounding their fists in the air."Hands up. Don't Shoot.""Say their names.""There is no justice, but we will seek peace."Many participants had signs that spoke louder than their words. Black males held signs asking if they were the next hashtag on social media. Birmingham resident Romel Williams, her two daughter and their friend wore shirts with the words "Will I be next?"Romel Williams said she became emotional when community activist Carlos Montez Chaverst Jr. did a roll call of black individuals who were killed by police officers. Participants' voices echoed through the streets as the crowd repeated every name after him."I realized how many lives have been lost," Romel Williams said. "I'm scared of the lives of my girls."Non-black participants shouted black lives matter when organizers recognized them for coming to the event. The protest ended peacefully with a prayer.Vallerie Paulin, who is white, said the realities of police brutality knocked on her family's door after Trayvon Martin was shot and killed by George Zimmerman, a neighborhood watch volunteer, in 2012. Her 17-year-old foster brother is black.With the Dallas shooting still haunting the back of her mind, Paulin was late to the event because she had to assign someone to take care of her dogs just in case she did die from sudden violence.She said she couldn't let her fear stop her from leaving a legacy of love."Black lives do matter. They are important," she said. "We can't be considered one, we cannot be considered equal, until everyone realizes that there is a problem."Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).Â© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
