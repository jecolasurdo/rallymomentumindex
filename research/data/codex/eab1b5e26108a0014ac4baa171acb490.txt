LAPD estimated about 20,000 people were in attendance, making it one of the biggest protests in the L.A. area over the past few days. The protest was sponsored by Black Lives Matter, BLD PWR and local rapper YG, and was attended by people of various races and ages. Widespread demonstrations came after the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, who died shortly after an officer held his knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. For complete coverage of the situation in Minneapolis visit CBSMinnesota.com and stream CBSN Minnesota. Marchers in Hollywood were still moving as of 7 p.m. and most appeared to be wearing face masks, although they were still standing closely together. Police presence was low in the area, so some people volunteered to direct traffic as others marched, chanted and handed out water to the protesters braving the heat. The group was considerably smaller after 10 p.m. as some demonstrators gathered around a makeshift memorial.

Mayor Eric Garcetti announced.

Reply Captain 2020 says: June 8, 2020 at 3:42 pm They're gonna march down to Electric Avenue. And then they'll take it higher. Reply Ed Advanc says: June 11, 2020 at 2:21 pm Look around people – This is a prime example of the fact that America does NOT have a racist bone left in her body. No self-acknowledged racist would ever stand around an let this happen. So many targets of opportunity and nothing happens. All we have to figure out now is how to get people to acknowledge that ALL lives matter, no one race above the other, and we will have a true utopia.
