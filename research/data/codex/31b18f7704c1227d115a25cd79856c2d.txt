WatchWorkforce AllianceYale EventsYMCAYouth ContinuumSubscribe to the NHI Newsletter Protesters Storm PD Seeking Answers In Officer-Involved Shooting; Officials Mumby Thomas Breen | Apr 16, 2019 11:26 pm (17) Comments | Commenting has been closed | E-mail the AuthorPosted to: Hamden, Legal Writes, Dixwell Hundreds of protesters massed up and down Dixwell Avenue in two separate rallies late Tuesday demanding answers about why a young woman was shot and a young man arrested (then released) in New Haven by Hamden police earlier in the day.Officials refused to offer any, down to otherwise routinely disclosed details.Hamden's acting police chief, deputy police chief, and mayor all told the upset crowds that they could share virtually nothing about the incident, which is being investigated by the state attorney's office.Tuesday's rapidly organized outpourings of community grief over the shooting of 22-year-old Stephanie Washington and the arrest of 21-year-old Paul Witherspoon took place over the course of two large gatherings at either end of Dixwell Avenue: one in the late afternoon outside the Hamden Police headquarters at 2900 Dixwell, one in the early evening at the corner of Dixwell and Argyle Street in New Haven, where Hamden and Yale police shot at the two young people in the early hours of Tuesday morning. Both rallies brought out well over 150 people, who chanted, shouted, and wept as they demanded that Hamden police immediately release body camera footage from Tuesday morning's shooting, fire the officers involved, and start treating the African American communities they police like neighbors, not like animals.Speakers at both rallies continually referenced video recordings of the shootings that have already leaked, and that seem to show a Hamden officer running out of his police car and firing multiple rounds into a parked Honda Civic whose occupant obeyed an order to come out, then ducked back in when bullets started flying, including some fired by a back-up cop from Yale's police force.One bullet struck the torso of Stephanie Washington, who was in the passenger seat; she was subsequently taken to the hospital for surgery. Hamden police allegedly crossed the town line into New Haven to find the car based on a report of a possible attempted robbery. No weapons were reportedly found in the car, nor any evidence reported of anyone involved disobeying the cops. (Click here for an interview with driver Witherspoon by WTNH's Mario Boone.) "Police officers should not be held to different standards than civilians,” anti-police brutality activist Kerry Ellington said at both the Hamden and the New Haven rallies. "We all saw the footage today.”And yet, Hamden Acting Police Chief John Cappiello, Hamden Deputy Police Chief Bo Kicak, and Hamden Mayor Curt Leng all told the protesters that, because the state attorney's office is investigating the case, they cannot release the body camera footage or any other details about what might have happened Tuesday morning. They did confirm that the officer involved has been put on administrative duty.Click here to read the official initial version of the shooting and some of the ways that official version started fraying during the day, culminating with the release of the suspect/shooting target.The evening protest's crowd had to wait until Witherspoon's mother took the microphone to know that Witherspoon had been released from police custody, and hadn't been charged with any crimes.Hamden Takes Extreme Stand One local attorney, Norm Pattis, told the Independent that, while police are entitled to keep body camera footage private during a state investigation of an officer-involved shooting that leads to a fatality, he is not so sure that that holds true for shootings where the victims are not killed.Police have discretion. Local police have taken varying approaches to how much information to release about events under investigation. Hamden is so far taking a position on one extreme of the spectrum.A state trooper, for instance, did provide some details of the official version Tuesday afternoon, while Hamden officials have refused even to offer names of people involved or charges originally considered.In New Haven, police officials have weighed what evidence needs to be withheld in ongoing investigations in order not to prejudice interviews, while sometimes seeking to release as much other information as quickly as possible in order to quell rumors and gain public trust.For instance, they waited a few days to release body camera footage about a controversial tasing of a suspect in a bodega to protect the integrity of certain parts of the investigation, then promptly made the video available to address public concerns and in the spirit of the body cam program's original stated purpose.In an officer-involved shooting in Fair Haven, even though state police immediately took over the investigation, local top cops were able to provide some basic details to address public concerns without jeopardizing evidence collection.In Tuesday's Hamden case, officials there took the complete no-information route, refusing to release even names and ages or the status or details of the arrest, leaving it up to social media to fill in details that proved in some cases accurate, in others not.Storming HQ The Hamden rally began at around 5:30, as organized by a coalition of local police-accountability groups, including People Against Police Brutality, Black Lives Matter New Haven, the Party for Socialism and Liberation, Justice for Jayson, and the Connecticut Bail Fund.Barbara Fair, Remidy Shareef, and Norm Clement joined Washington's friends at the early stages of the protest outside of the Hamden Police headquarters at 2900 Dixwell Ave. to wave signs and shout with tears rolling down their cheeks about the injustice of Hamden police shooting Washington multiple times. "What they need to understand is that this is not a Hamden, Connecticut problem,” Shareef said. "Or a New Haven problem. This is an American cultural problem. This isn't just about Hamden, or New Haven, or wherever. They're killing us everywhere. And the bullshit's got to stop."I'm saying this as a black man. I'm tired of seeing our babies, our mothers, our women dying because they're not protected by the police force or by the men in their community. So now this got to be taken to a whole nother level. Because if my kids can't be safe, then ain't nobody gonna be safe.” Fair agreed. She said that these types of rallies, this type of outrage, shouldn't happen in response just to one shooting, and it shouldn't happen just in the streets. This level of outrage has to be maintained day in, day out, she said, in order for systemic change to happen. And it needs to be brought into places of power. Like the police headquarters itself.Which is exactly what the crowd decided to do. Led by Shareef and Fair, over 100 people flooded the atrium of the police department's headquarters, demanding to talk with the chief or the highest ranking officer on duty.After 20 minutes of shouting chanting and stilted conversation with officers between a thick pane of glass, Kicak came out to talk with the protesters.But, besides meeting the protesters face to face, the Hamden deputy police chief shared little with the group."Obviously, one of our officers was involved in an unfortunate incident,” he said. "I cannot go into the details as to what transpired. An individual was unfortunately shot.”"Stephanie Washington!” someone shouted from the crowd."I do not know the young lady,” he said. "The Connecticut state police are at this time conducting a thorough and independent investigation. I do not have the authority to give any specifics as to what transpired. If anybody's looking for any specifics, you will have to turn to them.”Fair pushed Kicek to put pressure on the state investigators to complete their review expeditiously, so that a hurting community can understand what exactly happened Tuesday morning."I will do everything that I can,” he said.Back To The Scene Hungry for answers, the protesters received little more news on what transpired early Tuesday when the rally moved at around 7 p.m. down to Dixwell Avenue and Argyle Street, just outside of where the shooting had taken place roughly 13 hours before. Acting New Haven Police Chief Otoniel Reyes confirmed that New Haven police officers were not involved with Tuesday morning's shooting."I want to commend the leadership of the Hamden Police Dept because they're not hiding in an office,” Reyes said. "They're here. They're here to show face for what happened today. and that's all we can ask of our leadership. Is that correct?”"No!” members of the crowd shouted back.By the time the crowd had quieted down, Reyes continued."Today we had a shooting in our streets,” he said. "There was an incident that happened in Hamden, and it played out, and it ended here. Out of respect to the investigation, I want to refrain from giving too many details."At the end of the day, I'm not here to convince you of anything other than what you may have seen in that video. But what I'm asking you to do, and I'm asking every member of this community, is to understand that we have an opportunity to shape the narrative here. And we have a responsibility to our young people in this community to go about justice in the right way. We're going to make sure that this is a transparent investigation. We're gonna make sure that people are held accountable if they did something that's inconsistent with the expectations. That's all we can promise you.” Hamden Mayor Curt Leng had little more to share."I'm angry too,” the Hamden mayor said. "We're all angry. And I can't ask you to believe me that we're gonna do the right thing. And i understand that. I ask one thing. I ask you to believe in the actions that are taken. One of the things that's very difficult about being mayor, about being a police chief, about being a leader in some of the government entities is that when investigations happen, we're not allowed to talk about things, because if we talk about them, we taint the investigation.”Hamden Acting Chief Cappiello said the first thing he did upon hearing of the shooting was call the New Haven State's Attorney Patrick Griffin and ask him to conduct a thorough, independent investigation of what had happened."Once that happens,” he said, "we lose control of the investigation.” And the body camera footage, the cop car footage, the officer's equipment and all other potential evidence become the temporary property of the state attorney's office."At this point in time,” he said, "I can just put the officer on administrative leave.” Which he did.

I'm just curious.posted by: publikskooled on April 17, 2019 8:45amnothing good happens at 4:30 amposted by: wendy1 on April 17, 2019 8:47amJames Baldwin and others predicted that the Americans would come to sow what they reaped; violence, injustice, shame, poverty, upheaval.posted by: matt325c on April 17, 2019 9:48amWhy don't people let the investigation take place before we presume the officer is guilty and should be fired/prosecuted? I dont see how blocking streets and storming the police station helps the situation.posted by: mspepper on April 17, 2019 10:26amDoes anyone know if there is a protest on the green planned for Saturday or Sunday?posted by: cunningham on April 17, 2019 11:34ammatt325c, did you see the effing video?posted by: challenge on April 17, 2019 1:36pm@matt325c: Rarely will those not impacted by a terrible incident understand the actions of those who are. I repeat cunningham's question? Also note Kicak came from behind the glass only after a request was made to do so. It was not a spontaneous move on his part. There were officers who sat their expressionless and others who actually smirked during the demands to speak to someone of authority. I Their indifference spoke volumes.posted by: matt325c on April 17, 2019 4:04pmYes, i saw a video of the incident. It doesnt show what the people in the car were doing or what the officers saw. I guess the concept of innocent until proven guilty doesnt apply to cops and you can judge guilt on a video which doesnt show the whole incident?Remember back in 2014 when the lie of "hands up don't shoot” was spread around, and "activists” and the media villified a cop who was innocent? Maybe we should try to avoid that and let the investigators do their jobs.posted by: wendy1 on April 18, 2019 10:45amBad timing all around. I feel sorry for the cops and the victims.posted by: challenge on April 18, 2019 12:45pmMatt325: It must be nice and comfy to see the world through the lens you wear. First of all there are several videos while you speak of one. There is clear evidence of cops gone wild. Way too much to claim innocence. By the way those in my community once arrested are guilty until there is undeniable evidence of their innocence . That's because SOME have the luxury of blindly trust in police regardless of how many times we uncover corruption and lies. I would love to hear about the part of 2014 "hands up, don't shoot” led you to believe the cop was innocent? He was guilty as sin which is why the department quickly got rid of him . He was an arrogant, racist, coward in blue. He was only innocent in the eyes of those who chose to see it that way..posted by: matt325c on April 18, 2019 6:59pmChallenger:You don't know the lens I see the world through. You apparently don't want all the evidence, such as body cams, dash cams, and witness statements to be taken into consideration prior to your proclamation that the cops are guilty. You don't think people in your community are given denied the presumption of innocence so you want to deny the presumption of innocence to others?And FYI, Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson resigned from the police force in Ferguson, he wasn't "quickly gotten rid of”. He resigned because the community was rioting and burning the city down. He was also justified in Shooting Mike Brown, who assaulted him and tried to take his gun. Wilson is only guilty in the eyes of people who willfully ignore the facts to suit their agendaposted by: challenge on April 19, 2019 1:13pmMatt I will say one final thing and I'm done. America is the way it is because of people like you who choose what to see and hear. Officers choose to resign to avoid being fired so fire, resign it's all relative. It's about the department ridding itself of liability. Happens all the time so they can secure their pension. With several videos made already the public doesn't need dash cam to provide guilt. All it can do is provide a few more details yet to arrest these officers there is overwhelming evidence already to do so. Either you haven't see the evidence or you are intentionally adjusting your lens to dismiss facts already in evidence. Whatever the case it's your choice yet the rest of us have all the evidence we need to march, protest and make demands for justice.Happy Easter.posted by: Barking up the right tree on April 20, 2019 12:32pmAttorney General Eric Holder (the only AG found in contempt of Congress) did everything he could to prove the police officer was guilty of a crime in Ferguson. He used the full weight of the DOJ to prove the cop was guilty. The problem was that multiple black witnesses testified that the cop was innocent. A tragic situation no doubt. Please learn the facts of the case before distorting falsehoods to cause more racial division in our community. If a disgraced leftist radical like Holder couldn't find evidence of a crime then it didn't happen.posted by: challenge on April 21, 2019 10:05amTree, First it's difficult to believe Congress did ANYTHING but IF Holder was held in contempt it was likely because he was doing his job, fighting against white supremacy in government. You say "Black witnesses” exonerated the killer. Thanks for the humor. IF that was even said it had to come from FOX News. Black voices witnessed the height of racism in Missouri government which is why most have since resigned. Just laughable but carry on. Lolposted by: Barking up the right tree on April 21, 2019 2:52pmChallenge : I'm sorry you don't know your history or you would know that Holder is the only AG in history of our country to be in contempt of Congress. It's common knowledge. Read up on Ferguson case to find indisputable facts that Black witnesses testified that Brown was the instigator and the cop was falsely accused. Their testimony is public knowledge and easy to find. Disgraced Holder did his best to jail the cop but all the evidence pointed towards complete exoneration of the police officer. Try sticking to facts because your opinions don't matter in a court of law. In fact your opinions seem to be based on skin color rather than facts. Reviewing the definition of racism in any dictionary might give you pause before you expose yourself to the world. A self exam may be beneficial. to your world view.
