But earlier, thousands gathered peacefully outside the US embassy for a second straight day of protests against racial injustice.London-based student Darcy Bourne says she thinks everyone knows the protest is about more than just Floyd, but about racism around the world.Another student, Steffi Cox, says racism is a global issue and that people need to "come together and make sure everyone is educated.”Meanwhile, in Bristol, about 177 kilometres west of London, protesters on Sunday celebrated as they toppled a statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston. It was then dragged rolled through the streets before being dumped in the River Avon.Saturday clashes condemnedUK authorities tried to discourage protests amid current lockdown measures that ban gatherings of more than six people.The country's most senior police chief said 14 officers were injured on Saturday during clashes with protesters in central London that followed a largely peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstration attended by tens of thousands.Cressida Dick, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, said the assaults on officers were "shocking and completely unacceptable.” She said a number of arrests have been made and "justice will follow.” The clashes broke out in the early evening near the office of Prime Minister Boris Johnson.Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, says violence is "simply not acceptable” and has urged those protesting to do so lawfully while also maintaining social distancing.Twelve people have been arrested with the majority of the arrests made for public order offences. One was for criminal damage, the Metropolitan Police has said.Germany and France saw clashes too on Saturday.In Berlin, police said 93 people were detained in connection with a demonstration attended by about 15,000 people in the German capital.Police said several officers and one press photographer were injured after bottles and rocks were thrown from the crowd, which had gathered despite police orders to clear the city's Alexander Square.In Marseille, France, police fired tear gas and pepper spray in skirmishes with protesters who hurled bottles and rocks after what had been an emotional yet peaceful demonstration.Around 23,000 people joined protests across France on Saturday. This week's protests followed those of June 2, when thousands marched for George Floyd and Adama Traoré in Paris.Traoré's family has been calling for justice in the case of the death of 24-year-old Adama Traoré since 2016.Share this articleCopy/paste the article video embed link below:CopyShareTweetSharesendShareTweetSharesendMoreHideShareSendShareShareShareSendShareShareYou might also like Bristol statue toppling: Who was Edward Colston and why did anti-racism protesters target him?
