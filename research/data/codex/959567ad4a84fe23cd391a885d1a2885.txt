All was peaceful. (Photo by Cindy Yamanaka/The Press Enterprise) By Brian Rokos | brokos@scng.com | The Press-EnterprisePUBLISHED: June 6, 2020 at 7:40 a.m. | UPDATED: June 6, 2020 at 7:44 a.m.A Yucaipa city councilman has defended the business owners who took up arms out of concern, he said, that looters would piggyback off of peaceful protests in the city. The sight of the weapons unnerved some Yucaipa residents, including a black woman, Michele Wilson, who said she feared for the safety of her sons so much that she met with a San Bernardino County sheriff's captain during a Yucaipa Boulevard protest on Tuesday, June 2, of George Floyd's death while in Minneapolis police custody. Councilman Bobby Duncan said Wednesday that business owners had become aware of a Facebook post that suggested that looters shift their focus from San Bernardino to Redlands and Yucaipa. Then, images posted on social media showed men on rooftops and in front of Yucaipa businesses on Monday night. "The nonsense that we are a bunch of racists is the stupidest thing I've ever heard of. We're just middle-class people,” Yucaipa City Councilman Bobby Duncan said in an interview on June 3, 2020. (File photo by Cindy Yamanaka, The Press-Enterprise/SCNG) "Business owners armed themselves to make sure their businesses were not torched and burned. It's perfectly legal,” Duncan said. The Sheriff's Department on Tuesday afternoon said that in response to concerns, it reminded business owners that while the law allows them to have a firearm to protect the business, there are laws against concealed weapons and carrying them in public. It was unclear this week whether any business owner was under investigation. "The Yucaipa station is continuing to investigate the events that occurred Monday evening. Unfortunately, we can't discuss specific persons related to any investigations as they are ongoing at this time,” sheriff's spokeswoman Jodi Miller said. Tensions have been high in the city. On Monday, protesters and counter-protesters shouted at each other across Yucaipa Boulevard, and they later fought at an ARCO gas station. Deputies found two combatants who both refused to press charges, the Sheriff's Department said. us at (909) 918-2305.The Yucaipa Police Department and the @CityofYucaipa will continue working together to provide quality service to our community, through communication with residents from all walks of life. pic.twitter.com/BbPuppLZ1g — Yucaipa Police (@YucaipaPD) June 3, 2020 During Tuesday's demonstration against racial and social injustice, a group of mostly white men stood watching the protesters. Twice the men formed a line in the parking lot but did not attempt to block anyone. One person held an American flag and another held a Trump 2020 banner. One of the men said they were there to "protect” Yucaipa. "This is probably the reddest city in Southern California,” Duncan said when asked about the men. Rep. Pete Aguilar, D-Redlands, said Wednesday he was angry about the number of black people who have died at the hands of law enforcement and that protesters' voices need to be heard. "For those reasons, I'm deeply distressed by the images I have seen from Upland and Yucaipa this week,” Aguilar said, noting that a man was charged with assault with a deadly weapon after authorities said he wielded a rifle at protesters in Upland. "Any attempt to harass, intimidate or attack those protesters is unacceptable. Glorifying violence, fighting protesters and brandishing firearms are not solutions to our local or national problems.” Aguilar added: "It's deeply disturbing that elected officials in Yucaipa feel compelled to open carry at public establishments and in public view ... We must also condemn attempts to intimidate protesters and perpetuate the same power structures of systemic racism that have led us to this moment.” An Aguilar spokesman said the Congressman's comment about armed elected officials was a reference to Duncan. The councilman acknowledged that he was the person in a photo circulated on social media that showed someone sitting in a chair, talking on a cell phone with a rifle propped up next to him on a wall in front of a business. Duncan said the rifle was not his. "The nonsense that we are a bunch of racists is the stupidest thing I've ever heard of. We're just middle-class people,” Duncan said. Duncan was criticized in 2019 for comments on his personal Facebook page that attacked Muslims and undocumented Latino immigrants. He later said that he would be more cautious about what he posted.
