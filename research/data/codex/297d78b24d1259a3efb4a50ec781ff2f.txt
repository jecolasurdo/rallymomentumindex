The two men pursued Arbery in a truck because they believed him to be a suspect behind burglaries in the neighborhood. Demonstrators are also calling for Jackie Johnson, the District Attorney of the Brunswick Judicial Circuit, to be replaced. Johnson recused her office in the investigation as Gregory McMichael was a former investigator in her office.
