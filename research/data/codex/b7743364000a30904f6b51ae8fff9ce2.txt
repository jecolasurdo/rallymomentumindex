We are ONE student body despite skin color & we will stand for what is right ! #ARCHERunited,” she wrote.Another student wrote on social media that some rumors about the week's events were not true, and the students should be united and represent the school, a message the student heard from Principal Ken Johnson."We seriously shouldn't be giving our school a bad name because that's not what Archer is about,” the student wrote. "He knows what happened is wrong and he said that he is doing something about it. So stop spreading irrelevant things on social media that aren't even true.”Gwinnett County Public Schools spokesman Bernard Watson said there weren't any incidents at the school on Friday morning."I think today we got back to the business of learning,” Watson said. "When the kids came in, everything went smoothly and went back to class. The principal's spoken through his letter to the parents and the students. Clearly we're all about learning and that's what we're trying to get the focus back on.” Support Local JournalismNow, more than ever, the world needs trustworthy reporting—but good journalism isn't free.
