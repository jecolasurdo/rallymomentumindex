The gathering on the grass at North Maple and Linwood avenues, in front of flags flying at half-staff, was small compared with rallies in Paterson, Clifton and Newark.But by the time Raven Powell took the microphone, roughly 150 people had gathered. They stood spaced out. Most wore masks. Most were white.Powell, 26, of Clifton, previously worked at the Gap store in Ridgewood. The village is just one of the many places she has felt the anxiety of being unseen because she is black, she said."I know this is uncomfortable,” Powell said. "I know standing here as your neighbors drive past and judge you and say, 'Why are they here? Why are they making trouble?' ⁠— we're not."For all lives to matter,” Powell added, "black lives have to matter first.

He protested alone Tuesday, holding a sign that said "I can't breathe” and showed images pulled from the video of George Floyd's killing."People in this neighborhood have no idea what it's like to be scared,” he said Wednesday.

Steppe said she became discouraged when local leaders didn't respond after Floyd was killed."We've seen the racial inequality in the town,” Steppe said. "We've seen Ridgewood say it's not here. We've watched incidents literally swept under the rug. And it's broken our hearts.”Ridgewood, according to 2018 U.S. Census data, is 73% white and 2% black. On Wednesday, protesters held signs that read "Black lives matter more than white discomfort,” "Do not stand idly by the blood of your neighbor” and "White silence = death.” After leaders finished speaking, they took their signs to the curb, chanting and drawing honks of support from passing cars.NYC PROTESTS: No scout.

"You never think people are going to come.”Protesters took a knee for eight minutes, marking the time that a police officer knelt on Floyd's neck, killing him. Among the people who knelt were a handful of local police officers and Ridgewood Police Chief Jacqueline Luthcke, who wore a black memorial band over her badge.Though Luthcke started wearing the memorial band for COVID-19 victims across the country, she now wears it to remember Floyd, too, she said.Buy PhotoRidgewood Chief of Police, Jacqueline Luthcke, began wearing a black band around her shield to remember the lives lost to COVID-19.

It is a racial issue that if we don't come to the table together, we will never get through.”Having the police chief at the protest showed a willingness from law enforcement to listsen, Lewis said."The police have to be honest with themselves and realize that even though most ones overwhelmingly are doing a good job, there are some that are abusing their power, that are hateful, that can be wicked,” he said. "The good officers have to be willing and able to speak up when they know something's not right.”Alexis Shanes is a local reporter for NorthJersey.com.
