Here are the players who protested in Week 9:San Francisco 49ers: Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, safety Eric Reid and linebacker Eli Harold continued to kneel during the national anthem before Sunday's game against New Orleans. Cornerbacks Rashard Robinson and Keith Reaser continued their protest by raising their right fists during the anthem. Kicker Phil Dawson and defensive Quinton Dial helped hold the flag during the national anthem. Safeties Antoine Bethea and Jaquiski Tartt and running back Mike Davis did not raise their fists as they have done in the past. -- Nick WagonerLos Angeles Rams: Defensive end Robert Quinn raised his right fist during the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Panthers, as has been his custom since the start of the regular season. Quinn said he will continue to do so, regardless of whatever backlash he receives on social media. Said Quinn: "People have the right to voice their opinion. It's up to you whether you listen to it or not. If people feel bad or feel upset about making a stand, that's their personal opinion and judgment. At the end of the day, I'm just standing up for what I believe is right." -- Alden GonzalezSan Diego Chargers: Before Sunday's game against the Titans, offensive linemen Joe Barksdale, D.J. Fluker, Chris Hairston and linebacker Joshua Perry once again raised their fists during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial oppression. -- Eric D. WilliamsTennessee Titans: After the national anthem before the Titans' game against the Chargers, cornerback Jason McCourty and defensive linemen Jurrell Casey, Al Woods and DaQuan Jones all raised a fist in the air. -- Paul KuharskyPhiladelphia Eagles: Safety Malcolm Jenkins raised a fist over his head during the national anthem before Sunday's game at the Giants. He has been doing so since Week 2 against the Bears. Cornerback Ron Brooks typically joins him but has not been present on the sideline the past two games, after undergoing surgery to repair a ruptured quad tendon. Earlier this week, Jenkins talked more about his protest. -- Tim McManus FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmail
