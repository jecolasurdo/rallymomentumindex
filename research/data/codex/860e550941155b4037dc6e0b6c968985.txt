Mandatory Credit: Reinhold Matay-USA TODAY Sports Author: Mike Kaye Published: 4:18 PM EDT September 26, 2016 Updated: 4:20 PM EDT September 26, 2016 JACKSONVILLE, Fla. - Jaguars wide receiver Allen Robinson is joining a roster of NFL players hoping to draw attention to social justice issues. After scoring a touchdown late in the first half Sunday, Robinson threw the ball into the crowd and raised his hands in a "don't shoot" gesture. On Monday, Robinson confirmed the action was in reference to recent police-involved shootings. "Just bringing awareness to a situation that's become problematic in our, my culture,” Robinson said. "I think for us, when you see players taking stands, our culture is a reflection of our reality. The things that are we do are a reflection of our reality.” The Pro Bowl wide receiver is flashy on the field and is the team's top target on offense. Still, he didn't raise too much attention to the gesture during or after the game. "For me, it's something that as I do more research and stuff like that, that's more of what it was about,” Robinson said. "As I learn more about situations – looking at things like that – that's when I make my stance.” He hopes his gesture in the game will help open some eyes and lead to more education on the subject. "I will say it's everyone's culture but everyone doesn't see – so it's tough for me to say,” Robinson said. "It's people saying it's not as big of a problem or things like that, then obviously they're not seeing that. So it's not a problem for them or their culture, it does not affect them. I don't want to speak on anyone else's behalf and signify something that may not be a problem in their culture.” "I don't want to get too political but obviously it's a problem that hopefully we can bring more awareness and shed some light on that.” Follow Mike Kaye on Twitter at @Mike_E_Kaye.
