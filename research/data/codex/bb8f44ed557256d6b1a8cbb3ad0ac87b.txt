Several events were held in and around Boston to call for justice and peace along with demands for change to the criminal justice system and the use of excessive force by police against innocent people of color. The Black Lives Matter movement is intrinsically tied to the push to end police brutality and the use of excessive force as these tactics are more often used to detain people of color, even in situations where the individual has not committed a crime. Content Continues Below The most recent example of police brutality and now the face of the movement is the story of George Floyd, a 43-year-old black man who was detained by police under the assumption he had been using a counterfeit $20 bill. A now former Minneapolis police officer, Derek Chauvin, was recorded kneeling on Floyd's neck, effectively killing him, for nine minutes after Floyd had already been detained, restrained and pushed onto the ground. Protests erupted after the video of the incident went viral, starting first locally in Minneapolis and the surrounding area and then eventually sparking across other cities in all 50 states. After protesters took to the streets to denounce Floyd's death, murder charges were brought against Chauvin and three other police officers. Over a thousand protestors so far have gathered outside City Hall Plaza. #BostonProtests #Boston25 pic.twitter.com/GKmkEc3L8g— Adam Liberatore (@bostonTVguy) June 7, 2020 People of all ages and all races came together to protest together to fight racial injustices locally and across the country.

"I think one of the lessons we've learned, is that unfortunately there are groups that have nefarious intent that are infiltrating some of the peaceful protests, and that's really what we're looking out for,” said Lt. Colonel Bryan Pillai, Military Police Commander with the National Guard. National Guardsmen help police Boston protests on Sunday Lt. Col. Pillai told Boston-25 News that roughly 500 guardsmen and women were stationed in small groups throughout the city to ensure that people could protest safely. Protesters have moved on down Tremont Street from the Boston Common. #BostonProtests #Boston25 pic.twitter.com/CcEKEHs3Dd— Adam Liberatore (@bostonTVguy) June 8, 2020 "We're all from Massachusetts. None of us are responsive to any sort of federal activation. This is a state level entity. We all live here, I've lived many years in the city, this is our hometown, and we want to make sure that it's safe.” Lt. Col. Pillai added that National Guardsmen had been present in Boston throughout the week, standing by as backup to Boston Police in case violence were to escalate like it did on Sunday. "We want to make sure that people can express their opinions and do so in a safe and peaceful manner, and if anything happens that were to disrupt that, we want to be here and present so that we don't have a repeat of what happened on Sunday,” he said.
