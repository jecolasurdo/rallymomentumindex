County Council member Marc Elrich spoke at the afternoon gathering, as did a woman whose ancestors lived in the River Road community; she believes they are buried at the cemetery site.The parking lot and adjoining affordable apartment complex, Westwood Tower, stand on land used as a burial ground in the early 20th century. The property was paved over about six decades ago when the Westbard area was redeveloped, and there is some question about whether bodies were removed at that point.However, church members are adamant that there are still graves at the site and are demanding that county leaders protect the area from current plans to redevelop the Westbard neighborhood.This month, housing commission officials declared that they have no current plans to redevelop the Westwood Tower property, the center of the ongoing battle over the burial site.On Nov. 1, Montgomery County Housing Opportunities Commission Chair Jackie Simon read a statement about the apartment property as protestors lined the back of the room, many carrying signs shaped like headstones."[A]t present, and for the foreseeable future, the Commission has no plan to develop the property,” Simon said. "The Commission intends to purchase Westwood Tower and operate it in its current state.”Coleman-Adebayo said the church is at a disadvantage because of the "cozy relationship” between civic leaders and developers in the county.Council members recently approved a measure to require the Montgomery County Planning Board to create and maintain a countywide inventory of burial sites. A companion bill, which also passed unanimously, would require burial sites to be respected during the subdivision approval process.However, cemetery advocate Kevin Berends, a Takoma Park resident, said the march shows the county needs to do much more to protect historic grave sites from development."There was a preponderance of speakers who were from all walks of life, all persuasions, all religions—Muslim, Christian, Jewish—who are just appalled,” Berends said.No parking garage over historic African Cemetery in Bethesda @HOCMC! #SaveMosesCemetery pic.twitter.com/Uuq0AFzPxg— Caitlin Duffy (@DuffyInDC) November 12, 2017"Black lives matter, alive or dead” — Siki Dlanga.
