Mayor Jim Kenney joined protesters Saturday outside City Hall, kneeling to honor the life of George Floyd and vowing to take action to reform the city's police force and address racial inequities. This week has been humbling. It has shown me—someone who considers themselves to be progressive and an ally—that there is a great deal more for me to learn. Black voices have been silenced for too long.

Kenney knelt at the Octavius Catto statue outside City Hall, then marched with the group to the African American Museum at 7th and Arch Streets, according to spokesperson Deana Gamble. "We are beginning to take action against officers we've seen acting inappropriately, and we will continue to do so. Excessive force will not be tolerated,” the mayor tweeted, as he remained among the protesters. "We'll have more to share on our other commitments to address issues of police violence in the near future.” Gamble said Kenney spoke to protesters, took photos with some, and "thanked them for being there.” He listened to a few speakers at the museum before departing, she said. Kenney said he will "focus on reconciliation, understanding, listening — and yes, action," in a tweet that included a photo of himself speaking into a megaphone held by a protester. Gamble said Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw, as well as several other cabinet members and senior staff members, attended the march with the mayor.

The cut was part of a revised budget Kenney proposed to fill a $649 million budget hole due to the coronavirus pandemic. But the mayor said this week that after "protests have changed the world,” he would reconsider his budget priorities. — Laura McCrystal Share Shares Facebook Twitter 4:00 PM - June 6, 2020 4:00 PM - 06/6/20 4:00 PM - June 6, 2020 Facebook Twitter Demonstrators are dancing at City Hall to 'diffuse a lot of the tension in the air' TIM TAI / Staff Photographer Thousands march down the Benjamin Franklin Parkway in Philadelphia during a protest against the Minneapolis police custody death of George Floyd on Saturday, June 6, 2020.

Kennedy Boulevard thousands of protesters walked up to metal barriers separating them from the Philadelphia police and National Guardsmen stationed between City Hall and the Municipal Services Building. "Is the military allowed to use tear gas on the field of war?” a man with a bullhorn yelled around police to the National Guard. "No, they are not!” Meanwhile, just 100 feet or so away, another large group of several hundred people broke out into dance, even performing the "Cupid Shuffle” together.

"We need a change.” It was his first day participating in the past week of protests, and called it "very peaceful.” He added that he hoped that message would be conveyed by the news media. Salley wasn't convinced the current protests would lead to immediate change — "it's going to take years over years,” he said — but he still felt the protests were important. While some parts of the crowd began to break up, other people kept up their chants from the museum steps. Many sought respite from the heat and sun in patches of shade on the grass.

Demonstrators in Philadelphia on Saturday called for the city to improve policing and racial equity. Their demands included reducing the police department budget and increasing funding for trauma-informed healthcare. Some advocated for abolishing the police and prisons. Some protesters also called for the resignation of Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw after the "gassing of the peaceful” on Interstate 676 on Monday, and for District Attorney Larry Krasner to drop charges against all protesters who have been arrested. Mayor Jim Kenney said this week that he would likely tweak his budget proposal for the next fiscal year, acknowledging that "protests have changed the world.” He faced criticism from demonstrators this week for proposing a $19 million increase to the police budget while reducing other city services to fill a $649 million budget hole due to the impact of the coronavirus. Kenney and Outlaw defended the use of tear gas on protesters on I-676 this week, calling it a "last-resort” measure after protesters filled the highway and surrounded a state trooper's car.

Protesters gathered Saturday morning on Frankford and Allegheny Avenues in Kensington and marched down Allegheny, crossing under the El and passing the National Guard troops stationed in the neighborhood, chanting "Black Lives Matter” and the names of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. The protest had been scheduled as a peace and unity march for the neighborhood, where stores had been looted on May 31, but a city worker told about 20 protesters who arrived Saturday that city officials had asked organizers to cancel the protest because of a larger gathering planned at the Art Museum. Still, protesters marched anyway, drawing cheers from residents hanging out rowhouse windows and approving honks from drivers on the avenue. "I came out, one, because I'm an African American woman who has experienced racism. The earliest was at 8 years old,” said Francine Tucker, the dean of students at Deep Roots Charter School, a neighborhood school that brought out several teachers and children to march on Saturday. "I want my students to see I'm fighting for them. I want to ensure they have a brighter future.” Jameara Austin, 24, a Kensington resident, marched Saturday because she said it was an opportunity to speak up for black lives — and show that residents of Kensington care about changing their community. "Everyone is saying this year has been crazy — I think this year was more about change,” she said. "And sometimes things have to get destroyed for a change to happen. People are just tired.” At F Street, the group paused in silence for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, the amount of time that a police officer pinned George Floyd's neck under his knee. The Rev.

"While it may feel good and provide satisfaction in the moment, [it] will only lead to the potential of other officers and supervisors being seriously injured,” Capt. Christine McShea of the 16th District in West Philadelphia wrote in an email to her staff. "While it may feel like punishment to the administration, it really only punishes other officers.” With Saturday protests expected to draw thousands, Philly police fear "blue flu."

Brian Setnick, 60, of Aston, was captured on video driving by the rally at the intersection of Pennell and Concord Roads, shouting racial slurs and saying "you better watch out,” police said. Aston police also spoke with seven witnesses who reported feeling personally threatened by Setnick's words and actions, according to a news release. Setnick "nearly caused a collision with another vehicle" as a result of his shouting, police said. "We hope that this prosecution makes clear that this community has no room for such hateful and threatening behavior,” Aston Police Chief Dan Ruggieri said in a statement. "I hope that the victims of this crime know that we take these allegations very seriously, and that we will work every day to ensure their safety.” Setnick is charged with one felony count of ethnic intimidation, as well as misdemeanor charges of terroristic threats, recklessly endangering another person, and harassment. He was arraigned Friday, according to court records, and released on $75,000 unsecured bail. Attempts to reach Setnick for comment Saturday morning were unsuccessful. — Laura McCrystal Share Shares Facebook Twitter 7:00 AM - June 6, 2020 7:00 AM - 06/6/20 7:00 AM - June 6, 2020 Facebook Twitter Center City largely shut down to traffic The city has announced street closures and mass transit plans in anticipation of large crowds converging on Philadelphia for protests on Saturday.

Thousands are expected to turn out at the Philadelphia Museum of Art on Saturday in what will likely be the city's largest demonstration yet against police brutality and racial injustice after the death of George Floyd. Despite Friday's rain, which postponed a planned demonstration at LOVE Park and brought hundreds rather than thousands to the streets, protesters traversed the city for a seventh day. Groups marched in Mount Airy, along the Benjamin Franklin Parkway, through South Philadelphia, and to Independence Mall. "The people benefiting from white supremacy are terrified,” Jordan Holbert, 28, told a crowd of about 250 on the steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. "We have to come out here day in and day out and we have to continue to protest.” Major protests are planned for the weekend across the United States, including one in Washington, D.C. expected to be the biggest march in the nation's capital since Floyd's death. In dozens of cities, protests over his death in Minneapolis after a police officer knelt on his neck have lasted for days. » READ MORE: In spite of rain, protesters march for George Floyd; massive Philadelphia march planned for Saturday — Justine McDaniel, Stephanie Farr, Laura McCrystal, Wendy Ruderman Share Shares Facebook Twitter Inquirer Morning Newsletter Get the news you need to start your day Sign Up Inquirer Morning Newsletter twitter facebook instagram News & Info News / Sports / Entertainment / Business / Health / Food / Life / Opinion / Archives / Special Reports About Us About The Philadelphia Inquirer / Advertise / Contact Us / Licensing & Permissions / Photo Reprints / Newspapers in Education / Jobs & Internships / Inquirer Events / Acel Moore Workshops / Newsroom Staff Marketplace Inquirer Store / Find a Home / Job Listings / Special Sections / All Classifieds / Gift Subscriptions Mobile Apps Inquirer News / Philly Sports Now News & Info News Sports Entertainment Business Health Food Life Opinion Archives Special Reports Marketplace Inquirer Store Find a Home Job Listings Special Sections All Classifieds Gift Subscriptions Mobile Apps Inquirer News Philly Sports Now About Us About The Philadelphia Inquirer Advertise Contact Us Licensing & Permissions Photo Reprints Newspapers in Education Jobs & Internships Inquirer Events Acel Moore Workshops Newsroom Staff The Inquirer Digital Edition Subscribe Subscriber Services The Daily News Digital Edition Subscribe Subscriber Services The Inquirer Digital Edition Subscribe Subscriber Services The Daily News Digital Edition Subscribe Subscriber Services © 2020 The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLC Terms of Use/Privacy Policy © 2020 The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLC Terms of Use/Privacy Policy
