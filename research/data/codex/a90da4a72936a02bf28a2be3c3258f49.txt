But for Legacy and her mother, Jewel Miller, who lived with Mr. Garner for several years, it was a moment of private reflection.On Friday morning, they wound their way from their Tompkinsville duplex to the site of Mr. Garner's arrest, trailed by relatives and friends chanting, "I still hear my brother crying: I can't breathe.” Legacy's cheeks, big like her father's, grew red under the sun.ImageThe police arrested a man in Columbus Circle in Manhattan on Friday at a protest that marked the anniversary of the death of Eric Garner.Credit...Richard Perry/The New York Times"I'm nervous,” Ms. Miller told a relative. "You can tell, right?”Just before the dove was released, the crowd of about three dozen people chanted "I can't breathe” 11 times, echoing Mr. Garner's words as his consciousness ebbed.Mr. Garner's death — captured on video and followed a few weeks later by the fatal police shooting of another unarmed black man, Michael Brown, in Ferguson, Mo. — led to calls around New York City and across the country for police reform. The protests flared again in December after a grand jury declined to indict the officer who choked Mr. Garner, Daniel Pantaleo.Earlier this week, the city agreed to pay Mr. Garner's family $5.9 million to settle their wrongful-death claim.At the site of Mr. Garner's death on Friday, his stepfather, Ben Carr, paced the sidewalk, tending to a memorial box filled with plush animals and plastic flowers."I'm hanging in there, I'm hanging in there,” he said mournfully.But he said some good had followed Mr. Garner's death: a marked improvement in the neighborhood's policing."They got new officers on the beat and they're doing a beautiful job,” he said, throwing a hand high in the air to wave at a community affairs officer across the street in Tompkinsville Park.ImageEmerald Garner, second from left, and Emory Garner, third from left, children of Eric Garner, with Esaw Garner, Mr. Garner's widow, listened to the Rev.

Named Samson, the dove had the best homing sense of any of the 40 others he kept at his home in Sayreville, N.J., Mr. Fudger said."They got in touch with me and I told them it would be an honor,” he said. "I mean, police are heroes, but nobody deserves to get choked to death.”In the evening, a few hundred protesters gathered at Columbus Circle in Manhattan and marched through Midtown to Rockefeller Plaza. When they reached Herald Square, some sat and others linked arms in the street. The police repeatedly warned protesters not to block traffic, and several people were arrested. The crowd, chanting and carrying signs that read "Black Lives Matter,” continued to march, including through Pennsylvania Station. Around 10 p.m., the protesters reached Union Square and the crowd began to dissipate. The police said that arrest figures were not immediately available.In Harlem on Friday night, nearly 200 people filled the wooden pews at Canaan Baptist Church of Christ for a vigil led by the Rev. Al Sharpton. Mr. Garner's widow, Esaw Garner, cried and said she had not prepared a speech."That 5.9 don't stop anything,” she said of the settlement. "I'm not stopping until someone goes down in handcuffs.”"I will not stop until I can't breathe,” she added, as the crowd stood and clapped. At another memorial service at the House of the Lord Church in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, more than 100 people filled every row at the church as Mr. Sharpton arrived at about 9 p.m. with Mr. Garner's mother, Gwen Carr.In Ms. Miller's backyard on Friday afternoon, a short walk from Bay Street on Staten Island, she flipped chicken legs on a grill, surrounded by friends who said they wanted to help fill the void left by Mr. Garner's death. The gathering, after the dove was released, was a chance to reflect, she said."I want to hear stories about Eric I didn't know,” she added, chuckling, "like what he would eat at the Spanish restaurant when he was supposed to be on a diet.”Photos displayed nearby included one that showed Legacy and Ms. Miller with Ramsey Orta, who took the pivotal video of the encounter.Mr. Orta sat quietly on a concrete barrier in Ms. Miller's backyard and briefly rocked Legacy in his thin arms. The girl smiled. "I'm just spending time with the family,” Mr. Orta said.As Ms. Miller and her family walked home from Bay Street earlier in the day, the Police Department's Staten Island borough commander, Assistant Chief Edward Delatorre, crossed the street to wish them well. "You guys have a good day,” he said.Ms. Miller did not respond, and later wondered why the police did not reach out like that more often. She kept her eyes fixed on the sidewalk and strode ahead.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite IndexSite Information Navigation© 2020 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpSubscriptions
