Police declared the event an unlawful assembly, and hundreds of LAPD and CHP officers — on foot, on motorcycles and in patrol cars — could be seen converging on the area in video from ABC7's helicopter. At least 50 law-enforcement SUVs were parked in the middle of Van Nuys Boulevard, blocking the street to traffic at Oxnard Street.

(Photo by David Crane, Los Angeles Daily News/SCNG) Show Caption of Expand Most of the protesters had left by 5 p.m. — the time when a countywide curfew began — and about a hundred remained, in contrast to the several hundred in the area during the afternoon. The looting continued into the evening and by about 8:30 p.m. some 60 people were arrested for looting in the area of Sherman Way and Van Nuys Blvd., LAPD Commander Jeff Bert said. Bert said there will be hundreds of additional officers coming to support patrols in the valley. He declined to go into specifics for tactical reasons. @ladailynews #vannuys — Eric Anthony Licas (@EricLicas) June 2, 2020 It was late in the afternoon when looters descended on the commercial strip near the Valley's historic core. The Boost Mobile store on Van Nuys Boulevard was among the businesses ransacked. A window was broken at the Valley Herbal Center marijuana shop on nearby Victory Boulevard. Looters pried open the security gate, broke the window and cleared out the Super Discount Pharmacy on the 14600 block of Victory Boulevard. A number of similar businesses had also been targeted by thieves in search of codeine and other prescription narcotics, Bert said. Media helicopters followed looters as they snaked through Van Nuys alleys, dropping of stolen goods in their vehicles and returning for more. Late Monday afternoon, police spotted a group of suspected looters in a dark-colored Dodge Charger, prompting a police pursuit. Some suspects were seen bailing out of that car during the chase, but the pursuit was continuing as the driver circled area streets. In the early evening, looters were seen on Twitter video hitting the Don Larry Watch & Jewelry shop on Hamlin Street and Kovac's Care Pharmacy on nearby Gilmore Street. The looting continued north along Van Nuys Boulevard, where victimized businesses included the Walgreens drug store and Big 5 Sporting Goods near Sherman Way, Bert said. #LAPD takes suspects into custody at #Walgreens at Van Nuys and Sherman Way Monday afternoon. Looters began hitting Van Nuys after a peaceful #GeorgeFloydProtests pic.twitter.com/zHV7JFYuAb — David Crane (@vidcrane) June 2, 2020 LAPD officers were actively looking for looting suspects and arrested a number of them at the Walgreens. Dozens of detainees lined a curb in front of the store, seated with their arms bound behind their backs with zip ties. Police brought them one by one to the smashed front doors of the business, where officers used the light from inside to read and record suspect information. Telemundo reported that looters broke into the Verizon store at Burbank and Van Nuys boulevards. Police swarmed the intersection and detained two suspects. Two cars were seen burning in the Van Nuys Civic Center area. And as the evening wore on, a Van Nuys strip mall caught fire after it was broken into Monday evening. The Los Angeles Fire Department responded at 7:19 p.m. to a blaze in one unit of the strip mall that was spreading through the attic to other units at Vanowen Street and Haskell Avenue, said spokesman Nicholas Prange. Smoke was seen pouring from the roof in video from media helicopters. LAFD firefighters battled the blaze from a defensive standpoint. Flames gutted a cell phone store and a pharmacy, but there were no occupants in the strip mall, said Prange. The businesses are adjacent to an apartment building. Residents there continued to hose down the smoldering remains of the burned structure after crews had mostly extinguished the fire. #HappeningNow Firefighters respond to a fire at a strip mall at Haskell and Vanowen in #VanNuys @ladailynews pic.twitter.com/9bzC2NxduK — Eric Anthony Licas (@EricLicas) June 2, 2020 Now that looters have hit the area, LAPD Lt. Justin Scott expects to see them head to a protest forming in Granada Hills. "The protesters were great — they were respectful. It's the agitators, and it's unfortunate they have to ruin it.” Protesters were already converging at Chatsworth Street and Zelzah Avenue in Granada Hills, where businesses had spent the day boarding up windows, just like in Van Nuys.

Officers were also stationed in front of businesses on Van Nuys Boulevard near the Civic Center to discourage vandalism and looting. Some in the crowd were throwing water bottles. Police initially closed Sylvan Street but later agreed to leave it open if demonstrators remained on the sidewalk. And now the whole intersections blocked. A couple water bottles thrown, people yelling at throwers to stop and get out of the street. pic.twitter.com/ritwkPsFtF — Ariella Plachta (@AriPlachta) June 1, 2020 But after what looks like a conversation between Kevin Welbeck and and LAPD commander Alan Hamilton, police committed to stand down and reopen traffic if protesters stay on the sidewalk. Demonstrators celebrating it as a win. pic.twitter.com/M1dTPsKDxG — Ariella Plachta (@AriPlachta) June 1, 2020 It all began as the first protest in the San Fernando Valley after a week of mass demonstrations swept Los Angeles County and cities across the nation, with some of those protests sparking major looting, property damage and unrest. Carrying signs late Monday morning into the afternoon, protesters chanted "I can't breathe” in anger over the killing of George Floyd, a black Minneapolis man who died after a police officer used his knee to pin him down by the neck. "We heard the protest was canceled this morning, but a few of us were still planning on coming. It started outside the courthouse and just grew,” said one of the protest leaders Aliyah Reed. "The only way to be heard is to be peaceful.” Metro buses were detouring near the Van Nuys Civic Center due to the protest, the Los Angeles County MetropolitanTransportation Authority announced Monday afternoon. The night before, looters hit a jewelry store and CVS drug store on the 17300 block of Ventura Boulevard in the Encino area, breaking windows and taking what they could at both businesses. Nearly 1,200 people were reportedly arrested Sunday across Los Angeles County as protesters continued clashing with police and National Guard troops. In Santa Monica and Long Beach, looters shattered windows and emptied stores largely unimpeded by law enforcement despite a 6 p.m. curfew. The word of a protest in Van Nuys prompted concern from residents — and particularly business owners who feared they would not financially survive a looting incident after being shuttered for two months due to the coronavirus pandemic. Hundreds of additional officers will be deployed in to augment police in the valley in the wake of the looting that happened in Van Nuys on Monday, and across Southern California over the past several days, Bert said. As L.A. County reportedly told businesses to close for potential protests by 4 p.m., nearby stores — including Ralphs market and CVS at the corner of Burbank and Van Nuys boulevards — boarded up windows, and car dealerships along Van Nuys Boulevard emptied lots of all vehicles. Before the looting broke out, about a dozen local business owners and other community members kept an eye on the ongoing protest in hopes that it wouldn't devolve into lawless violence like in other LA communities. "As long as it's peaceful, we're fine,” said business owner Wendy Martinez from a bus-stop bench across the street from the demonstration. "But we wouldn't be able to recover” if there was a break-in at her restaurant. Martinez said she agrees with the protesters, but her nearby Mariscos El Amateco eatery has been fully shut down for two months for the pandemic, and she paused her insurance coverage to save money.
