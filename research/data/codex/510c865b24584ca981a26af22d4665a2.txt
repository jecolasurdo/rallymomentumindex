As the national anthem was being performed pregame, 14 Michigan players (names unknown) held a fist to the air, as we have seen from a number of football players both in college and NFL this season. The players also picked a strategic place to do so, unless it was completely coincidental. Counted 14 Wolverines raising their fists during national anthem. Entire group was standing right in front of Jim Harbaugh. — Brian Bennett (@BennettESPN) October 1, 2016 Here's video of the protesting, via ESPN: This is somewhat noteworthy because of recent comments made by Harbaugh when asked about Kaepernick's national anthem protests. Harbaugh of course coached Kaepernick in San Francisco. "I acknowledge his right to do that,” Harbaugh said on August 29. "But I don't respect the motivation or the action.” Harbaugh did apologize shortly afterward for his delivery on his comments about the anthem protesting by Kaepernick. I apologize for misspeaking my true sentiments. To clarify, I support Colin's motivation. It's his method of action that I take exception to — Coach Harbaugh (@CoachJim4UM) August 29, 2016 Maybe it was a coincidence that Michigan players stood with a raised fist in front of Harbaugh, or maybe it was intentional. Either way, Michigan managed to stick together and score a hard-fought defensive victory against Wisconsin to remain undefeated.
