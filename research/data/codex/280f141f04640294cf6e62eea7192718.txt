Not necessarily for the protest's message, but how the message was displayed. That "sit-in" protest was held inside the Marywood University Rotunda Tuesday evening. The students protested the grand jury decision out of Ferguson, Missouri. Such protests have been happening across the country. But at Marywood, school officials took issue with how the students used the American flag. It's been a week characterized by walk-outs and sit-ins at schools across the country. Some Marywood University students never expected it on their quiet campus. "I don't think it's necessary. I understand you're free to speak anywhere you want, but I don't think it was appropriate to do it here for no reason," said junior Alissa Giannettio. A student protest held on Tuesday at the university has turned out to be much more polarizing than some students expected, too. The protesters laid on the floor of the Marywood University Rotunda. They were protesting the grand jury decision out of Ferguson, Missouri last month that found there wasn't enough evidence to indict a police officer for the shooting death of teenager Michael Brown. But Marywood and many of its students took issue with one part of the student protest. They displayed an upside down American flag with messages written on it. They read "No justice on stolen land" and "Black lives matter." "I think everyone has their right to have their own opinion, but I don't think our American symbol, our American flag, should have been put into it," said freshman Angelika Juzwa. "I still think it's kind of disrespectful. I didn't feel like it needed to go that far. I understand the protesting and I understand what people believe, but I feel like it could have been done maybe some other way," added freshman Nadia Lipperini. University officials had the protesters' flag removed Tuesday. It was replaced anonymously with another one, right side up and accompanied with this message: "Yesterday protesters defaced the American flag. May this flag only represent freedom and those who have died for it." Marywood University won't punish the protesters, but the school is not standing behind them. Most of the student body isn't either. "I think if you want to express that you should do it in a more mature manner," said student Neal Phillips. Late Wednesday afternoon, Marywood University President Sister Anne Munley released this statement: "As stated yesterday, Marywood University understands our students' first amendment rights to freedom of speech, peaceable assembly, and freedom of the press, but we abhor the desecration of the United States flag. Such an action is inconsistent with the mission of Marywood and our core values. As an institution of higher learning, we recognize that the circumstances of yesterday have created the opportunity for education and dialogue. Due to the nature of the events, disagreements are expected; it is our hope, however, that this will be a learning experience for our students and for all in the broader community who wish to engage in respectful dialogue." The following statement was released by the Marywood Student Veteran Alliance: "Yesterday afternoon a few students of the Marywood Community exercised their right to protest. As part of the protest, a defaced American flag was displayed. We know many of you are outraged and we understand. We are saddened that the actions of our fellow students affected so many throughout the community. Although we all may have conflicting opinions on how these students protested, at the end of the day, part of our job as military personnel is to fight for their First Amendment rights to free speech and peaceful protest. While we support their right to demonstrate peacefully, we do not support the way in which they went about it, namely the defacement of the flag. While it is permissible under the First Amendment, we feel it is disrespectful and offensive to all of us who were willing to give our lives in order to ensure that these students had that right to a peaceful protest. The purpose of the protest was diverted once the focus shifted from the matters at hand to the focus of defacement of the flag. To those of you who are angered by this, we want to remind all of you of the support that Marywood has shown to veterans on our campus and in our community. This year Marywood hosted both our 3rd Annual Flags for the Fallen Display and our 3rd Annual Veteran's Appreciation Luncheon, as well as the grand opening of the Veterans Resource Center. We are the only campus in our area to have such a facility and the Student Veteran Alliance is very grateful to Marywood for their support and generosity. The Student Veteran Alliance is committed to conducting ourselves with the core values that were instilled in us during our time of military service, along with the core values of Marywood University. "Please know that the Student Veteran Alliance officers had an opportunity to sit down with fellow members of our student body today including some members of the protest. It was a respectful conversation and gave both sides an opportunity to hear from the other. The student protesters acknowledged our perspective and sincerely apologized for any offense. It was not their intent and they now understand how it came across. It was a great opportunity to educate our non-veteran students on our views and we were grateful for the opportunity. "We regret that this happened on our campus, and are available at any time to discuss any issues you may have concerning this incident. Let's use this as a way of respectfully opening discussions and to see both sides of this debate through each other's eyes. Thank you for your time. Stay Strong."
