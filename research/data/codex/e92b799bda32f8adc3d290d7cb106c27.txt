She eventually stopped singing prompting cheers from the crowd. Other performances were also drowned out. The lighting of the tree, however, happened as planned at 7:55 as protesters looked on.

"Our job is to see to it that they can protest and at the same time, families that want to come down and see the Christmas tree lit have a chance to do that," said Ramsey.
