The latest round of destruction comes a day after city police chief Brian Layton took a knee with protestors who gathered at Market Square. "Our message is clear: We support peaceful protesters. We do not support the agitators who are showing up to peaceful protests & hijacking them w/ intent to cause chaos. We will not let agitators take away from law-abiding protesters who wish to be heard.” #FXBG PD Chief Layton pic.twitter.com/1habGKTQ8z — FredericksburgPolice (@FXBGPolice) June 3, 2020 Meanwhile, further up Route 1 in Woodbridge, police in Prince William County have been out with a group of peaceful protestors since 3 p.m. They've escorted the group from Americana Grocery, located at 14428 Jefferson Davis Highway, up down the road between Blackburn Road and Longview Drive.

These "protests” have nothing to do with Floyd. The government is distracting you from something bigger. Reply Island Beauty says: June 6, 2020 at 10:20 am This isn't a Democrat/Republican thing...it's about bringing highlight to black men getting treated unfairly by racists cops. Stop deflecting from the truth at hand! #blacklivesmattertoo Reply Lewis says: June 5, 2020 at 12:53 pm Why aren't we protesting in front of the police station Reply Leave a Review or Comment Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
