Author: Caylee Kirby (WTOL) Published: 8:12 PM EDT June 3, 2020 Updated: 8:12 PM EDT June 3, 2020 PERRYSBURG, Ohio — 'Hands up, don't shoot', 'I can't breathe', 'no justice, no peace,' are just a few of the chants protesters shouted for two hours while walking from Woodlands Park to the Perrysburg Police Station. While marching, protest attendees reflected on the injustices still happening in America. The demonstration comes after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis, which has since sparked protests in all 50 states and nations across the world. "I hope that there's more recognition and that people actually realize that there is a problem in the justice system that needs to be fixed," protester Cassandra Tetrey said. Floyd's death and the public outcry for racial justice hit close to home for Tetrey. As an adopted black woman, she says there are people outside her immediate family who don't wasn't to know her because of the color of her skin. "I'm here because I think I stand with everyone in saying we're tired of seeing innocent black men, women, and children lose their lives. I'm here as an ally to help amplify the calls and help hopefully bring about change," protester Madison Waldvogel said.

Many of those said they hope that by showing support, positive things can come from Floyd's death and that support doesn't stop at the protests. One Sylvania resident said he attended this protest after going to one of the demonstrations held in Toledo. "It's almost surreal. I would say in Toledo, it was pretty eye-opening. I'm still learning myself, it's not just about having black friends. It's about supporting the black community and that's what it's about right now," he said. This was the first protest held in Perrysburg and it was completely organized by teenagers from the area. The protest began at Woodlands Park. Attendees marched down Indiana Avenue to the Perrysburg police building and then walked back to the park. Among those walking more than two miles from the park to the police station and back were city leaders. "I think we also have to appreciate that there's been a lot of hate and injustice over time and we need to work every day to make sure that Perrysburg is a welcoming community. And so, we've started taking those steps. We think this action with this event is a good opportunity to continue that process," Perrysburg Mayor Tom Mackin said. He said it was important for him to attend and show his support. Other area officials peacefully protesting included Perrysburg Schools Superintendent Tom Hosler, Perrysburg Fire Division Chief Rudy Ruiz, and Perrysburg Police Chief Patrick Jones. "What they're protesting is what all officers should be protesting. It's the unequal treatment of others, especially minorities. It's the death of George Floyd, the death of countless others who these deaths should not have happened. So every police officer who holds these values should be out here protesting," Perrysburg Police Chief Patrick Jones said. Jones and Mackin mentioned how important this time is to stand up and create change. Both also say they will be attending more if they are held.
