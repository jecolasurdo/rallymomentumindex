Organisers said the Melbourne march was "a peaceful rally in solidarity with our brothers and sisters across the Pacific" to show that "all lives matter".They also said it highlighted the deaths of Indigenous Australians in custody.One speaker at the rally told the crowd: "People say to me 'Get back on the boat'. I didn't come here by boat, I came here by Qantas.""There is only one race, that is the human race," he said.The march was then led by mounted police along Swanston Street to Federation Square and staged a sit-in outside Flinders St station. Speakers at the rally gathered outside the State Library of Victoria.(ABC News: Guy Stayner)Posted 17 JulJuly 2016SunSunday 17 JulJuly 2016 at 3:55am, updated 17 JulJuly 2016SunSunday 17 JulJuly 2016 at 1:37pmShareFacebookTwitterArticle share optionsShare this onFacebookTwitterLinkedInSend this byEmailMessengerCopy linkWhatsAppRelated StoriesActivists say 'clock is turning back on black people in America'Nurse in protest photo describes Baton Rouge arrest as 'work of God'More on:MelbourneVICMulticulturalismCommunity and SocietyRace RelationsTop Stories'Cyber attacks' are retaliation from China's spy agency for Huawei's 5G ban, insiders sayAustralia is being targeted by cyber attacks.
