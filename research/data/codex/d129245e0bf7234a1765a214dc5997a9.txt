Protests for Black Lives Matter gain momentum in Kitsap through the weekendJosh Farley, Kitsap Sun Published 1:50 p.m. PT June 7, 2020 | Updated 9:50 a.m. PT June 8, 2020CLOSECONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORESILVERDALE — Protests continued to swell around Kitsap County over the weekend in the wake of George Floyd's death, calling for changes to eliminate systemic racism against African-Americans.The rallies, from Bainbridge Island to Port Orchard, have been peaceful save for one confrontation in Silverdale on Saturday, when the owner of a restaurant clutched a Taser as protesters marched by on Bucklin Hill Road. "Police brutality is an epidemic in our country. We can't have it anymore," said Madison Grant, one of the organizers of the Silverdale protest and the just-formed Kitsap Youth Action Team.

The protest was organized by a group of Kitsap County youth, and was one of several planned for the weekend and beyond in Kitsap County.

As a young black woman, she felt the death of Floyd on May 25. She said it was "the straw that broke the camel's back" in a long line of deaths of African-Americans. Grant said organizers wanted to host a rally that was safe and included masks during a time of the COVID-19 pandemic. Silverdale's protest and march included traffic control and road closures by the Kitsap County Sheriff's Office, including Sheriff Gary Simpson. It began at Old Mill Park before moving to the sidewalks of Bucklin Hill Road. Chants of "No more silence," and "I can't breathe," filled the air. Cars honked as they drove by. Local activist and mentor Karen Vargas staged an action at one point in which she lay face down in the crosswalk in the middle of the street, surrounded by fellow protesters. LIVE: Black Lives Matter protest in SilverdalePosted by Kitsap Sun on Saturday, June 6, 2020Then, they took to the streets, marching to the mouth of Clear Creek and taking a knee on the Bucklin Hill Bridge, with police in the distance providing roadblocks. From there, as marchers went uphill past Maynard's Restaurant, "JJ” Meland, its owner, was spotted holding a Taser. He argued with protesters. Some in the crowd believed it was a gun. A Facebook post from Maynard's later issued an apology, with the owner saying he "felt threatened" by a protester and supports the Black Lives Matter movement. But that post has since been removed, as has the entire Maynard's Facebook page as of Sunday afternoon.The protest reached Tracyton Boulevard, where marchers locked arms, held a moment of silence and sang Bill Withers' "Lean on Me." Then, back down the hill they came, trekking all the way past Old Mill Park and to the edge of Silverdale Way, where Kitsap County Sheriff Gary Simpson was personally helping with traffic control. They chanted "America must change" along the way. Simpson was spotted giving business cards to some of the organizers. Meanwhile, on Bainbridge Island, hundreds of protesters filled Winslow Way at Highway 305, near the city's police station, before marching up the city's main drag and heading north on Madison Avenue. A protest was planned in Port Orchard on Sunday as well. Another protest is slated for 4:30 p.m. Monday at Evergreen-Rotary Park in Bremerton.
