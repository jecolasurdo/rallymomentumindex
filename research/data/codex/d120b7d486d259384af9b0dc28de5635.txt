Demonstrators gathered outside the federal courthouse in downtown Milwaukee late Monday afternoon. There, they stood in solidarity with those in Missouri -- holding a moment of silence for Michael Brown. Brown was unarmed when he was gunned down by a Ferguson police officer. The incident involving Michael Brown has sparked a nationwide movement. In Milwaukee on Monday, before feet hit the pavement and chants echoed inside the Grand Avenue Mall, a crowd heard from speakers -- including Alderwoman Milele Coggs. "We are not going to stop what we are currently doing," Verona Swanigan said. Swanigan is a Milwaukee attorney, who just returned from Ferguson, Missouri. "I was more afraid, definitely more afraid of the police officers there than any citizen I've ever met," Swanigan said. The demonstration was held outside the federal courthouse because the group is asking for Eric Holder and the Department of Justice to use their full power to investigate possible police brutality across the country. They also say they have some demands on the local level -- that the relationship be repaired between the African-American community and Milwaukee police. During Monday's demonstration, organizers spoke of the shooting of 31-year-old Dontre Hamilton -- a mentally ill man, shot and killed by a Milwaukee police officer on April 30th. Demonstrators are seeking more information to be released in the case. The shooting happened inside downtown Milwaukee's Red Arrow Park, where some demonstrators gathered before making their way to the federal courthouse. Among those on the courthouse steps Monday was Dontre Hamilton's brother. "We can change Milwaukee, and from Milwaukee we can change Wisconsin," Nathaniel Hamilton said. The Hamilton family met with Milwaukee police on Monday -- but they say they continue to seek more information -- including the name of the officer who shot and killed Dontre. "What sets us apart from Ferguson? What makes them able to get this information in two weeks and here we are four months alter and we don't have any information?" Nathaniel Hamilton said. "The emphasis here is on law enforcement around the country to repair strained relationships with the community -- so we are looking at Milwaukee and the strained relationship here is pretty prevalent," Mike Wilder said. Milwaukee police say Hamilton was shot and killed when he took an officer's baton inside Red Arrow Park. Police didn't issue a statement on their meeting with the Hamilton family on Monday -- but they did assist by shutting down streets for protesters. Organizers say they're planning another demonstration for this Friday, August 29th. Protest outside federal courthouse.

August 25, 2014 at 5:24 pm diane If you do the crime you do the time...being a career criminal should not be a path pursued...or encouraged by leniency...once a felon your job opportunities are greatly diminished...so before you take up a life if crime think once or twice...the choice you make is your own but beware of the sometimes lethal consequences...society owes no one anything but an equal playing field if you play by societies rules August 25, 2014 at 5:29 pm Michael McCormack They feel that Ferguson, MO is getting all of the racist attention is why they are protesting, stopping traffic, and breaking the law. What a wonderful example of how things were not supposed to work in this country. They make me ashamed of a city in which I have spent almost all of my life as they are turning it in to a welfare haven and slum. Shame on all of you and your peaceful democratic party.

One is law abiding with upkept homes ,people driving normally, people walking the streets that you are not afraid of, no garbage of the streets.

August 25, 2014 at 8:10 pm dancing in the ruins i have the answer: let's just pull all the cops out of the inner city completely. the people who live there don't pay taxes or obey the law anyway. since they blame everything on the cops let's just not send them in there. wouldn't that make them happy?

August 25, 2014 at 9:04 pm 2econd so why are these crowds allowed to parade around and stop traffic etc.., sounds like there is no rhyme or reason to their madness. thought that there was to be a plan put into place as to where "peaceful” marches were going to go. these people are just roaming aimlessly. where are the arrests, fines etc.? also, don't any of these people have jobs? or are we all paying for them to roam and cause trouble?
