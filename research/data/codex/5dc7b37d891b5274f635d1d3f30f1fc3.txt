(WCAX) Citizens are speaking out against Burlington Police as the department faces two excessive force lawsuits. Close to 50 protesters gathered outside of City Hall on Monday to express their concerns over the two body camera videos that were recently released. Protesters called for the firing of those officers in those videos and the officer involved in the fight with Douglas Kilburn, who then died three days later. The crowd questioned why it took months for the body camera footage to be released. "What I saw in the body camera video was a vicious attack on a person of color on the screen," said Kevin Rogers, a protester and a graduate of the California Law Enforcement Academy. "I believe there's a culture of cover-up and concealment in the Burlington Police Department." Citizens took to the podium to share their experiences with the police. They also criticized leadership at the police department. "Del Pozo knows what he's doing. He is a Dartmouth graduate, he went to an Ivy League," said one protester. "He knows what he's doing. He knows that his officers are attacking people of color." During the event, people chanted the names of those who have been killed by police around the country such as Sandra Bland, Freddie Gray, and Michael Brown. After an hour and a half of protesting, they went inside to confront the City Council and Burlington Police Chief Brandon del Pozo. Del Pozo presented a slideshow of the police department's policies regarding de-escalation, use of force and body camera footage. He also addressed protester's concerns that these incidents caught on body camera were racially-motivated. "In 2018, we finally got Dr. Marks to give full training in implicit bias. A one-day course, not just four hours but the full day, to all of our officers," del Pozo said. "Plus, I believe, City Council. Plus about 150 other cops in Vermont." Protesters say they won't be satisfied until the three officers are fired and leadership changes within the city are made. City Councilor Brian Pine told the crowd that the events of the body camera videos are not reflective of Burlington values. Pine said he will do what he can to reaffirm those values and connect with people in a meaningful way. Mayor Miro Weinberger, D-Burlington, says he understands why people are upset by the body camera footage and calls the latest incidents damaging to the trust between police and the community. But he says progress has been made under del Pozo's leadership and he continues to support him. To help repair the relationship with the community and check in on the police department, Weinberger is pitching a plan to create a group that represents the whole community, including the city council, people of color and police. Members would take a look at policies and officer training and be supported with funds and experts. 100 Days of Cuomo: Governor ends daily COVID-19 briefings Related Stories Burlington police host annual community barbecue Burlington Progressives call for review of police use of force policy City Council discuss death of Burlington man, police chief response VSP death investigation spotlights differing police practices Burlington police, mayor warned not to interfere in investigation Death of man following fight with police ruled homicide News Weather Astronomy Closings Radar Ski & Board Report SkyWatch3 WCAX Weather App Weather FAQ Weather Features Sports Friday Football Frenzy Community Station Advertise With Us Community Partners Got a Story Idea?
