We understand that that was bad, we understand that that's not right, and that we are not going to stand for it either,” he said.Sheriff Poulin added that he expects things to remain peaceful into the night.He said, "We need a positive message to get across and any additional violence and malicious destruction of property, that doesn't help anybody and it's not going to help our community.” The protesters agree, after demonstrations in Grand Rapids erupted into hours of violence Saturday into Sunday.One protester said, "I hate that it happened, I really do because, what did that solve other than people are having to rebuild their home they are businesses?”They said that will only take away from their message, which is one they so badly want heard.The sheriff's office said they would be keeping a close eye on groups and gatherings that get out of hand throughout the night and will have extra patrols out.
