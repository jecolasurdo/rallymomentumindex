FRAMINGHAM – A Black Lives Protest peacefully marched from the Framingham Centre Common, down Union Avenue to the Memorial Building, and back to the Framingham Common this afternoon, June 3. The organizer of the protest march was Noah Montano Rodriguez, 16. The protest was planned by Keefe Tech students and their families, according to Framingham Police. "Violence is not the answer,” said Montano Rodriguez, who attends Keefe Tech Regional High School. He said he wants to become a police officer. he wore a mask that said "I can't breathe.” More than 125 individuals, of all races, marched in the protest. The protests have been happening all over Massachusetts and America after a black man was killed while in custody of white police officers in Minneapolis. Last Monday, while handcuffed Floyd, a black man, died in police custody in Minneapolis. A white police officer Derek Chauvin pushed his knee into Floyd's neck, as he cried that he could not breathe. On Tuesday, Chauvin and three other police officers were fired, after a bystander's video showed the incident. The FBI is now investigating the death, and on Friday arrested Chauvin. Today, June 3, it was announced the other three former Minneapolis police officers on the scene when Floyd died were being charged with aiding and abetting a murder, and the murder case against former police officer Chauvin was upgraded to second degree. When the protesters reached the Memorial Building, the individuals laid down on the ground, to mark the time Floyd was on the ground, in handcuffs, under the knee of the Minneapolis Police Officer. Framingham School Resource Officer Jay Ball was among those who marched. Ball was previously assigned to Keefe Technical High School, but is now assigned to Framingham High School. Framingham School Resource Officer Kathy McGrath was observed supporting the protesters outside the Framingham Police Station in the parking lot between the station and the Memorial Building. *** Petroni Media Company photos for SOURCE ← Framingham State University Launches Intensive Program Focused on Race and Equity Training K9 Unit & Framingham Police Search For Possible Armed Robbery Suspect → editor email: editor@FraminghamSource.com call or text at 508-315-7176 Categories Arts & Entertainment ASHLAND SOURCE Business Community Education Environment/Sustainability Family Food & Drink Government Health Holiday Jobs Marlborough Source MetroWest SOURCE NATICK SOURCE Obits Opinion Pets Police/Fire Politics Real Estate Religion Social Justice SOURCE Sports State & Federal Government Sudbury SOURCE Uncategorized Weather Recent Posts Exhibit A's Beer Garden Gets Green Light From City Solicitor Indoor Dining, Nail Salons & Personal Services Can Begin Monday in Massachusetts Massachusetts House & Senate Members File Legislation To Make Juneteenth a State Holiday VIDEO: Curb-Side Library Pick-Up Tips Framingham Mayor Spicer Endorses Kennedy For U.S. Senate Gov.
