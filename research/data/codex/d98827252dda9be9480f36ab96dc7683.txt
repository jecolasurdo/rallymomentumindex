CBS2's Brittney Hopper said the march — which began around 3 p.m. — focused on two cases involving police fatally shooting Noel Aguilar and Jesse Delgadillo. Noel Aguilar, 23, was shot by police in May of this year. Jesse Delgadillo, 24, was shot in April 2013. The men's mothers were scheduled to participate in the rally. Witnesses said Aguilar was handcuffed at the time he was fatally shot. It was about a year after and in the same neighborhood where police also gunned down Delgadillo, described as a longtime Aguilar friend. At the time of the shooting, police said Aguilar was a known gang member who tried to take an officer's gun. A deputy was also shot in the stomach and survived his injuries. Officials also said Aguilar was shot when he grappled with an officer for his weapon. Police said Delgadillo was shot after he pulled a weapon during a confrontation. "There's a problem going around,” said one protester, "with officers shooting people. It's up to us to stand. It's up to us to really make a stand and say something is wrong. Our justice system isn't perfect, it isn't good. And I'm here to just bring attention to it.” Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Follow Us facebook_urltwitter_urlyoutube_urlinstagram_urlreddit_urllinkedin_url Our | NewsletterMost Viewed 'He Ran Because He Was Scared': LASD Deputies Shoot, Kill Auto Body Shop Security Guard In Gardena Four OC Restaurants Close As COVID Cases Jump Newsom Announces Statewide Face Mask Mandate For California iPhone 11 Stolen From Looted T-Mobile Store Tracked To San Bernardino Home; 2 Arrested Half-Brother Of Robert Fuller Killed In Kern County Shootout With LA Deputies, Woman Wounded Torrance Police Locate Woman Accused Of Going On Racist Tirade, No Arrest Made 'That '70s Show' Actor Danny Masterson Charged With Forcible Rape Of 3 Women Two Men Found Shot To Death In Cars In Willowbrook, Compton LAPD Searching For 2 Men Accused Of Up To 13 Incidents Of Groping In Los Angeles Area Caught On Camera: Rough Arrest In Compton Under Investigation After Video Shared On Social Media Follow Us FacebookTwitterYouTubeInstagramRedditLinkedIn News LA NewsLA WeatherBusinessConsumerEntertainmentInvestigative Sports LakersLos Angeles Lakers News And Updates From CBS 2 And KCAL 9ClippersLos Angeles Clippers News And Updates From CBS 2 And KCAL 9DodgersLos Angeles Dodgers News And Updates From CBS 2 And KCAL 9AngelsLos Angeles Angels Of Anaheim News And Updates From CBS 2 And KCAL 9RamsLos Angeles Rams News And Updates From CBS 2 And KCAL 9ChargersLos Angeles Chargers News And Updates From CBS 2 And KCAL 9College Sports Watch + Listen MusicVideoPodcastsSeen On TVOnly CBSBest Of LABest Of Orange County Corporate About UsAdvertiseConnect Station Info About CBS2 / KCAL9 ©2020 CBS Broadcasting Inc.
