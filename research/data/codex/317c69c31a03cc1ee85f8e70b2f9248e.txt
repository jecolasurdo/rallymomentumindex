The greatly outnumbered Confederate Square Group held its rally Saturday in Hot Springs National Park. It was the group's fourth demonstration of the year on Arlington Lawn, but the first since last weekend's deadly white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Authorities said both demonstrations were relatively peaceful. Police made two arrests, but it was unclear whether they were protesters or counterprotesters, and what they were arrested for. Organizers at the confederate group had said the rally didn't support white nationalism. About 15,000 demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi slogans marched Saturday in Boston, with many gathering near a bandstand abandoned early by conservatives who planned a "free speech rally."Latest NewsNewsRapper Hurricane Chris arrested after man shot, killed in ShreveportUpdated: 48 minutes agoHe is charged with second-degree murder.NewsRegion 8 improving while COVID-19 goes up in LouisianaUpdated: 1 hour agoHospitalizations are going up across the state, but the Monroe area is improving.NewsFour juveniles arrested after West Ouachita HS burglariesUpdated: 2 hours agoMore arrests are expected.NewsEBT, P-EBT cards will be down for several hours this weekend (June 20-21)Updated: 2 hours agoLouisiana EBT and P-EBT cards will be down for several hours over the June 20-21 weekend.NewsMan succumbs to injuries from Jonesville house fireUpdated: 2 hours agoState Fire Marshal deputies continue to investigate the circumstances surrounding a house fire that claimed the life of the single occupant.Latest NewsNews As cases spike, Gov.
