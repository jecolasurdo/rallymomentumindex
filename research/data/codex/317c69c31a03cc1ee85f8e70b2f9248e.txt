The greatly outnumbered Confederate Square Group held its rally Saturday in Hot Springs National Park. It was the group's fourth demonstration of the year on Arlington Lawn, but the first since last weekend's deadly white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. Authorities said both demonstrations were relatively peaceful. Police made two arrests, but it was unclear whether they were protesters or counterprotesters, and what they were arrested for. Organizers at the confederate group had said the rally didn't support white nationalism. About 15,000 demonstrators chanting anti-Nazi slogans marched Saturday in Boston, with many gathering near a bandstand abandoned early by conservatives who planned a "free speech rally."Latest NewsNewsMonroe unveiling monument for former Kansas City Chief Joe DelaneyUpdated: 1 hour agoJoe Delaney died trying to save drowning children at Chennault Park.NewsTrump's HHS pushes LGBT health rollback, despite Supreme Court rulingUpdated: 1 hours agoThe Trump administration Friday moved forward with a rule that rolls back health care protections for transgender people, even as the Supreme Court barred sex discrimination against LGBT individuals on the job.NewsPhillies: 5 players test positive for virus at Florida campUpdated: 3 hours agoFive players for the Philadelphia Phillies have tested positive for COVID-19 at the team's spring camp in Florida, prompting the club to indefinitely close the complex.NewsLSU board votes in favor of removing Middleton name from libraryUpdated: 4 hours ago|By Mykal VincentThe LSU Board of Supervisors adopted a resolution Friday to strip Troy H.
