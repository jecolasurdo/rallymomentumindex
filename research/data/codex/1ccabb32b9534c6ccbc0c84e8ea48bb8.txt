People of all backgrounds, ages and skin colors came out to the protest with signs in hand as they united in chants to support Salisbury's black community. Jackson explained that her idea to hold the protest came to fruition following the spike in black lives being mistreated and taken at the start of quarantine. After having sleepless nights and hard conversations with her friends, Jackson felt the need to speak out and take action against the mistreatment and brutality that has plagued our country. "It has been heart wrenching but no one has really said anything until George Floyd and that was the last straw," Jackson said. "So,I wanted to make a change in Salisbury because being a small town, people think we can't do much, but there's definitely strength in numbers."The protest began with a prayer for the safety and lives of the black community, and led into a story that sparked the civil rights movement. Professor of English at SU Lilia Dobos attended the protest as a means of standing with not only her black students and colleagues, but with the greater black community as a whole. "I came out to support the movement and stand in solidarity," Dobos said. College professors and students were not the only one's who came to march in solidarity, for Salisbury local and 10 year old Ellie Hapner attended the walk as well. Hapner highlighted that hurting others because of their skin color is wrong and anyone with eyes and a heart should recognize that."I heard the story about the people that died and I didn't think it was fair," Hapner said as she held a sign that read: 'I thought it was protect and serve, not kill and murder.'Following the speeches, the march ensued and with it came the unity of chants supporting solidarity and the equality of the black community.By CAROLINE STREETTGull Life editorFeatured photos by Caroline Streett Images.News167 views3 Â© 2019 The Flyer Looking for an article?
