LOUIS • About 50 people marched Tuesday night in St. Louis in the fourth week of protests over the not-guilty verdict in the murder trial of a former city police officer. The protest was a continuation of a series prompted by the acquittal Sept. 15 of St. Louis police Officer Jason Stockley in the fatal shooting of drug suspect Anthony Lamar Smith after a high-speed chase.After meeting outside Northwest High School about 6 p.m., the protesters marched to the scene of the shooting at West Florissant and Acme avenues, where they observed three minutes of silence for the six years between the shooting and the acquittal. They spoke about Smith and repeated what organizers have said is their message: "Stop killing us." "To go back to that spot, to take the protests back to the very spot where Anthony Lamar Smith lost his life, that's important for us to not forget," Cori Bush, who has helped organize recent protests, said after the march. "We protest in other areas, but that's where that young man lost his life and we need to put a focus on that because this is our neighborhood. (Smith) was somebody in car a going down the same street that we drive down all the time.”The group stopped to block traffic at busy intersections along Riverview Boulevard and West Florissant as they marched. A few families walked out of their houses to watch. The marchers were closely followed by other protesters in their cars and by police, who redirected traffic behind the group. As the protesters returned to the school, a smaller group saw a police car on a side street and marched toward it, chanting "Who do you protect? Who do you serve?" The car backed down the one-way street in reverse. Protesters followed the car to end of the street before eventually turning and walking back to Riverview.The protest Tuesday night, the first of several actions planned for the week, saw the smallest protest group since the Sept. 15 acquittal.Organizers plan to march again Wednesday after attending a panel discussion on policy issues related to policing and racial equity. State Rep. Bruce Franks Jr., a leader of the protests, and Mayor Lyda Krewson will take part in the panel. Bush said protests will continue until regional leaders "acknowledge that black lives matter.""We need you to say black lives matter, and that we're going to fight to make sure everybody acknowledges that and that there is equity and equality within St. Louis," she said. "You take care of black people the same way you take care of anybody else in this community. "Love people first. Until that happens we have to be out here.” 0 comments 15986 Tags St. Louis St. Louis Police Jason Stockley Anthony Lamar Smith Riverview Boulevard West Florissant Avene Protest March Demonstration Black Lives Matter Protester Politics Law Highway Work Law and order Missouri executions Law and order Crime tracker Law and order St. Louis-area serial killers Shake off your afternoon slump with the oft-shared and offbeat news of the day, hand-brewed by our online news editor, Mandy St. Amand.
