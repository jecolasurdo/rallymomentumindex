On the day of the event, she raised that number to 70. At 4 p.m. Wednesday afternoon, more than 500 people from around the metro Detroit area flocked to Kellogg Park to raise awareness and peacefully protest police brutality and racism in response to the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis May 25.

With protesters holding signs that read "No lives matter until black lives matter,” and "I refuse to be silent,” chanting "No justice, no peace” and marching around downtown Plymouth, people continued the trend that had been prevalent in major cities like Detroit. And while Plymouth had seen its share of demonstrations and protests in Kellogg Park in its history, Mayor Oliver Wolcott said this one feels different.Protesters take a moment of silence with their fists up to honor the death of George Floyd. (Photo: Colin Gay | Hometown Life)"It's powerful,” Wolcott said. "I think it's galvanized people of all backgrounds, all races and really all ages. I commend the organizers of this group: it was done peacefully, it was organized, it had a message and, hopefully, people across the country are listening and part of the larger conversation.” While many came to protest the same cause, different people had different paths to downtown Plymouth on Wednesday afternoon. Here are three of their stories. 'Am I next?' Brian Clark has never lived in Detroit. The South Lyon resident said he grew up in an all-white neighborhood and went to school primarily with white people. "I remember being young and learning about civil rights,” Clark said. "I said, 'Man, if I was alive during that time, I would march with Dr. King, I would have sat with Rosa Parks.' But here I am, still facing the same issues, and I have nothing. I have not allocated my time, my money or my resources, or even my skill set, making a difference.” With all of the racial protests occurring in a city 30 minutes away — a city that he does not frequent very often, he said — Clark said his biggest inspiration for protesting the young people, specifically his niece. Brian Clark protested with his wife and his sister in law in Plymouth. (Photo: Colin Gay | Hometown Life)"She had been posting things that I had been afraid to say my whole life,” Clark said. When he saw the young people going out and make a difference, Clark said he could not just sit back and watch. Carrying a sign that said 'Am I next?' along with odes to Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement, Clark marched with his wife and her sister, continuing the example that those younger than him set. "I've allowed myself so many times in my life to believe it couldn't happen to me because I'm educated, I speak a certain way, if I get pulled over, it's going be 'Yes sir, No sir' — my objective is to go home,” Clark said. "'Am I next?' makes it real to me.” Next steps John Nemick has lived in the Plymouth area for more than 40 years. He has seen his share of rallies and people congregating in Kellogg Park. But to him, it was nothing like this. "This is people walking and doing something for a good cause, and it's good to see that the community turns out like this,” Nemick said. Watching signs referencing white privilege, Nemick, a white man, said Plymouth is the kind of town being referred to. "You know, the clock tower in the middle of town, the small-town feel, the nice restaurants,” Nemick said. "And it's not that it's our fault. It doesn't have to be your fault to want to change how the system operates.Nemick said he is hopeful, watching as the protests stretch from cities to suburbs, hoping that with this, progress will be initiated. A woman carries a sign saying "Jesus wept" during Plymouth's Black Lives Matter protest. (Photo: Colin Gay | Hometown Life)However, he said it will take more than standing or marching. It will have to take action from those outside of the black community. "It's the job of people that look like you and me to do something about this so that people who don't look like you and me can, because unfortunately, their voice isn't heard,” Nemick said. Feeling fulfilledMorgan Stephens grew up in Plymouth-Canton. She went to Canton High School. But she said, at times, she did not feel at home because of her skin color. "People looking at you like you don't belong,” Stephens said. "It just sucks to go out in your own hometown and have people look at you like you are not a human. "I get that more in Canton than if I went to Detroit.” Morgan Stephens, a senior at Central Michigan, organized the protest in her hometown. (Photo: Colin Gay | Hometown Life)That is part of the reason why she set up the protest in the middle of downtown Plymouth: to give herself a voice she did not feel she had in a predominantly white community growing up. Heading into the protest, Stephens said she hopes she would help develop awareness, helping people in the community to speak out and to ignite change. "I want people in Plymouth-Canton to know things happen outside of Plymouth and Canton,” Stephens said. As the chanting and the raising of signs continued near the fountain in the middle of the park, Stephens found herself near the back as people began to disperse. She said she was pleasantly surprised by the turnout, well exceeding the 30-70 people she expected to come in the first place. More than that, Stephens felt she had started something in her hometown. "I feel full,” she said after the protest. "I feel like I fulfilled something.”Contact reporter Colin Gay at cgay@hometownlife.com or 248-330-6710. Follow him on Twitter @ColinGay17.
