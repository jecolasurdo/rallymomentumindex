RYAN REVOCK / STATESVILLE RECORD & LANDMARK Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Protesters lined the streets of downtown Mooresville on Friday evening, some holding "hands up don't shoot" signs, others wearing "Black Lives Matter" T-shirts.But the demonstration, which was escorted by Mooresville police, remained largely peaceful, unlike protests in Charlotte earlier this week. Organizers, who obtained permits from the town on Friday to hold the march, said that was the goal."We can't kill violence with violence," said Raynisha Caldwell, who applied for the permit after seeing hateful, racial comments from her Facebook friends, she said. She added, "We all deserve peace. We all deserve peace within ourselves and peace within our homes. We can't change everything but we can change ourselves. We can't go to Charlotte and we can't make a stand there but we're home and we will make a stand here."Participants gathered at the Moorseville Town Hall around 6 p.m. and set off on their march an hour later, traveling down Main Street and other downtown roads, which were blocked off by police for the march. Mooresville police lined the streets of the approved route, joined by units from the Iredell County Sheriff's Office, Davidson Police Department and Troutman Police Department.Mooresville Deputy Police Chief Bryan Anderson said law enforcement had contingency plans should violence, rioting, looting or other illegal activity break out. Anderson led the march, walking alongside Caldwell and other protestors.During the march, which was roughly one mile, protesters chanted "We want peace, not revenge." They also repeated phrases like "Hands up don't shoot," and "Who lives matter? All lives matter." Around 150 people in total joined in the march, including children and church leaders, both black and white.The march began and ended with prayers, with participants calling for peace, unity and change.Anderson said Mooresville had showed the rest of the nation that peaceful protests were possible, adding that he would "vigorously defend your right to protest.""We're you and you're us. The police are the community and the community is the police,"Anderson said to the gathered crowd. "We're all one."The march followed three days of protests in downtown Charlotte in response to the shooting death of a black man by a black Charlotte-Mecklenburg police officer. The National Guard had been called into that city earlier this week and the mayor enacted a curfew. Protesters in Mooresville joined those in Charlotte in demanding change regarding the policing of African-Americans and racial disparities in the criminal justice system."Some of these police need to stop trying to make a name for themselves," said Michelle Cherry, one of the marchers. "Stop trying to be John Wayne. Those days are gone. There's a lot of them that are trying to make a name for themselves. Stop trying to be better than us because you have a badge on. That don't make you better than us."Rita Thompson said she participated after hearing racists comments online which would ridicule stereotypical black behavior."I can't believe some of these comments, these hurtful comments," she said. "You know, I think some people are still living in the Jim Crow laws. People are going backward. This is the 21st century and we need to go forward."Her son, Michael Thompson Jr., who is a student at Western Carolina University, agreed, adding he hoped the march would send a symbolic statement to the community."It"s easy to hit Like on a post on Facebook or comment on a post but how many people will actually do something and come out here?" he asked.Tom Fyler, who identified himself as a member of the local Republican Party, said he participated to show his support for the cause. He said tension between black people and police in Charlotte stem from economic struggles, and he hoped that improving employment rates and decreasing poverty will ease those tensions.Once the march ended, the participants broke into applause and several thanked the police officers who were present. Caldwell, who embraced Anderson in a hug, called the event a success."Every person who came out here, you are all successful," Caldwell said. "You have all made a difference. Today was an amazing day."Others in Iredell County joined the call for peace on Friday. The Upper Room, a Christian teen group, met in the evening for a night of prayer in response to protests in Charlotte, according to its Facebook page.
