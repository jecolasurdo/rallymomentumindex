[Update: You can read our full report on the protests here.]Hundreds of people streamed into the Manhattan park on Thursday afternoon for the rally, where they were met with a massive and "aggressive" police presence, according to observers at the scene."It keeps flaring up. There's been about seven or eight arrests," photographer Dee Delgado told Gothamist. "I just witnessed an officer put his knee on somebody's neck."According to a police scanner, one officer was struck with a garbage can, and suffered minor injuries. NYPD confirms at least four taken into custody so far for civil disobedience during George Floyd protest at Union Square.@PIX11News pic.twitter.com/elYcfsaBNg— Cristian Benavides (@cbenavidesTV) May 28, 2020 Videos show protesters chanting "I Can't Breathe" — the final words of both Eric Garner and now Floyd, who died on Monday after a Minneapolis officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes.That officer seen in that video and three others involved in the lethal stop have since been fired (by comparison, it took more than five years for Garner's killer, Daniel Pantaleo, to lose his job; none of the other officers involved in Garner's death faced discipline.)The killing of Floyd has set off protests and riots — met with a heavy-handed police response — in Minneapolis over the last two nights. Other protests have since broken out in Los Angeles and Memphis. In a tweet on Thursday, NYPD Commissioner said that "what we saw in Minnesota was deeply disturbing," though it wasn't immediately clear if he was referring to the protests or Floyd's death. Separately, the NYPD's press office confirmed he was referring to Floyd's death, not the protests. What we saw in Minnesota was deeply disturbing. It was wrong. We must take a stand and address it.We must come together, condemn these actions and reinforce who we are as members of the NYPD.This is not acceptable ANYWHERE.— Commissioner Shea (@NYPDShea) May 28, 2020 NYC #BlackLivesMatter #nyc #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd #COVID19 #NewYork pic.twitter.com/TNlRu63nCC— Evann (@evannoseye) May 28, 2020 In addition to Thursday's protest, a "WE CAN'T BREATHE Rally + Vigil" is planned for Foley Square on Friday at 4 p.m., and another demonstration is being organized for Friday night outside Barclays Center in Brooklyn.Gatherings of more than ten people are still banned in New York City due to social distancing rules, and Mayor Bill de Blasio has said the NYPD will continue to enforce against large events. A spokesperson for the police department could not immediately provide the charges of the four people arrested.According to Delgado, a majority of the protesters were wearing masks. As of 6 p.m., the demonstration appeared to be "escalating," he said.
