"In California and across the country, there are indications that violent actors may be attempting to use these protests for their own agendas," Newsom said in the release. "We are closely monitoring organizing by violent extremist organizations ahead of tonight. To those who seek to exploit Californians' pain to sow chaos and destruction, you are not welcome." Original story: A large crowd gathered at the California Capitol Saturday morning to continue protesting the death of George Floyd, who died after being pinned for minutes beneath Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin's knee on Monday. Chauvin has since been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter for the death of Floyd. He and the other three officers involved in Floyd's arrest were fired Tuesday. On Facebook, Black Lives Matter Sacramento said in a comment that Saturday's protest was not organized by its organization. This comes a day after protestors marched in the Oak Park neighborhood of Sacramento. More than 100 people attended Friday night's gathering as a way to show solidarity with protesters in Minneapolis and across the country, after the death of Geroge Floyd in police custody. The Sacramento Police Department asked via Twitter that people avoid the downtown area, and to use alternate traffic routes, if possible. According to various media outlets, the protestors marched along K Street before heading to Old Sacramento and crossing the Tower Bridge into West Sacramento before turning around and heading back to the Capitol.

They did not say if anyone was arrested. No word if arrests. The protestors were peaceful and were escorted off, according to CHP.
