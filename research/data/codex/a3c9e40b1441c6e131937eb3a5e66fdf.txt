Several groups are asking for three streets signs in the city of Hollywood – Lee, Hood and Forest Streets – to be renamed. All three are named for those who fought for the states that seceded from the U.S. during the 1860's. Members of those groups wanting the change – including Take Down Slavery Symbols Hollywood and the Black Lives Matter Alliance Broward, gathered for a protest at city hall Wednesday before attending the city commission meeting at 1:30 p.m. and speaking during the public comment period at 5 p.m. Local Florida 1 hour ago DACA Victory Fuels TPS Holders' Efforts to Obtain Permanent Status coronavirus 2 hours ago Florida Governor Says Younger People Drive COVID-19 Surge Demonstrators chanted "Hey hey, ho ho, these racist street signs have got to go," and "No Forrest, No Lee, no street signs named for slavery." Various efforts have been made in the past to change the names, honoring Robert E. Lee, John Bell Hood and Nathan Bedford Forrest – who was also the first Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. Those who support the current street names were also on hand to counter protest. Five people were arrested for disrupting the commission meeting Wednesday. Several cities, including Orlando and New Orleans, have taken down statues in recent weeks commemorating the Confederacy after heated debate from both sides of the issue.
