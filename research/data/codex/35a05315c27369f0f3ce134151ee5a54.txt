"Our blood is flowing in the streets all the time,” said Lia Miller-Granger, an organizer of the rally. "People are afraid to be on their own block.” Belton was killed Saturday morning on Kensington Avenue, between Chapel Street and Edgewood Avenue, according to New Haven police. Friends have created a small memorial on the sidewalk where his body was found. People gathered at the rally Monday said Belton's nickname was "Stu.” A suspect has not been identified.

"We need to take back our streets.” About two-dozen Black Lives Matter supporters were in Kensington Park at 7 p.m. for the rally, despite the rain and lightning. "All black lives matter, whether we like them or not,” Miller-Granger said. "I can't fathom why it's OK to let my brother's blood run in the streets.” Advocates expressed frustration with city police Chief Dean Esserman, who has said many times that crime is down in the city. Miller-Granger said, with much support from the small crowd, that Esserman went to Washington, D.C., and told President Barack Obama lies last week about the state of crime in New Haven. There also is a lot of unreported crime in the city, Catherine John, a Black Lives Matter advocate, said during the rally. John said she is a single mother and due to her work schedule, her son often needs to go to school alone, and she fears for his safety every day. She added that it's not right that the neighborhood's children are used to hearing gunshots. Both women agreed, the correct response to black-on-black crime is to take back control of the neighborhood and look out for each other. "You can't let the vagrants of the community control (it),” Miller-Granger said.
