BLM LA The peaceful demonstration of more than 50,000 people began Sunday on Hollywood Blvd ... and the aerial views were epic. YG teamed up with BLM LA and joined activist and BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors at the front of the crowd to share some words and explain the importance of using his voice.

Mayor Eric Garcetti. Lizzo, Kehlani and Common were among those who marched ... it was shortly after that protest when Garcetti announced an enormous, $150 million cut, from the LAPD's budget. Of course, the L.A. protests were not the only ones over the weekend ... as several major cities and small towns in the U.S. kept the demonstrations going in a continued show of support for ending systemic racism and police brutality.
