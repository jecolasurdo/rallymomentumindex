"I worry about him every day because of what's going on and how is it, they see me as a white woman and him as a black man. Its not fair, we need to be together." Her son, Josiah, said he was out in the streets because he was tired of his mom worrying about him whenever he left the house. "I shouldn't have to worry if I'm white, brown, black, purple, green," he said. "Doesn't matter. I want to feel safe and hang out and do what I want without police looking at me because I'm a certain color."

On Tuesday, officers with the El Cajon Police Department (ECPD) shot and killed Alfred Olango, a Ugandan refugee, during an encounter in the parking lot of a shopping center in the 800 block of Broadway. Police said Olango was reported to be "acting erratically" and did not follow orders to remove his hands from the pockets of his pants. Police said at one point he pulled an object from his pants and pointed it at officers in a "shooting stance." Authorities later revealed the object was a vaping device. The killing of Olango sparked outrage in the community amid racial tensions nationwide stemming from deadly police shootings of unarmed black men.

You guys are doing your jobs." "You may not be part of it, but your buddies are," another man shouted at law enforcement officers. "It's time to expose everybody." A man wearing a shirt with the words #BlackLives tried to walk across the line formed by law enforcement but was quickly stopped by a deputy. The man shouted that he was trying to get to his son on the other side of the line. "Stop! Go back!” the deputy told the man. "Are you kidding me?” the man asked the deputy. "You wonder why we gotta problem with you all? Are you serious?” "Is not following police orders a justification for killing? This is Murder," said Christopher Rice-Wilson, the Associate Director at Alliance San Diego who was one of the protesters. Olango emigrated to the U.S. in 1991 when he was 12 years old.
