(WLNE) – Hundreds of people attended a Black Lives Matter protest in South Kingstown Tuesday that was led by youth in town. Protesters filled Kingstown Road around 1 p.m. and marched across town, ending back at Old Mountain Field where people took a knee for 8 minutes and 46 seconds of silence to honor George Floyd. "I wanted to organize something in South Kingstown because I personally couldn't go to Providence, my parents wouldn't let me,” said Abby Dech, one of the organizers. When Dech and her friends decided to put on the protest, they had no idea how many people would show up. "It's crazy when I posted the poll I had 32 people saying they wanted to attend, so when all of these people showed up it was kinda surreal.” HAPPENING NOW: #BlackLivesMatter protest in South Kingstown, RI. Hundreds just marched around the town and are stopping at Old Mountain Field to take a knee. @ABC6 pic.twitter.com/HFRWm6kWsL — Amanda Pitts (@APittsABC6) June 9, 2020 Protesters of all ages showed up with signs, lining Kingstown Road to get the attention of drivers passing by. One of the youngest protesters was 12-year-old Diyani Mitchell-Sims who marched with her mom and brother. "We need to get justice for George Floyd, so that's what we're doing by having a peaceful protest and holding up signs cause black lives do matter. Black lives matter, like black men and black women and even black children like me and my little brother. We need justice and we don't deserve to be treated this way.” A funeral for George Floyd was held Tuesday afternoon, and many protesters watched beforehand. Jean Bowen of South Kingstown said Floyd's final words struck a chord with her. "I'm especially moved by Mr. Floyd's last call for his mom. It's very touching, very powerful for all mothers. He called on his mom at the last moment of his life, and it has brought us all out to stand up for justice for George and all the other black men and women who've been killed,” said Bowen. South Kingstown Police led the group of protesters through town and watched on until they wrapped up around 3 p.m. One officer was seen taking a knee with the protesters.

"There's so many black and brown people here and we face so much racism and prejudice here, you know... I think it's really important for us to stick together especially right now.” © WLNE-TV 2020 Categories: Coronavirus, News, Regional News, Rhode Island Tags: Black Lives Matter, Protest, Rhode Island, South Kingstown FacebookPinterestTwitterLinkedin Related Providence restaurant has delivered 4,400 meals to health care workers throughout pandemic Nearly all indoor venues, weddings, parties allowed to resume with limits in Phase 3 Experts predict 1 in 5 restaurants will close due to coronavirus pandemic The Latest: WHO chief warns virus pandemic 'accelerating' Most Viewed URI sorority suspended due to racist videoStrip clubs allowed to reopen in Providence without touching, entertainment must be outsidePolice: 1 in critical condition following fight between two roommates in ProvidencePawtucket mom finds son's body in river, says police didn't do enoughBristol to hold drive-by July 4 parade Featured Coronavirus News and ResourcesABC6 Half Off DealsSouthern New England Experts Email Alert Signup Sign up for our Breaking News email alerts! * indicates required Email Address * First Name Last Name NewsNews Local News Regional News US & World News Entertainment News Special Reports Submit Your News Special ReportsThe Opioid Crisis Our Schools Local NewsProvidence New Bedford Fall River Woonsocket Warwick Pawtucket Cranston Newport Attleboro Regional NewsRhode Island Massachusetts WeatherWeather 7-Day Forecast Weather Radar Closings & Delays Flight Tracker Power Outages Your Weather Photos Ski Reports TrafficTraffic Traffic Map SportsSports ABC6 Sports Team Play of the Week CommunityCommunity Event Calendar ABC6 Contests Southern New England Gas Tracker Southern New England Experts WatchWatch Live News TV Schedule Video AboutAbout ABC6 News Team Advertise With Us Careers Closed Captioning DMCA Agent FCC Public File FCC Applications Children's TV Report EEO Report Standard Media Group Privacy Policy Terms of Use © 2020 ABC6. © Copyright 2020 WLNE Providence Operations, LLC - A Standard Media Company - All Rights Reserved Close Share Toggle Fullscreen Zoom in/out Previous Next
