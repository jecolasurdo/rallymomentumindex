"I think the time is now for George Floyd's life to matter”."We are here to peacefully support George Floyd's family and let everyone know that we just need to come together,” Lane said. "We are not here to denounce the police. We actually want to create a sense of unity between us and them.”They had a clear message that Black Lives Matter. "Black lives matter because black lives are just as important as any other walk of life or visited earth and we need more than just the people that were here today to see that," said local activist Marquis Graham.For today at least, it didn't matter who you were or where you were from, people made their voices heard. "Once you realize if the person next to you is like feeling the same things you're feeling it's definitely a huge sense of community and hopefully we're doing something," said activist Skyla Williams."You know I have an eight and a 10-year-old child and on the way over here today we were talking about what we were coming into Gainesville to do and what it meant," said Newberry Mayor Jordan Marlowe. "I was telling them that if we had been alive in the 60's, we would've walked with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we would have been a part of that so we were going to be a part of this today."Latest NewsNewsFollowing athletes, NCAA takes aim at Confederate flagUpdated: 33 minutes ago|By Ralph D.
