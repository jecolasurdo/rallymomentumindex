"I think the time is now for George Floyd's life to matter”."We are here to peacefully support George Floyd's family and let everyone know that we just need to come together,” Lane said. "We are not here to denounce the police. We actually want to create a sense of unity between us and them.”They had a clear message that Black Lives Matter. "Black lives matter because black lives are just as important as any other walk of life or visited earth and we need more than just the people that were here today to see that," said local activist Marquis Graham.For today at least, it didn't matter who you were or where you were from, people made their voices heard. "Once you realize if the person next to you is like feeling the same things you're feeling it's definitely a huge sense of community and hopefully we're doing something," said activist Skyla Williams."You know I have an eight and a 10-year-old child and on the way over here today we were talking about what we were coming into Gainesville to do and what it meant," said Newberry Mayor Jordan Marlowe. "I was telling them that if we had been alive in the 60's, we would've walked with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we would have been a part of that so we were going to be a part of this today."Latest NewsNews Juneteenth March for FreedomUpdated: 3 hours ago|By Amber PelliconeThe Gator Chapter of the NAACP will lead their March for Freedom to celebrate Juneteenth.NewsGainesville City Commission wants mugshots and "perp walks” done away withUpdated: 13 hours agoGainesville City Commission approve measure to request mugshots and "perp walks" be done away with by Alachua County Sheriff Sadie DarnellNews Hundreds gather at Gainesville city hall for a Black Communities Matter rallyUpdated: 13 hours ago|By Ruelle FluddHundreds gathered to learn about the history of Gainesville's black communities and take action to preserve them.NewsHundreds gather at Gainesville City Hall for a Black Communities Matter rallyUpdated: 13 hours ago|By Ruelle FluddThousands gathered to learn the history of Black in Gainesville and take action on how to preserve them.News Orchid Cove hosts parade for senior residentsUpdated: 14 hours agoFamilies drove to north central Florida today to see their relatives during a nursing home parade.Latest NewsNewsMarion County residents find hand grenade on their propertyUpdated: 14 hours ago|By WCJB StaffThe reason for the hand grenade being on the property is unknownNews Elder Options receives $10K grantUpdated: 14 hours agoElder Options in Alachua County received a $10,000 grant from the Women's Giving circle" of the Community Foundation of North Central Florida to help senior women who are living alone become more connected.NewsColumbia County commissioners vote to table noise ordinance proposalUpdated: 14 hours agoThe county may soon get a noise ordinance, but it will have to wait a little while longer.News Newberry Watermelon Festival planned for SaturdayUpdated: 15 hours ago|By Landon HarrarThe tradition will not be canceled due to COVID-19NewsLake City Police seek missing teenUpdated: 19 hours agoLake City Police is asking for your help to locate a missing teen.They say 13-year-old Isabella Sapp was last seen with another teenager, 14-year-old Kelcie Woolf.
