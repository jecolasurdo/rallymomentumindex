The protests against what several players believe to be social injustice were started last season by former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who remains an unsigned free agent. Here are the players who protested:Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett sits during the playing of the national anthem next to center Justin Britt on Thursday in Oakland, California. Eric Risberg/AP PhotoWeek 4Buffalo Bills: Bills reserve offensive lineman Cameron Jefferson raised his right fist during the entirety of the national anthem prior to Thursday's preseason finale against the Detroit Lions. It is the third consecutive game he has done so. He first made his protest during an Aug. 17 preseason game against the Philadelphia Eagles in which he was inspired by Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins' protest across the field. -- Mike RodakOakland Raiders: Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch remained seated during the national anthem for the fourth straight week. -- Paul GutierrezSeattle Seahawks: For the third straight week, defensive lineman Michael Bennett sat on the bench during the national anthem while center Justin Britt stood next to him with a hand on Bennett's shoulder. -- Paul GutierrezSan Francisco 49ers: After his change of heart last week, Niners safety Eric Reid followed through on his promise to continue kneeling during the national anthem in protest of racial inequality before Thursday's game against the Los Angeles Chargers. Teammates Reuben Foster, Marquise Goodwin, Tim Hightower, Eli Harold, Shayne Skov, Rashard Robinson and Dontae Johnson surrounded him in support. Reid was the first player to join Colin Kaepernick's protest in the 2016 preseason. Coincidentally, Reid first knelt before the fourth preseason game last year, also against the Chargers. Reid is not in uniform as the Niners are resting all but one of their starters in the preseason finale. -- Nick WagonerWeek 3San Francisco 49ers: Safety Eric Reid resumed kneeling during the anthem before Sunday night's game against the Minnesota Vikings. Reid knelt with teammates such as Marquise Goodwin, Eli Harold and Lorenzo Jerome placing a hand on his shoulder. Reid, of course, knelt with Kaepernick during the entire 2016 season but said repeatedly that he wasn't going to resume his protest this season, though he planned to continue to help the cause in other ways. He said after the game he had a change of heart. -- Nick WagonerLos Angeles Rams: Outside linebacker Robert Quinn raised his fist during the national anthem, something he began doing last year and plans to stick to throughout the 2017 season. Rams coach Sean McVay said earlier this week that he took a page out of Jeff Fisher's playbook with regards to how the team sets up for the anthem, with players lining up along the sideline and the coaching staff lining up behind them. Quinn wanted to honor McVay's wishes of standing while making his own statement. -- Alden GonzalezAround 30 Browns players locked arms during the national anthem played before Saturday's preseason game in Tampa.

EbenhackCleveland Browns: About 30 Cleveland Browns players stood arm-to-arm in a line during the national anthem before Saturday night's preseason game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The players stood in front of the Browns' bench. -- Pat McManamonOakland Raiders: Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch stayed seated during the national anthem for the third straight week. -- Todd ArcherBuffalo Bills: Backup offensive lineman Cameron Jefferson raised his right fist in the air during the national anthem for the second straight week. After the anthem ended, he then tapped his heart. This is the second straight week that Jefferson has done this. Last game against the Philadelphia Eagles, Jefferson said he was inspired to raise his fist after looking across the field at Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins doing the same during the anthem. -- Jamison HensleySeattle Seahawks: For the second straight week, defensive lineman Michael Bennett sat on the bench during the national anthem while center Justin Britt stood next to him with a hand on Bennett's shoulder. Defensive end Cliff Avril took a seat next to Bennett for the last few seconds of the anthem. Cornerback Jeremy Lane, who last week stood with his back to the field during the anthem, stood facing the field this time. -- Mike SandoPhiladelphia Eagles: Safety Malcolm Jenkins continued his protest by raising a fist over his head prior to the Eagles' home game against the Miami Dolphins on Thursday night. Defensive end Chris Long, as he did last week prior to the preseason game against the Buffalo Bills, kept his hand on Jenkins' back for the entire playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner," and then Long gave him a hug when the song was over in a show of support. Safety Rodney McLeod put a hand on Jenkins' shoulder as well. Cornerback Ron Brooks took a knee during the anthem for a second straight week. "Especially after Charlottesville, I couldn't not do anything," he said this week. Brooks joined Jenkins in raising a fist for multiple weeks last season before being sidelined with a ruptured quad tendon. He said he decided to take a knee rather than put a fist in the air because he believes it will offend less people, allowing more focus to be on the issue of social injustice rather than the form of protest. He told ESPN that he plans on demonstrating every week this season. -- Tim McManusWeek 2Cleveland Browns: Eleven Cleveland Browns players took a knee in a circle during the national anthem before Monday's preseason game. While the group knelt behind the bench in front of the Gatorade buckets, several other players stood nearby and put their hands on a kneeling teammate's shoulder in support.Those who took a knee were tight end Seth DeValve, running backs Duke Johnson Jr. and Terrence Magee, safeties Jabrill Peppers and Calvin Pryor, cornerback Jamar Taylor, receivers Kenny Britt and Ricardo Louis, linebackers Christian Kirksey and Jamie Collins, and running back Isaiah Crowell (who was not in uniform).Those who stood nearby were punter Britton Colquitt (who also had his hand on his heart), cornerback Jason McCourty, quarterback DeShone Kizer, defensive tackle Trevon Coley and offensive tackle Shon Coleman. -- Pat McManamonPhiladelphia Eagles: Safety Malcolm Jenkins continued his protest by raising a fist over his head prior to the Eagles' home game against the Buffalo Bills. In an apparent show of support, defensive end Chris Long kept his hand on Jenkins' back for the entire playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner." Then Long gave Jenkins a pat on the shoulder pads and a hug when the song was over. Cornerback Ron Brooks was also seen taking a knee during the anthem. Brooks joined Jenkins in raising a fist for multiple weeks last season before being sidelined with a ruptured quad tendon. -- Tim McManusLos Angeles Rams: Outside linebacker Robert Quinn raised his fist in the air during the national anthem Saturday, as he did in the first preseason game and throughout the 2016 regular season. Quinn spoke to new Rams coach Sean McVay about his intent beforehand, saying he wanted to express himself while respecting McVay's wishes that everybody stand. "It's not just a stance, but an appreciation to ancestors who made a way for, and gave opportunities for, me and others that came along the way," Quinn told reporters earlier this week. "It's more of an appreciation than a stance, that not all has been forgotten." -- Alden GonzalezFor the second preseason game this season, Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch sat during the national anthem. Rich Pedroncelli/AP PhotoOakland Raiders: Quarterback Derek Carr put his right hand on defensive end Khalil Mack's left shoulder during the national anthem before the Raiders' exhibition home opener against the Rams on Saturday night. Also, a week after remaining seated on a cooler in Arizona, Raiders running back Marshawn Lynch again stayed seated. Plus, Raiders rookie safety Shalom Luani took a knee at the beginning of the anthem. -- Paul GutierrezSeattle Seahawks: For the second straight week, Michael Bennett sat for the national anthem. Seahawks center Justin Britt stood next to Bennett with his hand on Bennett's right shoulder, and the two hugged after the anthem. Seahawks cornerback Jeremy Lane stood facing Bennett with his back to the flag and the field.-- Sheil KapadiaTennessee Titans: Following the national anthem sung before the Titans' game against the visiting Panthers on Saturday, defensive lineman Jurrell Casey and linebacker Wesley Woodyard raised their firsts in the air. Both Casey and Woodyard did the same last season.-- Cameron WolfeBuffalo Bills: Bills offensive lineman Cameron Jefferson raised his fist during the anthem before their game against the Philadelphia Eagles on Thursday. Jefferson said he was inspired to raise his fist after looking across the field at Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins doing the same during Thursday's anthem. Bills coach Sean McDermott said Sunday he respects Jefferson's decision. "What I want all of our players to understand is we are going to support them, No. 1," McDermott said. "Everyone obviously has their view on things. I think the key word here is respect. We respect Cam's opinion, we respect and acknowledge what's going on. ... Respect the situation, respect the communication end of things moving forward, and then respect the process of what's going on in this country and in this world."-- Mike RodakWeek 1Philadelphia Eagles: Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins continued his protest of social injustice Thursday by raising a fist over his head during the playing of the national anthem before the team's preseason home game against the Buffalo Bills. In a show of support, defensive end Chris Long kept his hand on Jenkins' back for the entire playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner," then gave Jenkins a pat on the shoulder pads and a hug when the song was over. -- Tim McManusLos Angeles Rams: Outside linebacker Robert Quinn raised his fist in the air during the national anthem, as he did throughout the 2016 regular season. -- Alden GonzalezOakland Raiders: Marshawn Lynch appeared to stage a silent protest in his return to the NFL, as the Oakland Raiders running back remained seated during the national anthem prior to the team's 20-10 loss to the Arizona Cardinals. Photos show Lynch, who suited up but did not play, sitting on a cooler while holding a banana during the anthem. -- Paul GutierrezSeattle Seahawks: Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett sat with a towel over his head during the national anthem on Sunday before his team took on the Los Angeles Chargers in the preseason opener for both teams at the StubHub Center.Bennett's action came a day after his former teammate, running back Marshawn Lynch, did something similar before the Oakland Raiders' exhibition opener on the road against the Arizona Cardinals on Saturday. -- Sheil Kapadia FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmail
