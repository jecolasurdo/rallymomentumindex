Levi Dent. This story has been updated.Pastor John Swann asked the people in the pews to whisper the nine names listed in a program while he spoke. "Someone has lost a father, someone has lost a mother, someone has lost a brother, a sister, someone has lost an aunt, an uncle, someone has lost a best friend, someone has lost a spouse,” he said.Like other African Methodist Episcopal churches around the country holding vigils, about 40 people gathered at the Bethel AME Church in Cave Spring to remember the six women and three men who lost their lives in a shooting at a historic black church in South Carolina. Religious leaders inside the cozy church emphasized unity and prayer to overcome evil and fear.See more: Vigil to remember victims in Charleston shootings"Even in the midst of these tragedies, we have a God we can worship and praise together,” Deacon Kenneth Belton said.The suspect in the shooting at the "Mother” Emanuel AME Church in Charleston is Dylann Roof, 21, of Lexington, North Carolina. The young white man was arrested about 200 miles away during a traffic stop following a 14-hour manhunt. Reverends asked the flock to pray not only for the victims but also for Roof."I'm praying for the victims' families, and I'm also praying for the young man and his family, and hopefully he can get some help,” said Pamela White, who sat within the crowd.The Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, the FBI, and the United States Attorney's Office for South Carolina have opened a hate crime investigation into the shooting. Police said Roof walked into a prayer meeting Wednesday night and sat for an hour before opening fire. Among the dead was the Rev. Clementa C. Pinckney, pastor of the church, who was also a state senator. The atmosphere of the Bethel AME Church was mostly mournful, but it was frequently punctuated by resilience and hopefulness. Charleston's Emanuel AME Church has a long history of struggle, resistance and perseverance. It arose out of discrimination, was burned to the ground out of a hatred and was born again.Daniela Swann, Pastor Swann's wife, stressed those affected by this tragedy will once again forge ahead like those before them."God, there's power in the blood. You still reign,” she said. "We come together with the love you taught is in the Bible.”"Amen” and "yes” burst from mouths in the audience as the Rev. Elsie Wright read Psalm 37, urging "Let us not fret because of evildoers ... but trust in the Lord and do good.” Among those in attendance were state Sen. John Edwards, Roanoke City Councilman Dave Trinkle, Mike Hamlar, the Democratic candidate vying for the 19th Senate District seat, and Brenda Hale, president of the Roanoke branch of the NAACP."When we first heard this last night, I was in utter shock and disbelief that this could happen in 2015, in an African-American church,” Hale said. "But we've got to stand together and pray for our brothers and sisters as an homage to them.”Hamlar said the tragedy has been a hard one to comprehend, but he said it's important to stress that people should not be scared to go to their place of worship."It's a reminder we have a long way to go with the hatred that is still there,” Hamlar said. "But I believe God will get us there.”The Rev. Amy Ziglar, with the Mount Zion AME Church in Roanoke, said afterward she wanted the vigil to show that the religious community should emphasize that comfort and prayer, not violence, were preferred in the aftermath of the shooting.The crowd joined Ziglar in reciting Psalm 23, "The Lord is my Shepherd,” before she asked that people continue to pray for the shooting victims, their families, friends and people they surrounded themselves with."The state of Virginia lifts up the state of South Carolina,” Ziglar said.
