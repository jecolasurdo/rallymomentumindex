People began arriving at San Luis Obispo City Hall at 2 p.m., and the number of protesters continued to grow. San Luis Obispo Police Chief Deanna Cantrell was also on scene and was seen speaking to people in the area. Protesters brought signs with slogans and gathered at the steps of City Hall to hear speeches from the march organizers. One of the speakers said to keep an eye out for instigators and intervene if necessary in order to ensure Wednesday's protest remained peaceful. Following this, they began their way through the streets of downtown San Luis Obispo chanting "No justice, no peace," which has become a rally cry of sorts for protesters across the country.
