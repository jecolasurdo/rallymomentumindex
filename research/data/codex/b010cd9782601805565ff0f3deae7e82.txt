Ft. Hood Street at 7pm.Hundreds of people gathered for a night of songs and speeches, and the chance to express the pain so many in this community have felt this week.The organizers said on Facebook "this is a peaceful protest and march. Bring your mask." "We just wanna make sure that they know that as soon as we start tearing stuff up, our purpose is gone," said Reshard Hicks, one of the organizers."It's to spark a community conversation here in Killeen, Texas. We've got an opportunity to have the police there, have local officials there and begin the conversation."The protest was filled with people of all ages and races. "I think that when you live here you can count on all different people's cultures having your back and I think that's one of the things that this shows. We are not a community that is divided. We are a community that is there to support one another," said Shelley Huckins. The group was also working to affect practical change in the community by helping protesters register to vote, saying the biggest change they can make comes this fall.Protests and anger over the death of George Floyd spread to dozens of cities across the country this weekend. The 46-year-old died in police custody in Minneapolis after an officer pressed his knee on the man's neck during his arrest last Monday.Derek Chauvin, the officer seen kneeling on Floyd's neck, was arrested on murder and manslaughter charges on Friday. He and three other officers involved in the incident have since been fire by the Minneapolis Police Department. Copyright 2020 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
