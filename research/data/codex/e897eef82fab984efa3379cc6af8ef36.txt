Advertisement Breaking News News 2 arrested during Chicago protest By Megan Crepeau Chicago Tribune | Aug 12, 2015 | 3:51 AM "Black Lives Matter" written in chalk near a Chicago Police Department building on Aug. 11, 2015. (Megan Crepeau, Chicago Tribune) Police arrested and briefly detained two men for inhibiting the flow of traffic during a protest Tuesday night, authorities confirmed. Demonstrators met near Chicago police headquarters Tuesday in solidarity with protesters in Ferguson, Mo., where demonstrations marking the death of Michael Brown have continued for the past few days. Brown was killed in Ferguson last year by a police officer, and his death sparked protests nationwide. "There's a state of emergency in black America today,” said organizer Temara "Jaz” Jasmine, 27. The protest began near Chicago police headquarters Tuesday. At about 8 p.m., the two men were detained and cited, according to Officer Amina Greer, a Chicago police spokeswoman. Jasmine said she saw police in the street arrest one man after telling him to stay on the sidewalk. "The police have a legal monopoly on so much,” she said. "They were going to be in the streets while keeping us on the sidewalk?” After the arrests, the demonstrators marched to 2nd District headquarters at 5101 S. Wentworth Ave., where the two men were being detained. They waited outside until the men were released later that night.
