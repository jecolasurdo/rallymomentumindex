"It is supportive of our core values to pursue accountability, through due process, for an egregious assault on our community that has caused considerable harm,” UConn President Thomas Katsouleas said in a statement late Monday night. "I'm grateful for the university's collective effort in responding to this incident, especially the hard work of the UConn Police Department, which has been investigating the case since it was reported.” The announcement of the arrests came just hours after students gathered to protest and march outside the Student Union on Monday afternoon, chanting "it's more than just a word” and "our voices will be heard,” before impassioned speeches by professors and students. The university chapter of the NAACP also demanded school officials disband a fraternity where a second incident of alleged racial discrimination took place, update the university's student code of conduct regarding hate speech, hire a slate of new black staff members and implement a new mandatory diversity course. "As representatives for students of color on this campus, we are on high alert,” the group wrote to administrators in a letter published Monday by the student newspaper, The Daily Campus. "If the university does not adequately address and handle these occurrences of racism appropriately, it will create a culture in which racism is tolerated and normalized.” Several hundred UConn students participated in a rally at UConn in front of the Student Union Monday calling on administrative action in response to the video that surfaced last week of a group of students walking past a black student's dorm using racial slurs and laughing.

It was followed a day later by allegations made by another student that two members of the Delta Epsilon Psi fraternity called her a racial slur at a party. Katsouleas condemned the incident outside the apartments in a letter to students late last week and announced a nationwide search for the university's next chief diversity officer, an administrator tasked specifically with addressing issues of inclusion on campus. "This search is being launched in the wake of a recent racist incident near the Charter Oak residence halls on the Storrs campus,” Katsouleas wrote. "This, or any similar incident, is deplorable and antithetical to the values of our community and the university as a whole. It has no place on our campuses — or anywhere.” Katsouleas briefly addressed the crowd gathered Monday with a bullhorn. "I'm really here to listen and to learn from you,” he said. "I'm also here to show you my support. My message to the world is that if you are not for equality and respect then I am not for you.” Storrs, Ct. - 10/21/2019 - UCConn president Thomas Katsouleas stands with students demonstrating at UConn today in response to a recent video showing white students in the Charter Oak apartments parking using racial slurs and laughing about it as they walked past black students' apartments.
