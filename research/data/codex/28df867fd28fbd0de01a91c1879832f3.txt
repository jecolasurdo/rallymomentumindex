(Provided) Samuel DuBose (file) CINCINNATI (FOX19) - Black Lives Matter demonstrators marched across the Purple People Bridge after supporters of Ray Tensing called off their vigil at the last minute. Despite the cancellation, a small group of Tensing supporters prayed in a circle at Sawyer Point then walked across the bridge. "Due to the ongoing threat for violence and personal attacks we regret that the Purple People Bridge vigil for Ray Tensing will be canceled," the post begins. Murder and voluntary manslaughter charges were formally dropped Monday against the former University of Cincinnati police officer in the fatal shooting of a motorist during a 2015 traffic stop. Tensing supporters made shirts reading "Tensing Proud" and "Support the Blue." They also planned to hold a prayer for Tensing and the family of Samuel DuBose, an organizer said. [Thousands sign 'Free Ray Tensing' petition] Tensing is aware of the support march, but will not be attending, his attorney told the Cincinnati Enquirer. Previous protests, including the recent one Saturday on Fountain Square, were peaceful with no arrests. After two mistrials, DuBose's family has called for a third murder trial against Tensing. But the prosecutor announced last week that his office won't be seeking a third trial. The Department of Justice is now reviewing all evidence, including some not permitted in court, to see if they will pursue a civil rights violation case against Tensing.
