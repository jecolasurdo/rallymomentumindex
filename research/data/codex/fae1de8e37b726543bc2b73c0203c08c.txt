Their mistakes could have led to disaster. Coronavirus trends have MN schools on track to reopen this fall, officials say Coronavirus Friday update: 17 more Minnesota deaths and 356 new cases On a hot and humid pregame sidewalk, the color of choice for many Minnesota Lynx fans Friday was black. They were participating in #BlackOutLynx, an open invitation to wear black in solidarity with Lynx players who donned black July 9 after the police shootings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling and the subsequent killing of five police officers in Dallas. The team took some backlash from Minneapolis police who believed team members were rushing to judgment on the Castile and Sterling cases. Four off-duty officers hired to do security for the Lynx that night walked off the job. Fans also were protesting the WNBA's decision to fine the Indiana Fever, New York Liberty and Phoenix Mercury for wearing black shirts in warm-ups after being warned that it was against league rules. The teams were fined $5,000 each and players had $500 taken out of their paychecks. Ryoji Suguro said he came out with a group of friends all in black specifically in reaction to the police walkout. Jade Denson said she's a women's basketball fan anyway, but she wore black Friday in appreciation of the players' actions. #LosLynx fans were in black tonight for#BlackOutLynx.

Some of the people wearing black received tickets from supporters of the effort. Others were longtime fans and season ticket holders who made it a point to wear black to Friday's game against the Seattle Storm. Charlie Quimby said he has been coming to Lynx games from the beginning.

Fightback2015 Who's the little shlump sitting on the end with his mouth open? Probably only came to the Stinks game because his big sister told him he could score.
