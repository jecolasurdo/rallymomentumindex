By the time the crowd had made the 2.5-mile trek from Centennial Olympic Park to the state capitol, hundreds had joined in.The protest Friday afternoon through downtown Atlanta started out mostly peaceful, but the message was strong. The participants, most clad in masks and social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19 embarked from Centennial Olympic Park at 3:50 pm on their way to the capital to protest the killing of George Floyd. They chanted "no justice, no peace,” but when a motorcycle battalion of police officers road by, they switched to "Don't Shoot.”Lamont Wilson, 34, asks the question: "Am I next,” during the rally.

"But I fear for the young brothers. We focus on the killings but there is so much injustice that comes before that too.”The crowd was notably diverse, from a black woman doing the full march in a motorized wheel chair to a middle-aged white man carrying a sign reading, "I AM A THUG,” to a young Hispanic man blasting KRS-ONE's "Sound of Da Police,” from a speaker in his pocket. Atlanta native Clarissa Nelson was overwhelmed by the crowds Friday afternoon. The 64-year-old said she'd didn't expect to see a diverse march like this in support of Black lives. "I'm full. I'm just thrilled that multiple people are in support of one.” pic.twitter.com/8ytViolKFQ— Raisa Habersham (@newsworthy17) May 29, 2020 Atlanta's top cop responds Atlanta's police chief said the Minneapolis officers involved in the death of Floyd failed both as "cops and human beings.”In a two-minute video posted on the department's social media pages, Chief Erika Shields said the behavior is not indicative of the entire law enforcement community. "How disconnected does law enforcement have to be for a man to be suffocated by a cop in broad daylight, knowing the cameras are rolling with fellow officers stand around watching?” Shields said. "There's not an answer to this because it's not reasonable in any sense of the word.” Atlanta Police Chief Erika Shields addresses the death of #GeorgeFloyd at the hands of police officers. Chief Shields expresses a deep frustration knowing the officers didn't just fail as cops, they fundamentally failed as human beings.

Vice President Pence addresses shooting At a stop at the Unity National Bank in Atlanta, a minority owned bank, Vice President Mike Pence briefly addressed the deaths of George Floyd in Minnesota and Ahmaud Arbery in coastal Georgia. "Our prayers are with George Floyd's family. Our prayers are also with the family of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia. "We have no tolerance for racism in America. We have no tolerance for violence inspired by racism. And as President Trump said, justice will be served.” He added: "We also believe in law and order in this country. We condemn violence against property or persons. We will also always stand for the right of Americans to peacefully protest and let their voices be heard.”— Greg Bluestein — Please return to ajc.com for updates as the march gets under way.
