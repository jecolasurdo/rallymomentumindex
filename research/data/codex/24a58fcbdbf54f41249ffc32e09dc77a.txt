By Laura Rodríguez Presa Chicago Tribune | Jun 04, 2020 | 4:03 PM Latino and black Chicagoans organized Wednesday on the Southwest Side to denounce reports of violence against black people in Latino neighborhoods after protests and looting followed George Floyd's killing in Minneapolis. Many joined peace marches and engaged in other collective actions throughout the city in an attempt to begin the dismantling of the anti-black narrative and avoid more violence between the two communities.

Laura Ramirez, one of the organizers, said the march was intended to show black people that they are welcome in Latino communities, but also to urge Latinos to acknowledge the historical racism instilled in the community because it could halt them from moving forward in unity to continue fighting the system.

"I'm tired of the racism, but also of the violence in the neighborhood,” Bahena said in Spanish. While she praises and thanks those who helped to keep the neighborhood safe from looters, she also acknowledged that "unfortunately, some felt the need to spread violence.” In Pilsen, a predominantly Latino neighborhood, a collective of diverse artists volunteered to paint murals over the boarded storefronts on 18th Street with messages in support of Black Live Matter.
