'Don't let them divide us.' By Laura Rodríguez Presa Chicago Tribune | Jun 04, 2020 | 4:03 PM Latino and black Chicagoans organized Wednesday on the Southwest Side to denounce reports of violence against black people in Latino neighborhoods after protests and looting followed George Floyd's killing in Minneapolis. Many joined peace marches and engaged in other collective actions throughout the city in an attempt to begin the dismantling of the anti-black narrative and avoid more violence between the two communities.

Laura Ramirez, one of the organizers, said the march was intended to show black people that they are welcome in Latino communities, but also to urge Latinos to acknowledge the historical racism instilled in the community because it could halt them from moving forward in unity to continue fighting the system.

Marchers chanted in English and Spanish while street vendors set up shop and other residents looked on. Two old high school friends who hadn't seen each other for years walked together with their fists in the air holding a Black Liberation flag and a Mexican flag. One of the young men had a speaker with Bob Marley's song "Is This Love” playing the lyrics "I want to love you, and treat you right.” "I knew I had to be here today because I know that hate sentiment does not align with all Latino immigrant workers,” said Terry Rudd, a black woman from West Englewood. Rudd blamed the spark of the violence on gang members and a corrupt Chicago Police Department. "They want to try to divide us; don't let them divide us,” she said.

Gang members need to put their guns down. We do not and will never tolerate attacks against anyone.” Little Village resident Maria Bahena attended the march with her daughter. "I'm tired of the racism, but also of the violence in the neighborhood,” Bahena said in Spanish.
