"Year after year. Day after day. Black and brown people are being murdered in this country,” said Nico Jones, an organizer of the protest. Advertisement "It's agonizing. You wake up. It's like, are you going to be next?” Jones, a black man, asked. "We're all tired of this system with police beating and killing us everyday,” said John Packer, another protest organizer. Advertisement The group, which started out near The Bean as a few dozen before eventually swelling to about 200, began marching around 5:30 p.m. At times going against one-way traffic, protesters marched through downtown Chicago. Their voices echoing off downtown skyscrapers, the boisterous crowd made sure anyone within earshot knew the name of Floyd. ”Say his name! George Floyd!” they roared. The protest was mostly peaceful but turned chaotic at times. About 6 p.m., as the crowd marched north on LaSalle toward Ida B. Wells Drive, several suddenly began sprinting toward the Jane Byrne Interchange. Chicago police officers created a barricade with their bicycles midway on the ramp, preventing the group from going farther. The group then formed a circle at the intersection of Ida B. Wells Drive and State Street, where they chanted and reenacted the incident that was recorded between Floyd and the police officers. "We know how the process is going to play out,” Jones said. "They exonerate these cops, and if they don't exonerate them, they give them a slap on the wrist.” Lightfoot to Trump: 'What I really want to say ... begins with F and it ends with U' » As of about 7 p.m., demonstrators were still going strong, heading south on State Street near Madison Street. At least one arrest was apparent about 7:20 p.m. when about a dozen demonstrators pushed through another bicycle barricade police had erected at State and Ohio streets, in the city's Near North neighborhood. As the crowd, which had swelled to about 200, began repeating, "Let us through,” one man of the dozen who broke through was briefly chased by officers, who took him into custody. They placed handcuffs on him and escorted him into a police truck.

By 7:45 p.m., the demonstrators and police were struck in a standoff. When some protesters sneaked past using side streets — all trying to move east toward Michigan Avenue — officers snaked around in speeding SUVs, stopping them. The game of cat-and-mouse between protesters and police continued with protesters trying to evade police barricades set up of officers on bicycles and police vehicles before the protest ended at 8 p.m. near Clark and Superior streets.
