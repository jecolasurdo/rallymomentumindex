NEW BRITAIN — A small group of protesters chanted outside New Britain police headquarters Saturday morning to protest a state prosecutor's report clearing five city officers in the fatal shooting of Zoe Dowdell. Holding "Black Lives Matter” banners and other signs, they yelled "no justice, no peace,” called police murderers and accused prosecutors of a cover-up in the shooting. Advertisement Speakers proclaimed that the community is infuriated, but this was the third gathering in a row to draw only a small crowd — and few or no New Britain residents. Black leaders from New Britain haven't been part of the rallies, and city NAACP President Ronald Davis said Saturday evening that the local community isn't part of the protests. "We're working with the police department, and we believe that if the officers are wrong, justice will be served,” said Davis, who noted that an internal police investigation is still going on even though the prosecutor's report concluded the shooting was justifiable. "We had a good police chief who kept us informed and made us part of law enforcement, and I think the new chief will do the same."

Members of Moral Monday CT, the CCSU Marxist Student Union and other groups along with community activist Cornell Lewis of Bloomfield spoke at the rally. "We are here to let New Britain know that we are not satisfied with this report, and we'll continue to let our dissatisfaction be known,” Lewis said. "We are dissatisfied with inequality. We are dissatisfied with the continuing shooting, killing and incarceration of people of color and the dispossessed here in America.” On Dec. 14, 2017, five New Britain officers fired on a car that they suspected was used in a series of violent carjackings and robberies. Zoe Dowdell, 20, was driving and Noah Young, then 18, and Caleb Tisdol, then 15, were passengers. A yearlong investigation by state troopers and a state prosecutor concluded police were justified in shooting at the car because they believed it contained fleeing felons. The report also said police reasonably feared that Dowdell was driving toward them and intending to hurt or kill them. Dowdell was killed, Young and Tisdol were wounded. Police have filed felony drug and robbery charges against Tisdol and Young, who have been jailed for months awaiting trial.

But he said the protests have been organized by people outside New Britain, and the relations between city residents and the police are strong. "We continue to pray for the life that was lost in this tragic incident, the families of those affected, and our community,” acting Police Chief Christopher Chute said Saturday in a written statement. "The New Britain Police Department does fully support every individual's right to peacefully gather and protest to express their views.” Don Stacom can be reached at dstacom@courant.com.
