Protesters are expected to gather Wednesday at Veteran Acres Park in Crystal Lake for a Black Lives Matter demonstration sparked by the death of George Floyd. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died on May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has since been fired and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in connection with Floyd's death. The Crystal Lake protest is expected to last from 4 to 6 p.m. at the park, 431 Walkup Road. Protesters are asked to wear black clothing and face coverings, and bring signs. Demonstrations throughout the county, including those in Woodstock, Huntley and McHenry, have so far remained peaceful – some garnering local police participation.
