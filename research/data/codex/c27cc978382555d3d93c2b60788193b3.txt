Saturday's protest began at noon with a calm crowd, many people wearing face masks and carrying signs protesting Floyd's death at the hands of Minneapolis police. Water bottles were handed out, and state Reps. Leslie Herod and James Coleman, both Denver Democrats, led choruses of "Black Lives Matter” and "Hands up, don't shoot” chants. Tay Anderson, a Denver school board member who served as emcee for much of Friday's daytime protest, pleaded again Saturday for people to march peacefully. Andy Cross, The Denver PostDenver School Board At-Large-Director, Tay Anderson, center, gives a speech during the third day of George Floyd protests at the State Capitol early in the afternoon on May 30, 2020. Protesters are outraged over the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who was killed by a Minnesota police officer who pinned him to the ground with his knee on his neck. However, the mood changed after Denver Mayor Michael Hancock announced at 1 p.m. that he was invoking a citywide curfew for Saturday and Sunday nights, and that Gov. Jared Polis had authorized use of the Colorado National Guard to maintain order. "(Expletive) your curfew, we want justice!” they chanted in front of the Capitol building. Conflicts also developed among protesters — mainly as some began to get more aggressive and others urged nonviolence. Around 3:45 p.m., protesters ran into a police blockade near the 1500 block of North Washington Street, where one person threw something at officers. Other protesters began yelling at that individual, and police shot tear gas. Nearby, a fight broke out between a white man and a black woman after the woman asked the man to back away from police. At about 5 p.m., the protest seemed to be quieting down until police in riot gear formed a line on Lincoln Street in front of Civic Center Station, the National Guard standing in formation nearby. SWAT vehicles from both Denver and Aurora were parked in the street. Dozens of protesters knelt in the streets with their hands up, chanting "Don't shoot” and "Why are you in riot gear? We don't see a riot here.” Police began to issue orders to the crowd, but it was difficult to clearly hear their commands. Police then fired many rounds of tear gas, some of which landed in the homeless encampment along Colfax Avenue. Several protesters threw canisters of gas back at police, as well as rocks, water bottles and fireworks. Police just majorly tear gassed and shot pepperballs at protesters in front of Civic Center Station; huge crowd ran for it, including me. Eyes, throat burning. It's a lot of gas. Protesters were not throwing anything or advancing on cops pic.twitter.com/CPYvnvXzUz — Beth Rankin (@byBethRankin) May 30, 2020 For the next two hours police continued to fire tear gas, pepper balls, flash bangs and sponge bullets at protesters in an effort to clear them from the Capitol. Every time the gas cleared, protesters returned. A group of activists linked arms and sat on the ground in front of the Capitol. One woman called out, "If you're white, hold the line,” and more white protesters joined them in an attempt to circle the Capitol. Meanwhile, a group of protesters nearby attempted to clean graffiti off of the Scottish Rite Masonic Center at Grant and 14th. Just before 7 p.m., some white protesters tried to pull off plywood protecting the Colorado Supreme Court building. Black protesters yelled at them to stop, and others tried to reattach the boards. Shortly after that, protesters and police had a standoff at Lincoln and Colfax, with police firing tear gas at crowds in response to people throwing water bottles. After running from the melee, a Denver Post reporter saw several protesters bleeding on the ground with small, circular wounds. Some drivers stuck in traffic on Colfax Avenue — less than 200 feet from SWAT vehicles — said they were simply driving through when they got stuck amid the explosions and gas. Denver City Councilman Chris Hinds watched the crowd from near the Capitol. He said he's been out observing the protests and police reactions for hours every night since Thursday because they're in his district. He said he saw both people in the crowd and members of law enforcement escalate the situation. "There were definitely some actions by law enforcement that I believe were a little overzealous,” he said. Marchers tried to keep going, but were just blocked by police. pic.twitter.com/Vm3FGdMaIW — Saja Hindi (@BySajaHindi) May 30, 2020 The 8 p.m. curfew came and went with hundreds of protesters still in the streets, even as police used a megaphone to tell people to disperse. Police continued using tear gas and projectiles to control the crowds. Law enforcement used large quantities of tear gas to clear a section of Civic Park. Johnny Morow, a 27-year-old Denverite, said he was a little bit worried about getting arrested for violating curfew but felt he needed to be in the streets to amplify protesters' message about police violence. "So far, I haven't heard anything from any governor or anybody that is really some attempt to reconcile these kinds of murders that happen in this country,” he said. "So yeah, it's worth it for me to be here.” As darkness fell, protesters increasingly began setting fires — in garbage cans and even one under the state Human Services Building at Sherman and 16th. They were quickly extinguished. Police roamed the streets hanging off of militarized SWAT vehicles.

Sirens continued to wail, however, as did the resounding boom of explosions. Police spread into Capitol Hill, including near the Cathedral Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, where three officers and a civilian were severely injured in a hit-and-run crash around 11 p.m. Several arrests were observed taking place in the same area shortly after midnight.

Minnesota's governor brought up the full National Guard on Saturday to help bring order to Minneapolis, which has been site of widespread looting and arson, including burning down a police precinct. In Denver, 34 people were arrested Thursday and Friday for engaging in looting and vandalism, setting fires and carrying weapons.
