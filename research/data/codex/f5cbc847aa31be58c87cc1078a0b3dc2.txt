"We should all be one movement because we all want the same thing. We all want equality. We all want to be respected. We all want peace. And we all want accountability."Rivera said the goal of the protesters was to bring people together to end racism.The protest at Glenstone and Battlefield has been a weekly event for about the last month and a half, Rivera said, and the number of people participating has steadily grown.Rivera said Sunday's crowd was the largest yet. The group plans to meet again at the same location this coming Sunday at noon.
