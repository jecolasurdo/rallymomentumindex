Author: Meredith Juliet Published: 8:18 PM EDT June 7, 2020 Updated: 12:55 PM EDT June 8, 2020 INDIANAPOLIS (WTHR) - Protesters were up early Sunday to deliver their message directly to Mayor Joe Hogsett. "Y'all better wake up and listen! You better wake up and listen!" a protester shouted early Sunday in a north Indianapolis neighborhood. The Black Lives Matter protest looked a little different Sunday morning. "Today we did a peaceful protest, we did a quarantine drive-through, basically where we drove through the neighborhood of Joe Hogsett and we just basically wanted him to know there's no justice, there's no sleep," said Erika Haskins with Indy10 Black Lives Matter. The #BlackLivesMatters movement is up and at 'em this Sunday morning."No Justice, No Sleep!” #13Sunrise pic.twitter.com/Rb4id67pLI— Meredith Juliet (@MeredithJuliet_) June 7, 2020 The group met at 5:30 a.m. and drove to the mayor's neighborhood near 86th and Meridian streets. They want more information about the officer-involved shooting of Dreasjon Reed. "His mom is not sleeping, his sister is not sleeping, I'm not sleeping. So if we can't sleep, why can you? Wake up. Good morning," Haskins said. Several neighbors came outside, but Hogsett did not. "We didn't expect for him to come outside, but we did expect to wake him up," Haskins said. Just last week, the Marion Superior Court appointed a special prosecutor to investigate the police shooting death of Dreasjon Reed. IMPD Chief Randal Taylor asked the court to appoint one immediately. Reed's family disputes IMPD's account of the deadly shooting, which happened while Reed was streaming live on Facebook on May 6.
