David GoodmanAug. 23, 2014They came by ferry from Manhattan, in caravans from Brooklyn and New Jersey or on foot from the gritty neighborhood in northeast Staten Island where an unarmed black man, Eric Garner, died last month after an encounter with the police.Thousands converged on an overcast Saturday at the site of the encounter, the start of a protest march linking Mr. Garner's death to lethal police actions past and present, from New York City to Ferguson, Mo., where a white officer fatally shot an unarmed black teenager on Aug. 9.Signs and slogans touched on details of the deaths as well as broad policies that protesters argued encouraged bad behavior by officers. " 'Broken Windows' Kills,” a sign read, a reference to the aggressive policing of minor offenses like selling untaxed cigarettes, the crime Mr. Garner had been accused of committing. Chants of "I can't breathe” — Mr. Garner's words as he struggled with officers — mixed with those borrowed from Ferguson: "Hands up, don't shoot.” For days, march organizers and Mayor Bill de Blasio emphasized that the demonstration on Staten Island would not devolve into the sort of violent confrontation with police officers that had plagued the protests over the death of the Ferguson teenager, Michael Brown. By late afternoon, the march had ended and the crowds were heading home. The police said all had been quiet and there had been no arrests.Indeed, for both police officials and the Rev. Al Sharpton, who led the march, the demonstration served as a kind of protest by example for how to respond forcefully but peacefully amid accusations of police misconduct."We are not here to cause riots; we are here because violence was caused,” Mr. Sharpton said at a rally after the march. But, he said, "we are not against the police.” Mr. Garner, who was 43 and more than 300 pounds, died after the encounter with the police on July 17. A video of the episode shows an officer, Daniel Pantaleo, holding onto Mr. Garner's neck as other officers piled on to restrain him. The city's medical examiner ruled that his death was caused by the chokehold and a compression of the chest. "We will not stop until somebody goes to jail,” David A. Paterson, the former governor of New York, told the crowd on Saturday. The Staten Island district attorney, Daniel M. Donovan Jr., has said he would impanel a special grand jury, set to begin next month, that could bring criminal charges against Officer Pantaleo or others. Federal authorities have said they are monitoring the case but have not begun their own investigation.VideoDemonstrators on Staten Island protested the chokehold death of an unarmed black man who was in the custody of police officers trying to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes.CreditCredit...Chang W. Lee/The New York TimesLyndell Jones, 46, an administrative assistant from the Bronx who marched on Saturday, said she had been unable to sleep for a week after watching the video of Mr. Garner's death. "My boyfriend is big like Eric Garner — I thought of him,” she said.The Police Department had planned for crowds of 15,000 or more, officials said, though organizers said they had expected between 3,000 to 5,000. The actual total on Saturday appeared to be within the organizers' estimate. The police commissioner, William J. Bratton, said the department worked closely with Mr. Sharpton and other organizers to ensure the march went smoothly. Mr. de Blasio, who did not attend the march, said on Saturday that "after any incident like this, it's very important that people express their concerns.” But he also defended the "broken windows” approach to policing, which is associated with Mr. Bratton and has come under intensifying criticism after Mr. Garner's death. "It's about addressing problems at the grass roots consistently and energetically, and we'll continue to do that,” the mayor said.During the demonstration, community affairs officers in royal-blue shirts and baseball hats offered a stark contrast to the militarized posture of police officers in the aftermath of Mr. Brown's death. Uniformed patrol officers controlled crowds at the ferry terminal and appeared interested to keep a respectful distance from the marchers along the route. "Be police, be professional, take control,” a captain told a half-dozen huddled officers on a street corner in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, as protesters boarded the buses that would take them to Staten Island. "They're looking to show the world that New York City knows how to protest,” the captain said.At a Staten Island precinct station house on Thursday night, a few hundred people held a vigil for officers killed in the line of duty, in protest of the impending march. "It's ridiculous; there's no reason for a march,” said Thomas Kosnik, 44, a retired police detective. "Police should be given the benefit of the doubt.”At the rally, the demonstrators said their protest was not against the Police Department in general. Signs handed out by Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union read: "Support N.Y.P.D. Stop Police Brutality.”Among the marchers were members of unions that threw support behind the protests, and elected officials, including the City Council speaker, Melissa Mark-Viverito. A cousin of Mr. Brown's also attended, a spokeswoman for Mr. Sharpton said. Many invoked the names of black New Yorkers killed by the police in recent years: Amadou Diallo, Sean Bell and Ramarley Graham. Mr. Diallo's mother. Kadi Diallo, was among the speakers at the rally. "We have to stop this, there is too much pain,” she said. "Too many tears.”Several of Mr. Garner's relatives marched together in matching T-shirts bearing his name and the words he spoke just before his arrest: "It stops today.”After the march, a demonstrator shook the hand of Mr. Garner's father, Ben Carr, and told him he wanted justice. "I just want to make sure it's nonviolent,” Mr. Carr said. "We don't have that much here. Ain't no sense in tearing it up.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite IndexSite Information Navigation© 2020 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpSubscriptions
