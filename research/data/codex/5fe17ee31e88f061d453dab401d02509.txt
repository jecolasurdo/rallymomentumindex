PHOTO GALLERY: Eighth day of protests In an effort to keep the peace after sundown, the city has moved up its evening curfew to 8 p.m., which will set a pattern for the weekend. There are exceptions, such as those waiting in lines for the last day of early voting before Tuesday's primary elections.

During a media briefing with reporters Friday, Varkey recognized there is a danger of spreading the virus at these gatherings, but he would not discourage people from attending the protests and exercising their right to free speech. "If we are going to be honest, we need to acknowledge racism didn't stop during the pandemic,” Varkey said. "It is important we acknowledge the very reason and constitutional right for people to assemble, especially in the threat of ongoing racism and its impact in disparate and unequal action on the part of law enforcement. What I have told people who want to apply their constitutional right to assemble is to do it safely.” COMPLETE COVERAGE: Coronavirus in Georgia Protesters take a knee Friday for eight minutes and 46 seconds in memory of George Floyd "and countless others" in a demonstration called White Coats for Black Lives at Emory University. Photo: HYOSUB SHIN / HYOSUB.SHIN@AJC.COM He recommends protesters take steps to lower the risk of exposure, such as wearing masks and either goggles or glasses, and to bring hand sanitizer. Varkey said he was also concerned about the use of tear gas and other irritants, saying they can damage the body in ways that can spread the coronavirus and increase the severity of COVID-19. For example, people in a cloud of smoke would be more likely to touch their eyes, a portal for coronavirus. He also said it's important to recognize that although COVID-19 is a major public health threat it would be "disingenuous to not recognize structural racism is a public health threat.” He said blacks are more likely to develop COVID-19, be treated in later stages of the illness and suffer more complications, including death. Even before the pandemic, Varkey said there were significant health inequities with African Americans facing increased levels of diabetes, high blood pressure, hypertension and other health woes. The demonstration was held Friday at Emory University in Decatur. Photo: HYOSUB SHIN / HYOSUB.SHIN@AJC.COM 3:30 p.m.: A group of roughly 200 people has gathered outside of Centennial Olympic Park.
