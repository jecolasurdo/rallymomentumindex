Black Lives Matter activists in Sacramento say they crashed the wedding of an officer allegedly involved in the fatal shooting of Stephon Clark, an unarmed 22-year-old black man. A group of activists found a website with the officer's wedding information and three people showed up at the venue hours before the ceremony on Sunday, according to Tanya Faison, the founder of the Sacramento's Black Lives Matter chapter. "It let him know that we're still paying attention to him, we're still paying attention, we still want charges," she said. "Hopefully he remembers that for the rest of his life." Faison said the protest was meant to hold law enforcement accountable. "They're living their lives like nothing happened," she said. "They're not seeing any types of repercussions for their actions." More: How social media has shaped Black Lives Matter, five years later A 25-second video posted on social media shows the group entering a room and confronting the officer and his apparent groomsmen. "I just wondered if you started planning your wedding before you killed Stephon Clark or after?” said a woman in the video. "And how you've been sleeping since March 18? Clark was shot eight times in his grandmother's backyard by two police officers who said they thought he was holding a gun. It turned out to be a cellphone, and his death sparked days of protests and community anger.
