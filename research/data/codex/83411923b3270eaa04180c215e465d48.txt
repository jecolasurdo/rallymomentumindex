DALLAS - Texas State Representative Lorraine Birabil (D-Dallas) led the charge at Freedman's Memorial Cemetery Wednesday afternoon in Dallas where African Americans from as far back as the Civil War are buried in unmarked graves. Participants held signs with the names of those killed from excessive police force for the Say Their Name protest "We are all here to make sure we get the structural changes that we need,” Birabil said.The newly elected state rep took over Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson's old seat, calling for Gov. Greg Abbott to hold a special session to address concerns of the black community and criminal justice reform. She plans to file the 'See Something, Say Something Bill.'"Law enforcement asks the general public, 'if you see something, you should call us and say something.'” We are simply asking law enforcement to do the same,” Birabil said. "If they see a colleague who is engaged in police brutality or misconduct, they should say something.” Birabil says some police departments may have similar rules, but she wants to make it mandatory statewide with consequences ranging from a misdemeanor to a felony for failing to report.

"And not just black people, but all people are coming together to recognize there's injustice going on and something needs to be done about it.” Trending Dallas pilot program seeing great success by pairing officers with social workers for 911 calls Spectacular 'ring of fire' solar eclipse will occur June 21, visible in some parts of the world Police release surveillance video image of Galleria Dallas gunman Dallas County reports record-breaking 413 new COVID-19 cases; Death of 12-year-old may be COVID-19 related Investigation initiated into sexual harassment allegations concerning missing Ft.
