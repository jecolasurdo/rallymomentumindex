Advertisement On Wednesday afternoon, protesters gathered in Duluth to call for the end of police brutality, and call for the prosecution of the officers involved. People of all different ages and races stood in solidarity on 21st Avenue East and London Road over the death of someone they didn't know, but a scenario they say they've seen too much. "The African American community, and the community itself, we are tired of the consistent police brutality that goes on in America today,” said Aaron of Duluth, who declined to give his last name. "It was an absolute insult to the right to human life. Whenever we see a power that's meant to protect us killing us, it's a monstrosity,” said Kathryne Ford, one of the organizers of the protest. Now they want the officers involved to be held accountable. "We are demanding justice for George Floyd. We want the officers prosecuted like murderers because what they did was murder,” said Aurora Moon, one of the organizers. Protesters at one point confronted Duluth Police as they marched up 21st Avenue East, chanting "Stay peaceful for George," and "Say His Name" referring to George Floyd. Despite the confrontation, Duluth Police say the protest was mostly peaceful, and while they weren't involved in any way in George Floyd's death, it hits home for them as they say their goal is to protect everyone. "We certainly recognize the value in every life, whether we're making an arrest or not, we treat everybody with respect and dignity," said Duluth Police Public Information Officer Ingrid Hornibrook. The protest in Duluth comes after earlier Wednesday afternoon Governor Tim Walz said he respects the rights of people to peacefully protest. "To all of those of you who are in pain, to those who are angry, to those who are afraid, I not only see you, I hear you, and I stand with you,” Walz said. "We want people to use their voices for good, and be kind, but we want people to be strong and stand up with each other for each other,” Ford said. On Wednesday afternoon, Duluth Police Chief Mike Tusken posted on his Facebook page in regards to George Floyd's death saying in part, "My heartfelt condolences go out to Mr. Floyd's family and friends for their significant and untimely loss." At one point during the protest, London Road had to be closed, but as of Wednesday evening, it is open again.
