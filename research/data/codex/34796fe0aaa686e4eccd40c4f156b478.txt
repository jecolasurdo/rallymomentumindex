Now community members march miles to see an end to itKelly Powers, Salisbury Daily Times Published 10:31 p.m. ET June 10, 2020 | Updated 10:04 a.m. ET June 11, 2020CLOSE Hundreds marched miles to the Salisbury City Police Department on Wednesday afternoon to protest police brutality and the death of George Floyd. Salisbury Daily TimesCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORESALISBURY, Md.— When Martin Luther King Jr. was shot, Marchelle Robinson was 3 years old. When she watched her Salisbury community boil up in rage after a black 22-year-old man was shot to death by police in 1968, she was about 13. By 2020, she thought her world would look a bit different. "Who would have thought, so many years later, that I would have to be in a march of my own — to witness what happened to George Floyd," Robinson said, elbow-to-elbow with her daughter and granddaughter. "And I wanted to bring my granddaughter here because... she's a part of history now."The Robinsons were three of hundreds forming a march through Salisbury, Maryland, honoring the late George Floyd, among others, as they rallied for social justice and an end to police brutality. Breasia Robinson said she's sick and tired of seeing people die and "the same thing happen, year after year."She's 14 years old. Breasia Robinson shouts, "Say his name," loudly as the massive march shouts back, "George Floyd," in a march for social justice in honor of Floyd that stretched across Salisbury Maryland, on June 10, 2020. The passionate 14-year-old said she marched because she was tired of not being able to do anything about what she saw happening in the world — so she stood up. (Photo: Kelly Powers)"Honestly, I was tired of sitting around and not being able to stand up. Stand up for my people," Breasia said, her grandmother smiling toward her, head nodding. "With this protest going on, we have something to fight for, we have something to do — and we have a cause."Wednesday evening's march, and its counterpart set for the following day, joined a list of rallies and peaceful gatherings that have already taken to city streets. A Wicomico County NAACP and AFSCME trade union protest in the form of a vehicle caravan called attention to the grave intersection of racial disparity and today's coronavirus pandemic. Small protests have coalesced in front of Walmart in North Salisbury, as well as Salisbury University, on multiple occasions. A protest brimming with over 100 people took over the courthouse steps downtown on June 4, community leaders joining residents of many backgrounds searching fervently for the beginning of a healing process. The Robinson family — (from left) Marchelle, Breasia and Latoya — gather with fellow protesters ahead of a march for social justice in honor of George Floyd, which traveled roughly three miles across Salisbury Maryland, on June 10, 2020. "I wanted to bring my granddaughter here because... she's a part of history now," Marchelle said in the minutes before marching.

Protests have erupted across the country following George Floyd's death under the knee of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin. A chilling video of what would later be charged as second-degree murder, alongside recent deaths of other black Americans like Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery, proved potent catalysts in an emboldened Black Lives Matter movement. And as rallies and marches press on weeks after Floyd's death — hundreds of footsteps joined the rallying cry from an Eastern Shore city with centuries of it's own pain.'Not a trend'Tanisha Watson speaks, filled with passion after a march for social justice in honor of George Floyd across Salisbury Maryland, on June 10, 2020. "Racism is here," she said of her small city, the massive crowd bent in a circle at her feet as she spoke through the megaphone. "Injustice is here." (Photo: Kelly Powers)Tanisha Watson is tired of people thinking her small city is shielded from hate. She said she's tired of it being only categorized as a happy, university town."Racism is here," she shouted in her megaphone, the massive crowd bent in a circle at her feet. "Injustice is here."Humid air hung on their shoulders as hundreds marched nearly three miles from Salisbury University to the Salisbury Police Department. Young voices filled a diverse crowd sprinkled with its older generations. As the sea of people walked with newly sparked anger, a viscous undercurrent of city history would move with them. Sweating arms carried homemade signs and voices shouted "BLACK LIVES MATTER" across the pavement, but deep memory already lined the streets.Salisbury remembers three abhorrent lynchings of black men.Salisbury remembers segregation and a Civil Rights movement. Salisbury remembers its riots of 1968, when a familiar pain reverberated through communities of color after Daniel Henry was shot to death by a Salisbury police officer. The list continues.

"This wasn't just a week trend," Amari Jackson said to the marchers, her mask at her chin. "We want change for these lives."Repeatedly community leaders and speakers emphasized the need to vote in November and stay active after the protest heat simmers. "The rights that we know we have? We're coming for them," said Amber Green, community activist and and founder of the Fenix Youth Project. "I know we're here about George Floyd — but you've got to think local."A Lynching Memorial Task Force was formed in January, aiming to help a city honor lives lost in history it struggles to remember. Tanisha Watson shouts, "Black lives matter," filled with passion after a march for social justice in honor of George Floyd across Salisbury Maryland, on June 10, 2020. Her call was met with the same chant from the hundreds of marchers gathered in front of the Salisbury Police Department. (Photo: Kelly Powers)Plans for a Criminal Justice Reform Task Force in Salisbury — having already received nearly 200 applicants, according to Acting Mayor Julia Glanz — and the presence of Police Chief Barbara Duncan among the protesters stood to offer optimism. But protesters demanded demonstrations yield to tangible progress. "We need a comprehensive plan," shouted Salisbury City Councilwoman April Jackson to the crowd. "We have to move on past this... otherwise we'll be on to the next murder."The hundreds of marchers swarmed the department's front parking lot, drinking water, breathing heavily and listening to passionate words from multiple speakers. Then they turned around.And they marched right back. FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInSee hundreds protest in Salisbury to honor George Floyd and push for loc...
