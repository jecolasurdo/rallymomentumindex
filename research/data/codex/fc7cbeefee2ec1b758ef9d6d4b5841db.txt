The officer was arrested Friday and charged with murder in a case that has sparked protests across the United States, including in Los Angeles, Riverside, and in Fontana Thursday night. By early afternoon, tensions increased as people moved onto streets blocking traffic. A group carrying signs moved toward the 15 Freeway in attempt to stop traffic on the roadway through the Inland Empire.
