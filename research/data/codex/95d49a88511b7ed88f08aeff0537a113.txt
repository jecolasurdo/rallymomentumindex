Inspired to do something to help kids show their support for the Black Lives Matters movement, Seneca reached out to 14-year-old Carra Fitzgerald and together they contacted friends, made posters, hung signs and ask their parents to help spread the word using social media and the local town email list.Children and adults from Wendell and surrounding towns gathered together, masked and socially distanced, with homemade signs. Seneca led the group in a march up and down the common, chanting out the words on the signs, echoed by the protesters. Calls of "Black Lives Matter,” "Kindness for Everyone,” and "Stop Killing Black People” rang loud from children and adults alike.Seneca and Carra would like to thank all their friends and community members that came to show they care about black lives and want to do their part in the fight against racism.
