Please enable Javascript to watch this video FERGUSON, MO (KTVI) – A small group of demonstrators delivered what they considered a big message, marching from the UMSL Campus to Ferguson, Saturday morning. Their little protest was an especially emotional one as thousands gathered to march in Washington, DC; led by the loved ones of Mike Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, and Trayvon Martin. By number there was no comparison between the two events. Still there seemed to be a passion in every step for the group in Ferguson which numbered less than a dozen. The tragedy of the death of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown still weighed heavily on the marchers who staged a "die-in" protest; lying on the ground four and a half-minutes signifying the four and half hours Brown's was in the street in Ferguson after he was shot and killed by police August 9th. "Just on the way down here, just like seeing one person on the side of the street support us, just putting their hands up...imagine 1,000 people like that 1,000 times of course it definitely affects you," said UMSL Student Sara Ibrahim. " I know me and her, we were holding back tears," she said referring to another young woman marching beside here. "It's just seeing the city of Ferguson on fire, seeing all these protests, it's like seeing a loved one dying, really," said UMSL student Alexander Yowell. There were non-students among the group as well. The seeds for this event were planted in the spring, long before the shooting of Mike Brown. The unrest that followed seemed unimaginable when Ferguson's mayor spoke to UMSL students hoping to draw them to Ferguson to work, live, and play. Yowell said a poster he made in support, was displayed at city hall. On this day, he had an open letter for Ferguson leaders. "You really want Ferguson to grow?" he read. "You've got to have a vibrant, diverse, and integrated community built on trust, on justice, and on peace." In spite of their small numbers they felt a closeness to those in Washington.
