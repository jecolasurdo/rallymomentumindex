Robert E. Lee in Emancipation Park."If the last 48 hours have shown us anything, it's that white supremacy is alive and well," Courtney Thomas of Black Lives Matter told protesters in Greenville.At the hour-long event, Thomas and other activists criticized President Donald Trump for not explicitly condemning white supremacy after three people died in Charlottesville."When we're facing silence from the White House, we need to be louder here," Thomas said, to cheers from the protesters.Todd May, one of the rally's organizers, said the protest was being held to send a clear message against racism."What we're trying to do here today is stand in solidarity with African Americans, with Jews, with the LGBT community, with people who are the object of white supremacy and white racism," said May, a Clemson University philosophy professor."We want to let them know that Greenville does not condone white supremacy and racism, that we oppose it, and that those who are the subject of this oppression are not alone."Shortly after the rally ended but before the crowd dispersed, several Confederate flag supporters, flying the banner on their cars and trucks, drove by the Peace Center, honking their horns and shouting.More:Charlottesville violence opens wound for South Carolina leaders, ministersActivists responded by loudly chanting "love trumps hate."The Greenville rally was one of more than 100 taking place nationwide today, according to a database assembled by The Indivisible Project, an advocacy group.'Heartbroken about this country'Several local protesters said the Charlottesville clashes are just the latest of many racial troubles plaguing the nation."I'm here because I'm heartbroken about this country," said Greenville resident Ali van den Broek. "I've always lived in a society of justice and equality and opportunity and hope in the future and I don't see any of that right now. The rhetoric has become terrible, the violence has become terrible. The divisiveness has become intolerable. I despair of my grandsons going out in public."In Charlottesville, a 32-year-old woman was killed and 19 other people were injured when a car plowed into a group of counter-protesters. Two state police officers also died when their helicopter crashed near town while they were trying to assist in Charlottesville.Greenville resident Anne Tromsness said white supremacy often is the product of a racist past that many still will not acknowledge."We've got to stop thinking that our fears and prejudices are somehow noble and a part of a valiant tradition," Tromsness said. A national problemSpeakers in Greenville emphasized that racism remains a national and local problem."I'm tired of the delusion that this is just a Charlottesville problem," said Thomas, with Black Lives Matter. "I'm tired of the delusion that this is just a problem of the 50s, the 60s, the 70s. This is a problem of right now."Greenville resident Lawson Wetli said the incidents in Charlottesville are part of a long history of racism prevalent throughout the South, and in Greenville."I am standing here in downtown Greenville, which had an official ordinance requiring racial separation in restaurants until the United States Supreme Court knocked it down in 1963," Wetli said. "My children have attended schools that were racially segregated less than 50 years ago. There is a 20-foot high Confederate memorial just down the street."It is not hard to look around and see that the problem is not just in Charlottesville — the problem is right here, in a history of white supremacy that has left a deep and painful mark."Thomas and May said it is particularly important for whites to speak out against white supremacy."I've got a message for my white sisters and brothers here: Too often we have waited for the African-American community to organize for us," May said. "Too often, we have not reached out to the African-American community and asked, "What can we do? How can we help?' Today, let us all commit to doing that: all of my white brothers and sisters reaching out to my black brothers and sisters, so that all together we can change Greenville and with all the rallies going on today, we can change this country."Sunday's rally in Greenville was announced late Saturday on Facebook. By Sunday morning, almost 200 Upstate residents had pledged to attend while another 500 had expressed interest in going to the rally.Greenville has seen frequent public protests in the wake of the November election of President Trump."I think a lot of people were alarmed and spurred into action and woken up," Tromsness said.Protests against Trump's travel ban have been held in downtown Greenville and at the Greenville-Spartanburg International Airport.The quickly assembled local gatherings have underscored the power of social media to connect activists and drive public protests.Standing at the edge of the rally Sunday, longtime local activist Mike Cubelo said, "I just hope all these people remember to vote. That's how we're going to make the real change around here."Organizers of Sunday's rally included Greenville Black Lives Matter, Upstate Peace Network, From The Ground Up, Indivisible, Upstate 100, Upstate Freedom Fighters, Piedmont Humanists, Bethatchick, Veterans for Peace and the Greenville County Democratic Party.Paul Hyde covers education and everything else under the South Carolina sun.
