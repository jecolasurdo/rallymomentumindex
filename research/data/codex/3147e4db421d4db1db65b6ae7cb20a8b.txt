Around noon, the group blockaded The Golden Bear, one of Cal's more popular spots for breakfast and lunch, tweeting that "No one eats until we get justice!" Surrounded by a 300-person crowd of sympathetic fellow students and community members, the students spoke out against the verdicts and a larger culture of systematic discrimination and violence by the police against the black community. THE GOLDEN BEAR CAFE HAS BEEN OCCUPIED BY BLACK STUDENTS! NO ONE IS GETTING IN! #FERGUSON2CAL #FERGUSON #SHUTITDOWN #ERICGARNER #MIKEBROWN — Black People (@CalBSU) December 4, 2014 The students have continued their protest throughout the afternoon, demanding demilitarization of law enforcement, a national "End Racial Profiling" act, and investigation of the criminalization of communities of color. Uplifting the National Demands!!! #BlackLivesMatter #Ferguson2Cal #ItEndsToday pic.twitter.com/CjWTEWGpBJ — BlackOUT Collective (@blackoutcollect) December 4, 2014 They've been joined by former Black Panther Party chair Elaine Brown, among other speakers. The students plan to vacate the cafe at 4:30 pm, four and a half hours after their protest began, to commemorate the number of hours Brown's body was left in the street in Ferguson after his death.
