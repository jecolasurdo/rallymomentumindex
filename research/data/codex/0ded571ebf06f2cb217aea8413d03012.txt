The 18-year-old black teen was killed Wednesday after police say he ran through the back door where cops were executing a search warrant and pointed a gun at officers as he turned. He was hit and ran around a corner before collapsing. Advertisement A search of the home yielded stolen guns and crack cocaine, and a teen with Ball-Bey escaped, they said. Police Chief Sam Dotson told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that the location of the gunshot wound does not prove or disprove the officers' narrative. Advertisement "Just because he was shot in the back doesn't mean he was running away," Dotson said. "It could be, and I'm not saying that it doesn't mean that. I just don't know yet." "What I do know is that two officers were involved and fired shots, but I don't know exactly where they were standing yet and I won't know until I get their statements." But Ball-Bey's cousin told the Daily News the autopsy confirms the family's suspicions about the police account the incident, noting the family said Ball-Bey was not armed. "It's the gut feeling we've had all along," DeAndre Cody said. "We knew Man Man was smarter than that. He just wouldn't pull a gun on the police." "Now the findings come out that he was shot in the back. And the story has changed from 'pointed a gun' at officers to 'flourished' a gun. We want answers." The two officers on scene fired four shots at Ball-Bey, and only one shot hit him in the upper right back, according to police reports and Ball-Bey's family attorney, Jermaine Wooten. A witness told police about hearing the officers' gunfire before seeing Ball-Bey drop his weapon, run through a gateway and collapse, the Post-Dispatch reported. But Wooten disputed that claim, referring to other witness accounts. Wooten told the Daily News that Ball-Bey was not even at the home where the search warrant was executed but was behind a home two doors down in a shared alleyway when police arrived. Both properties belong to the same relative. He had just gone over to a relative's house after his job at FedEx and was still wearing his uniform when he was shot, family said.

He and the other teen took off running from the men they thought were thugs, and that's when police fired, Wooten said. Wooten said the city's medical examiner told him Ball-Bey was hit in an artery, meaning he would've collapsed almost immediately, not been able to run another 30 feet. Wooten said this casts doubt on where exactly Ball-Bey was shot. The medical examiner did not respond to the Daily News' request for comment. Advertisement Ball-Bey's family said they couldn't believe the police account because Ball-Bey had kept out of trouble. He had just graduated from high school, worked part-time at FedEx, was active in the local Moorish Temple and was planning to go to college, although they couldn't say which one. "It's devastating to be honest," Cody said. "He was robbed of a future." Pictures on Ball-Bey's social media account show him posed with guns, but his dad Dennis told the Daily News the teen was an aspiring rapper and used the guns only as props in music videos to create a persona in gangsta rap. Within an hour of Ball-Bey's death, more than 100 people gathered on the streets, just days after the anniversary of the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson by ex cop Darren Wilson. As people chanted "Black Lives Matter," some demonstrators got violent, throwing rocks and smoke bombs and setting fire to a car and abandoned building. About 150 people attended a candlelight vigil for the teen Thursday night, according to local reports. Police said they are waiting for test results on fingerprints and DNA found on the gun Ball-Bey was holding, which had one round in the chamber and 13 more in the magazine, and the investigation is ongoing. The final autopsy report will be referred to city Circuit Attorney Jennifer Joyce and U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri Richard Callahan for independent reviews, police said. David Klinger, a University of Missouri-St. Louis criminologist told the Post-Dispatch that "shots in the back mean nothing" if police believed he was a threat. "If he takes off running after pointing a gun at them, then that is someone a reasonable officer could believe will be a continuing threat," he said. On Thursday, Dotson defended the shooting in the crime-riddled Fountain Park neighborhood in a press conference, where he announced a gun possession charge against a man at the raided home, Roderick Williams.

"But don't let social media and innuendo drive what you believe to be true. You have to let the facts speak." Mayor Francis Slay pledged an "independent and transparent" investigation of the shooting but stood behind police. With News Wire Services ON A MOBILE DEVICE?
