ZACH HENKE |DN Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save The University of Nebraska-Lincoln's Afrikan Peoples Union and the Executive Council of Multicultural Organizations held a Black Lives Matter rally Friday, Oct. 21, to discuss multiple issues, including alleged nationwide police brutality and protests by Nebraska football players Michael Rose-Ivey, Mohamed Barry and DaiShon Neal. The rally, which lasted from 12:30 to 2 p.m., was held on the greenspace outside the Nebraska Union.As the rally opened, the song "Glory,” by rapper Common and recording artist John Legend, was played. It was the theme song of the 2014 movie "Selma,” which is about the 1965 marches from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama.Mecca Slaughter, a graduate student at UNL, started the rally by acknowledging the Ponca, Omaha, Winnebago and Santee Sioux Native American tribes. "We would like to acknowledge these tribes who occupied this land before us, and whose descendants are our friends and colleagues today,” she said. "You went through heartache and pain, and we acknowledge your sacrifices.”Then she addressed the impetus of the rally: protests at home and across the nation drawing attention to racial inequality."We are here not in hate, but in solidarity with not just our athletes, but with everyone taking a knee around the nation.”Slaughter described the rally as a place for people who feel they don't have a seat at the table. She quoted Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman elected to the United States Congress, saying "if they don't give you a seat, bring a folding chair.”Friday's protest was also a sequel of sorts of a similar rally held last year. Kendall Dawson, president of the Afrikan Peoples Union, said her hope after that rally, and others like it across the nation, was to see a more progressive, unified U.S.. Sadly, Dawson said, that hope didn't translate to palpable change."I prayed to myself that things would be a lot better a year from then and the need would decrease for rallies like this,” Dawson said. "Little did I know, I would be in the exact same position, pleading for the injustice to end.”Jewel Rodgers, a junior management major at UNL, said there's been a long cycle of civil rights protests."So here we are again, screaming again, marching again, protesting again, asking for freedom in a society that was never really meant for us,” Rodgers said. "Here we are again, asking for the same things we've been asking for for a very, very long time.”Dawson said the need for Black Lives Matter will not cease while there are still obstacles in place hindering African-Americans on both a micro and macro level. He said from slavery to Jim Crow laws, it's impossible to ignore racial inequality — especially when it comes to police brutality today."Now, while I am alive, black men and women are brutalized and killed due to excessive force by police officers,” Dawson added. "Police brutality is a racial issue, whether you choose to believe in it or not.”Christy Hyman, a graduate student at UNL, presented "Then and Now: A Comparison,” posing the question "Are we to be one people bound together by spirit, sharing in a common endeavor, or will we become a divided community?”Hyman said people can't flee the future. To make change, she said, we have to face problems together."Let us stand for the end of racism; let us stand for the end of extrajudicial killings,” she said.After Hyman's speech, Association of Students of the University of Nebraska Sen. and Committee for Diversity and Inclusion Co-Chair Ayat Aribi spoke about compassion."Lack of empathy and compassion is the reason why there is so much hate in this world,” Aribi said. "We all come from different backgrounds and lives, and it's important that we are empathetic to those with different experiences because we have not walked in their shoes.”In particular, Aribi said there was a lack of empathy for the UNL football players who knelt in protest at the Northwestern game Sept. 24."The players were met with racist comments and demands for their expulsion,” she said. "No one stopped to think why these players knelt.”ASUN Sen. and Committee for Diversity and Inclusion Co-Chair Bryan Brunson offered a perspective on the Black Lives Matter movement through the lens of a black male."This whole movement, for me, stands for social justice, equality and love for your fellow man,” Brunson said. "In a perfect world, every American should be outraged over the recent events over the past four years.”Brunson said his feelings on this issue have built up over time. He recounted the death of Trayvon Martin in 2012, saying he mainly kept his feelings and opinions to himself. Following the deaths of Eric Garner, Terrence Crutcher and numerous others, as well as personal encounters with prejudice, Brunson could no longer remain silent, he said.To counteract this problem, Brunson proposed solutions such as education and better police training."In some of our communities, education is not the highest priority,” Brunson said. "However, my grandparents once told me that nobody can ever take away the knowledge you gain from education.”Brunson said the majority of police officers effectively do their jobs."98 percent of police have our best interest at heart,” he said.After Brunson's speech, a moment of silence was held in remembrance of black men, women and children who have died in police killings.Two hundred and six of the 865 people killed by police so far in 2016 were black, according to a project by the The Guardian called "The Counted,” .Trevor Obermueller, a member of the Committee for Diversity and Inclusion and one of the key organizers of the 2015 rally, described what it's like being a white supporter of the movement. "As a white ally, I have never experienced more pain than being a part of the BLM movement,” Obermuller said. "I have felt pain when individuals and organizations supposedly devoted to ending racism and supporting diversity have silenced the voices of black individuals and people trying to end racism.”Obermueller compared the pain he feels for people in the movement to the pain of watching someone get beat up by a bully."My true pain is not knowing my place at a BLM rally,” Obermueller said. "My true pain is catching myself in the middle of a racist thought. My true pain is seeing the cops and leaders that I want to reform have the exact same skin color as me.”Obermueller said being an ally means staying silent and constantly listening while seeking education on race and ethnicity in the U.S.Michael Combs, a political science professor at UNL, said, "This movement has the power to change the political, social, economic and cultural landscape of America.”Combs likened the movement to the Civil Rights movement of the '50s and '60s."The Civil Rights Movement had leaders across every village, hamlet and small town in America. There were leaders who stepped forward and made enormous sacrifices,” Combs said. "The BLM movement challenges this nation to put into practice the sacred principles of democracy.”Principles like justice, equality and freedom are ideals we all believe in, Combs said, but the problem lies in the implementation of these principles."We allow our students to really believe in freedom of speech, as long as their speech is in conformity with what we think at this university,” Combs said. "I dare them to step forward and move outside their framework.”Elizabeth Freeman, president of the Mexican-American Student Association, spoke about the importance of marginalized groups supporting Black Lives Matter."We all face discrimination in some form or another,” Freeman said. "As people of color and marginalized backgrounds, how can we stand to watch other people in our communities live in fear of law enforcement?”The final speaker at the rally was Tiani Reeves, a sophomore psychology major and UNL volleyball player. Reeves centered her speech around the importance of being aware as a young black woman in the U.S.Reeves said being adopted at birth and living in small-town Nebraska with her Caucasian parents and mixed-race brothers gave her a unique experience with race."I was not like anyone where I was from,” Reeves said. "No one around me existed in the same world as I did.”Reeves said she didn't notice these differences, but when she entered college, Reeves realized she was perceived differently. She was no longer just Tiani."The perception in America is that I am lesser because of the color of my skin,” Reeves said. "However, we have the power to change this.”Reeves then shifted her focus to the response to the protests at the Northwestern game."I have never felt so disappointed in my fellow Nebraskans,” Reeves said. "To hear people use racial slurs so freely, to have people suggest my peers and my friends should be hung rendered me to tears.”Reeves read a statement for those who believe that Reeves and her fellow student-athletes should be removed from their teams or campus."Slavery ended 150 years ago,” she said. "The blood, sweat and tears that are given by us to our respective athletic programs are not a commodity.”Reeves thanked those who have supported her and her fellow athletes, saying "your support has not gone unnoticed.”Slaughter ended the rally by giving the university a list of demands, the first being that UNL Regent Hal Daub issue a personal apology to Rose-Ivey, Neal and Barry. Hal was quoted in the Lincoln Journal Star as saying the players should be kicked off the team after the protest. He's since said he was misquoted and asked that the quotes be retracted. But the comments still appear in the article, as of this writing.The second demand was for a summit on civil discourse hosted by Civic Engagement and Student Affairs that would be mandatory for all student leaders on campus.The third demand was for the implementation of a mandated race relations curriculum within all departments and colleges, beyond the Achievement-Centered Education 9 requirements.The final demand issued was for the development of Husker Dialogues, which would further cultural education and training for volunteers.After the rally, Juan Franco, vice chancellor of student affairs, said he was proud of how students conducted themselves Friday afternoon."I think the rally went very well,” Franco said. "This is the best that our university has to offer when it comes to follow the rights that are given to them in the constitution,” Franco said.He said rallies like this and similar efforts are steps in the right direction."UNL is making progress when it comes to integrating diversity and inclusion,” Franco said. "We still have a long ways to go, but I think that events like this bring that issue to our consciousness even more.”news@dailynebraskan.com Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Tags Black Lives Matter Afrikan Peoples Union Council Of Multicultural Organizations Latest News Nebraska basketball lands commitment from guard Elijah Wood President Carter introduces NU budget plan, Green provides updates on UNL budget Nebraska men's basketball guard Kobe King to leave the program Trending Stories Chancellor Green announces UNL policies for July, fall semester How the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted construction on campus Madeline Reddel Quintet to perform second Jazz in June concert Curious Cornhuskers: Why UNLPD officers carry firearms Frost, Hoiberg to donate a portion of their salaries back to Nebraska athletics UNL admissions offices adapt to the coronavirus UNL Police seeking a 19-year-old man suspected of rape at UNL fraternity house Campus Conversations Ep 3: NSE and admissions with Jenni Brost and Abby Freeman Nebraskalytics: Nebraska basketball's potential replacements for Cam Mack Lincoln, Omaha communities clash with law enforcement in ongoing protests Newsletter Sign-ups Thanks for signing up for The Daily Nebraskan's e-newsletters.
