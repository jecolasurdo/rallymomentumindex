The protesters aimed to promote awareness of the death of black men at the hands of police by chanting names: Tyre King, Terence Crutcher and Keith Lamont Scott.Scott, 43, died Tuesday in the parking lot of his apartment complex in Charlotte, N.C., where his death sparked violent protest and inflamed racial tension Wednesday.With officials refusing to release any video of the shooting of Scott, two accounts emerged: Police say Scott disregarded repeated demands to drop his gun, while neighborhood residents say he was holding a book, not a weapon, as he waited for his son to get off the school bus.The Progressive Student Union provides a platform for the community to engage in conversations on state and national issues.Mark Napieralski , Progressive Student Union president, said the organization planned the anti-police brutality campaign over the summer. "It affects people who look like me,” undeclared freshman Cortiana Barnes said. "It could be my brother that is the next person that is affected by this, so that's why it's important to me, because it could affect somebody that I know, dear to me.”The current goal of the organization is to serve a petition asking the university condemn police brutality, art senior Napieralski said."We decided that it was needed to have a march on campus — to show not only the Progressive Union in a very open light, but also, we wanted to start our campaign against police brutality, with the specific intention of having UTA condemn police brutality,” Napieralski said.Psychology freshman Monica Rentowski said she heard about the protest on Twitter and participated instead of going to class because she said the protest was more important."People are dying, what could be worse than that?” Rentowski said. "I want to bring awareness but also I want to be part of the student union, so this is a start.”UTA Police were present to help facilitate the march and engage in the conversation."If we're not here, we can't communicate with them,” Jay Tillerson, UTA Police assistant chief said.Napieralski said the organization is looking to continue to confront and fight against police brutality. A public speak-out event next month will allow attendees to share stories of personal experiences.The Associated Press contributed to this report.@ssorayahnews-editor.shorthorn@uta.edu Correction The headline of this story was updated to correctly reflect the nature of the protest.

The unrealistic demand for details to be shared to the public immediately can ruin a true and thorough investigation on all parties. It has been made obvious that a percentage of a group simply want retaliation in some form or another even if they don't have any familiarity with the individual who was fatally injured. They just want to start up criminal activity and destroy the community. Hell even I have distant family members that I know cause trouble and if they got themselves fatally injured; well that would not surprise me. I find it a bit unnerving that certain individuals are claiming the innocents of someone they don't even know. Just because a man or woman ends up fatally shot by an officer; I don't jump to the streets in protest! Why? maybe because I don't know the individual, so I cannot say he or she was innocent. I cannot say the individual did not provoke the situation. Because I was not there to witness the whole event!!! If the police where notified to pay you a visit then someone thought there was a need to. If you are innocent of wrong doing, then comply, don't die, stay alive and lawyer up afterwards to plead your innocence. I just happen to be what labels are given to us a "white" person. Here is what I view as a big issue with our society. None of my white friends go around calling each other racist/derogatory/bigot names. None of my non-white friends refer or speak to or address each other with disrespecting racial terminology. Have and show respect for yourself, your friends, family etc and maybe just maybe others will not have an initial observational judgement on your character. In addition, if you are part of a peaceful protest and see individuals in your protest starting trouble; report it and turn them in. Otherwise, you are equally guilty of bad decisions of a good cop protecting a bad cop's wrongful actions. Don't be mad of one group protecting their bad apples if you are also doing it.

Must be them Whiteys fault keeping minorities down (Asians and Jews have lower rates of crime and higher average income than whites despite being minorities).In all seriousness it's time that academic institutions accept the scientific fact that race exists. Blacks on average have low IQ's (85 avg.) and higher testosterone level which makes them more prone to aggression and violence, consequently Asians and Jews have on average high IQ's (106 & 112 respectively) and lower testosterone which makes them less prone to aggression and violence and also more successful. Fun fact, every Olympic Sprinter finalist has had West African ancestry since 1934.Race exists. There are average genetic differences between races. When one race is causing a massively disproportionate amount of the violent crime they are also going to be disproportionately shot by police.If blacks don't want to be shot by police, then maybe they should stop shooting, murdering, raping, robbing, assaulting, burgling, & thieving so much more than anyone else. Report Add Reply JoelU Sep 23, 2016 4:54pm Spot on. Report Add Reply MLen Oct 13, 2016 10:40am You seem to be ignoring how income and racist macro and micro-aggressions affect crime rates--in particular, how they affect American society. Due to the fact this country was built on the inequality of people (i.e. killing the Natives and proclaiming te country "discovered", among other things), there were systems put in place to make sure that people who were marginalized would not obtain the same power they currently had; perhaps this was out of fear of having the same group they marginalized come back and treat them like they had been treated, or maybe they genuinely didn't believe that they were human. Still, the effect was that systems were put in place to make sure that this power could not be obtained--for Black people specifically, think 3/5ths, Jim Crow, and The Grandfather Clause, to name a few. Even after those laws were shot down, the mentality that one group of people was over the other still reigned--and still reigns. Think lower pay rates for certain jobs, lowered employment opportunities based on things as simple as a name, the fact that real estate agents are told not to show certain houses in certain markets to certain people regardless of their income...the list goes on.You'll notice that, at large, the aggressions affect the marginalized group's income, which then brings about a level of classism--the idea that those who are poor either deserve to be or put themselves in that position, and those with more money have more worth. There's a whole can of beans with classism that would be too deep to get into, considering all the nuances behind the behaviors shown to those who cannot get money in the same way that others do. Add onto it, then, the struggle that those in the lower class must go through to keep afloat, attempting to not drown in debt and starve from a lack of food and resources.All of this causes stress, and stress can greatly affect one's decisions. So, many of those people, trying to survive, turn to crime to alleviate their lack of money or lack of resources. It is not an action that I'm condoning, but the reasoning is still there.A majority of the crimes committed by white people are in the lower class, and often times, they live in the same conditions as their black counterparts. The trend still exists, meaning that crime had less to do with race and more to do with income.Let's then tack on more of the disadvantages of being a member of a marginalized race in this country--being targeted for the school-to-prison pipeline which was crafted to gain money from more inmates, the housing issue I mentioned before which often creates poverty hotspots for your group, the media presenting the group's culture either as a fad that can be taken by anyone or as a violence-inducing lynchpin, Euro-centric ideas of beauty that condemn their looks while trying to take some of them for themselves... Again, that's only a few, and all of these tack on more stress, which makes them look to their lack of resources and opportunities, which often leads them to crime either to gain more resources or use a faulty method to relieve stress--because the laws and mindset of America seems to stand against them.The crimes they commit, at large, are often centered around things that they faultily believe will increase income; Referencing your graph, there are three types of crime that Black Americans commit more than White Americans--murder, robbery, and gambling.Since we've already shown how classism affects anyone, it's perhaps fair to say that having racist ideas tacked onto it will further the behavior. In truth, when it comes to the reaction to being looked down on, condemned, and told that you are a lesser being, between Black and White Americans, it isn't so different.Now, I'm not justifying the crime rates. Crime is not good, obviously. I'm letting you know you're missing a large part of the picture--that it's not quite as black and white as you seem to think.Maybe you already saw the trend and willfully ignored it to look only at race and crime at face value for your own sake. Or, perhaps, you genuinely hadn't thought about it.If you would like to read more facts please read this: http://racisminamerica.org/truth-fbi-crime-statistics-race/While the source is opinionated, the information the source references is not. The argument is also more put-together than my own. It's just that this source and I came to a similar conclusion.Either way, please consider the thought the next time you look up "black crime rates". There's more to it than you appear to think.

Report Add Reply Hades Sep 22, 2016 1:20pm Black Lives Matter is not really about "Black lives mattering”, it is about police brutality. If BLM actually cared about black lives they would be drawing attention to the extremely high rate of black on black violence and ending the "snitches get stitches” mentality in the inner cities which result in thousands of black deaths every year at levels much disproportionately higher than any other 'race on race' crime. While not all BLM members are racist, there are many members that are, such as yesterday the BLM rioters who stripped, beat, and dragged a random white person through a parking garage. This whole 'Well Black people can't be racist!' mentality is toxic and irrational, and turning the other cheek to it only creates more racism and hate from all sides, which only results in more negative outcomes and further divisiveness. Also this post isn't to disregard police brutality, we should hold the bad apples in the police force accountable for their actions, regardless of the race of the victims. We need to get rid of this 'Us vs. Them' mentality that has grown very prominent in today's society that is dividing us all, and instead come together and cooperate for solutions. BLM is not the answer to that. Report Add Reply kevenka Sep 22, 2016 1:20pm Funny how people complain about police brutality against black people when it's been proven that police are less inclined to black man vs any other ethnicity. Black's commit more blue collar crime yet are shot LESS. However, they do receive more media attention. Media playing you BLM people like sheeps... Report Add Reply Mavhistorychick Sep 22, 2016 11:53am First, please learn your history before comparing a modern movement to the KKK. In short, the KKK espoused a form of racial cleansing by promoting the idea that Anglos were the master race. THAT, my fellow Mavs, is a far cry from BLM which seeks to bring awareness to the disproportionate number of minorities, specifically African Americans, subjected to deadly force by those we entrust to protect and serve our communities. Dialogue and awareness are fantastic but it helps if the discussions are based in fact and not rhetoric. Institutional racism is, sadly, still a major problem in this country. Until that is honestly addressed, minority groups will continue to be disaffected with a system that inherently treats them differently. During the Jim Crow era, black Americans had to fear violence and lynchings. Well, today those ropes have been replaced by guns. Stop trying to bring in black on black crime that occurs with civilians, that is murder and usually the offender is tried in a court of law versus some police officers taking the role of judge, jury, and executioner. Report Add Reply Hades Sep 22, 2016 1:34pm Some could argue that the "disproportionate number of minorities, specifically African Americans, subjected to deadly force by those we entrust to protect and serve our communities" you are referring to comes from the fact that blacks commit a much disproportionately higher amount crime against fellow blacks, which results in a disproportionately higher amount of police confrontations with said blacks, which unfortunately creates a statistically higher probability for a negative outcome to occur for said blacks. Not justifying the police by any means, especially in situations where they obviously use excessive force when it's not needed (on victims of any race for the matter), and they should be held accountable for those actions instead of protected by colleagues. Report Add Reply Mavhistorychick Sep 22, 2016 6:27pm That type of ill informed information only perpetuates the issue. BLM is NOT anti police. Do not lump the radical individuals that do espouse that ideology with what the movement actually stands for. Regarding your assertion of who commits the most crime, do your research. As long as individuals such as you vehemently defend the idea that the use of deadly force is an acceptable first response then you are also part of the problem. Please continue living in your lily white fantasy bubble. Also, try researching issues to understand the entire scope before commenting. It's easy to hide behind a computer screen and be a critic without the facts. Walk a mile in another man's shoes before you leap to judgement. http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/8078586 Report Add Reply JoelU Sep 22, 2016 11:33pm I wouldn't be accusing anyone of being ill informed if I were using opinion blog links. Facts are facts regarding crime stats. Doesn't mean you have to like them. Shirking responsibility for one's actions is the number one problem among these neanderthals and continuing to pass blame for your predicament in life will get you nowhere. Want respect? Earn it like the rest of the world does. The victim card is played out. Report nomsum Sep 22, 2016 10:50am Yes, one of the 2 shootings involved a black cop. BLM is about POLICE brutality, but there are obviously a lot of racial things tied up in the brutality. Just because a black cop shot him doesn't make him any less dead, doesn't make it any less wrong. How is BLM a new hate group? This isn't a rhetorical question. I'd really like to know your thoughts. Are you a liberal, and also anti-black or are you not a liberal, and theorizing that they are anti-black? I don't even know how to respond to the "genocide" thing in a short enough comment. And the KKK thing made me laugh. It's sad to think there are people around me that think like this and I'm even sadder someone gave you a thumbs up. If you was to discuss- IRL, we can broaden each other's horizons. Either of you Report Add Reply Robertmartin03 Sep 22, 2016 8:41am Wait a minute, the cop who shot the armed man, was black.... Why are the BLM rioters talking about racial injustice? BLM is the new KKK. BLM is the most prominent racial hate group on campus now. Does UTA allow for other racial hate groups on campus? Why does the BLM have anything to do with the "progressive student union"? They're anti black... Progressives have always been anti black. They use abortion to genocide black children... BLM is only stirring up racial hatred and division, they are the KKK. Report Add Reply Thebes Sep 22, 2016 10:52am Completely agree, and it's not about black lives. Black men are shot up regularly in inner city neighborhoods, and I hear nothing about that. They also ignore the fact that whites tend to be shot more than blacks if you adjust for crimes committed. If I were a threatened officer, I'd rather neutralize a white criminal so that I wouldn't further harm communities with the protest to ensue.Also, if you speak up about white's issues such as affirmative action or low birth rates/declining population, people would call you a Nazi. I'd say that's a more important issue, as peaceful law-abiding whites are generally taxed at higher rates than minorities, where that money gets spent on subsidizing many non-white/immigrant families instead of being used to raise white children. This is the honest conversation about race they ask for, but they don't really want that, do they?
