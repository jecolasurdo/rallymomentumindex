LOUIS • A small group of protesters briefly gathered outside the home of Mayor Lyda Krewson on Tuesday night.The mayor arrived home during the protest and chatted with some of those in the crowd of about 25, went inside and then came back out and sat on the steps of her Central West End home. The protest went on as trick-or-treaters roamed the neighborhood.The protesters marched to the home from Kingshighway and chanted but were otherwise peaceful. Several police officers were standing guard outside the mayor's home.The protest was at least the third at the home. It was the latest of many that have followed the not guilty plea in the murder trial of former city police officer Jason Stockley. The verdict was issued Sept. 15. Stockley had been charged in the fatal shooting of drug suspect Anthony Lamar Smith in 2011.
