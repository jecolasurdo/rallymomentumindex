Families unpacked picnic lunches on parking lots before police forbade stationary gatherings. They watched as vehicles cruised past in an endless loop between Ferguson Avenue and Nesbit Drive, horns blaring and children hanging out windows.Impromptu prayer meetings pop up all over. Gospel music bands have set up on flatbed trucks. An area drummer assembled his kit at QuikTrip and kept a steady beat going for hours.Coloring stations have been set up for children. One afternoon, a man dressed as a cowboy rode through the protest zone on a horse while a Thomas the Tank Engine train gave free rides to anyone who could squeeze on.Celebrities created little stirs as they popped up in front of area landmarks such as Red's BBQ, the Northland Chop Suey and Sam's Meat Market. Nelly, Dick Gregory, Billy Bragg, Jack Dorsey, Jesse Jackson, Anderson Cooper, Aeneas Williams, Brian Williams, Keke Palmer, J Cole and Tibetan monks have stopped by. The security chief, Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, has felt comfortable enough to roam freely through the crowds, sometimes stopping to embrace protesters. The McDonald's at Ferguson and West Florissant avenues has become the de facto headquarters for journalists from around the world. They maneuver for choice spots near electrical outlets to charge phones and trade war stories about the latest tear gas barrage. A few have placed casual bets on what time the portable toilet near Canfield Drive and West Florissant will get dumped over that night.It's a diverse crowd on multiple levels — religious, racial and economic.Catholic priests in Roman collars have marched beside their female Episcopal counterparts in colorful stoles. Dreadlocked hippy white kids and young black men share joints. White guys in starched collars work on their soul handshakes. And suburban college students add their voices to the din of protest chants. But the signs of the nightly turmoil to come are all around. The placards memorializing Michael Brown are everywhere. So are posters calling for the arrest and conviction of the Ferguson police officer, Darren Wilson, who shot Brown in a street confrontation 12 days ago, though it feels much longer ago than that.Even at the most optimistic moments, such as the Aug. 14 "partest” marking Johnson's decision to pull police back and trust crowds to behave, animosity bubbled up in random chants that cursed the police. As darkness has descended, most of the older adults and children have cleared out. In the first week of protests, so did the majority of religious leaders and politicians. As the hour gets later, the crowds get younger and more aggressive.Then begins the familiar Ferguson ebb and flow of confrontations, bullhorn police warnings, street blockades, crowd dispersal and regrouping. They reach critical mass and erupt into scenes of tear gas clouds, pepper spray, masked men, pistol shots, breaking glass and stampeding crowds. And a young man who had waved to a familiar reporter from the Thomas the Tank Engine ride sprints from Ferguson Market and Liquor with a looted six pack in his hand. 0 comments Tags Riot Looting Protest Michael Brown Darren Wilson St. Louis Paul Hampel Be the first to know Get local news delivered to your inbox!
