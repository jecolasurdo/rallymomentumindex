Edwin Raymond, who said he was heading to work after the rally, spoke of the need for racial healing in the country."Until racism in America is no longer taboo, we own up to it, we admit it, we understand it and then we do what we have to do to solve it. Unfortunately we're going to have these issues," he said.Members of #nyc law enforcement joined @JumaaneWilliams in #Brooklyn today to send this message about @Kaepernick7.
