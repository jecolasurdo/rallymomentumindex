(Staff Zen Vuong) By Brian Day | bday@scng.com and Zen Vuong | Zen.Vuong@sgvn.com | San Gabriel Valley TribunePUBLISHED: September 4, 2015 at 3:15 p.m. | UPDATED: August 28, 2017 at 3:18 a.m.PASADENA >> A group of Black Lives Matters activists Friday protested the arrest of one of the group's local leaders in Pasadena and accused police of trying to stifle the organization's voice. At a demonstration in front of the Pasadena Police Department Jail, Nana Gyamfi, the attorney representing Black Lives Matter activist Jasmine Richards, said her client should be released from custody because she didn't do anything wrong. Group members further accused the Pasadena Police Department of harassing the group and subverting members' free speech rights. "They are arresting and prosecuting people for their political beliefs and for their exercise of their free speech rights,” Gyamfi said. "When this happens in any other country, this country calls it terror. Yet the Pasadena Police Department and its prosecutors are doing that — terrorizing the community with intimidation, with violence, with false arrests, with false imprisonments and retaliatory prosecutions that are being used to kill free speech and criminalize civilians who are struggling for the right to be human right here in Pasadena.” • VIDEO: Black Lives Matter rally in Pasadena Meanwhile on Friday, prosecutors filed a felony charge of lynching, defined as taking a person from lawful police custody by means of a riot, against Richards, Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office spokesman Ricardo Santiago said. She entered a not guilty plea and was ordered back to Pasadena Superior Court on Sept. 23 for a preliminary hearing setting. Richards was also initially arrested Wednesday on suspicion of child endangerment, inciting a riot and resisting or obstructing police duties, but no charges were filed against her in connection with those allegations. Richards' bail, which was initially set at $125,000, was reduced to $75,000 at Friday's hearing. Pasadena police officials maintain the department is not singling out the group unfairly and that arrests were based on criminal acts. "The Pasadena Police Department supports the Constitutional rights to assembly and free speech, but the actions of Jasmine Richards and others went beyond the law when they interfered with the lawful duties of police officers, interfered with a lawful arrest and blockaded police vehicles in the roadway,” Pasadena Police Chief Phillip Sanchez said in a written statement. "Pasadena police officers professionally and proactively arrested persons engaged in illegal activity which jeopardized the safety of the public and police personnel.” Police arrested Richards Wednesday, four days after they allege she grabbed a woman from police custody during a confrontation between Black Lives Matter protestors and officers at La Pintoresca Park on Aug. 29. The woman being arrested was suspected of assaulting staff at a nearby restaurant. Police ultimately took the battery suspect to jail, Pasadena police Lt. Tracey Ibarra said. They made no additional arrests that day, for fear of escalating the incident further, but began rounding up a series of four adult suspects, including Richards, and four juvenile suspects between Sunday and Thursday, she said. The other seven people arrested in connection with the Aug. 29 incident at La Pintoresca Park were all cited on suspicion of resisting or obstructing police duties. Pasadena police previously arrested Richards in late March on suspicion of a series of misdemeanors allegedly stemming from another Black Lives Matter demonstration. That case is pending. Gyamfi called for all charges against Richards to be dropped. Black Lives Matter Pasadena member Michael Williams agreed. "Jasmine has been arrested twice. Both occasions were many days after the demonstration, proving that this is not anything about law and order or about justice. This is about a vendetta that the police have against Black Lives Matter Pasadena and those who are involved with Black Lives Matter Pasadena,” Williams said. "You can't even meet in a public park anymore because of the constant harassment and the misuse of power that the Pasadena police have been showing,” he said. Black Lives Matter chapters across the nation say police are spying and targeting them as they work to highlight the Black community's experience with law enforcement violence and intimidation tactics. "We're not just talking about Black Lives Matter Pasadena chapter today,” Black Lives Matter Long Beach organizer Dawn Modkins said. "We're talking about Long Beach. We're talking about New York. We're talking about L.A.. We're talking about Chicago. We're talking about Baltimore. We're talking about Ferguson. An attack on one is an attack on our entire organization and an attack on the Black community. So know that we are organized. Know that Jasmine is not alone. Know that anyone else who has been harassed here in Pasadena — adults and children alike — are not alone.” Newsroom Guidelines News Tips Contact Us Report an Error Get the latest news delivered daily!
