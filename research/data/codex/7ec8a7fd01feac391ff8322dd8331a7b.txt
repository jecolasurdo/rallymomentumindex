Shoppers milled about. Baked goods, crafts and fresh produce changed hands. A live band provided background music.But shortly after 10 a.m., a group of people protesting the fatal police shooting of Michael Brown arrived. They carried signs, chanted and kept marching until noon, when the market ended at its regular closing time.Vendors said it was the first time protesters had targeted the popular market, which is held weekly at the Victorian Plaza in the shadow of the old train trestle that serves as a reminder of Ferguson's beginning as a railroad stop. Unlike the West Florissant Avenue commercial strip about two miles east, the city's historic district has been spared the worst of the unrest that has rocked the community for over a month now. Most protests along South Florissant Road have focused on the headquarters of the Ferguson Police Department, at 222 South Florissant. At the farmers market, vendors said they've actually seen better business over the last month. "The week right after the shooting was the busiest week we ever had,” said Lou Hannibal, who has been selling tomatoes, zucchini, cucumbers and other produce at the market since it started 11 years ago. "Everyone showed up to support the community.” Even the Rev. Jesse Jackson, in town on Aug. 16 to help lead a protest at the Canfield Green apartments, quietly showed up at the market that rainy morning to mingle with the crowd. Some protesters say Saturday's demonstration is part of a new strategy to become more active on South Florissant, in front of many of the community's most popular businesses and community gathering spots. They'll be back next Saturday, they say."That way it'll get their attention and they'll call City Hall,” said Marvin Skull, one of the protesters.The small group of protesters grew to about 30 over the course of the morning as police watched. Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson, who showed up and talked to the protesters, described it as "peaceful.” Charles Mayo, one of the organizers, said the morning "went beautifully.” The group "established a dialogue” with police and the officers helped add to the impact of the demonstration. "That's the goal,” he said. "To make people uncomfortable. To make people aware what's going on in the community.”After the market closed, the small group moved down South Florissant to other businesses. Mayo said he and others plan to demonstrate in the busy area of Ferguson every Saturday in order to get what he described as "this side” of the community to put pressure on local leaders. He and others in the group are calling for a boycott of South Florissant businesses to get owners to put pressure on local officials to act.The protesters say they want Darren Wilson, the police officer who shot Brown, arrested. They also want Jackson, the police chief, and Ferguson Mayor James Knowles to step down. Cathy Lenae Jenkins, a manager at Cathy's Kitchen Restaurant & Diner and the daughter of the owner, said she's heard "murmurings” of a boycott. "What happened is a terrible situation, but at the same time, small businesses in Ferguson all support each other,” she said.Ferguson resident Anna Ravindranath has heard the talk about protesting along South Florissant and targeting business owners."This isn't just the part of town for white business owners,” she said.If the community is to enact change — including reducing its dependence on revenue from traffic fines and court fees — then the residents should do everything they can to support all local businesses, she said. "We need these businesses here so we can have a stable community,” Ravindranath said. "You need to have that stable community in order to enact some of these systematic changes.”Whether the South Florissant protests will get larger or continue, or even deter business, is an open question. The protesters don't appear unified on the new strategy. Sputnik Thompson, who was protesting in the Andy Wurm Tire and Wheel parking lot on South Florissant across the street from the police station, said she bought a tire earlier in the day. "I don't have a problem with the businesses, I want them to strive and do good,” she said. She gestured across the street toward the police station: "The problem is right there.” 0 comments Tags Ferguson Ferguson Brewing Company Michael Brown Charles Mayo Darren Wilson Ferguson Police Mike Lonero Protest Protester Thomas Jackson Commerce Economics A message from David Nicklaus Want to stay smart about what's happening in St. Louis?
