(Robin Epley — Advocate-News) By Robin Epley | repley@advocate-news.com | Fort Bragg Advocate-News and the Mendocino BeaconJune 10, 2020 at 10:07 a.m.FORT BRAGG — A second Black Lives Matter protest was held noon, Thursday, June 4 in downtown Fort Bragg, this time organized by local activist, Sierra Wooten. The protest, though not as well-attended as the first, was perhaps more poignant, as protestors took a knee for 8 minutes and 46 seconds outside Fort Bragg Town Hall on N. Main Street — the same amount of time a Minneapolis police officer held his knee to the neck of George Floyd, resulting in Floyd's death. "We are coming together to mourn the loss of George Floyd,” Wooten said. "We are also honoring victims that have been killed by police force.

(Robin Epley — Advocate-News) Nearly the entire block, from Redwood Street to Laurel Street, was covered in the chalk outlines of bodies, each bearing the name of more than 100 Black men and women killed by police brutality in America in the last decade. "These people can't be in their homes, they can't be at school, they can't be running; we've got to wake up,” Wooten said. Elijio and Lisa Arreguin, along with Maureen Smyth, all of Fort Bragg, were helping to draw the outlines, using their own bodies as templates on the ground. "We're here because we're frustrated,” Elijio Arreguin said. "The recent events (in Minneapolis) were clearly a catalyst for a spike of awareness.” U'i Wesley, of Fort Bragg, gave several impassioned speeches to the gathered crowd, asking them to look at every name inscribed on the sidewalk. "Be their sister, be their bother, be their mother, be their child,” Wesley said through tears. "You have to feel their pain to change.” Wesley said there was "power” in every single name. "We have to be honest, and honesty is hard,” she said. "If you love them and respect them, you will do the work. You're going to be the domino effect of positive change. Do the work!” Wesley, who is native Hawai'ian, was creating ti leaf leis during much of the protest, and hung one around the portrait of George Floyd at the beginning, and later honored Wooten with one around her neck as well.

(Robin Epley — Advocate-News) Wooten said she had had an extremely difficult time getting a permit for the protest until she went directly to Fort Bragg interim police chief, John Naulty's office. Naulty also spoke to the assembled crowd, and said that the community needed to be educated by people like Wooten and Wesley, who were willing to speak up and organize events like the protest. "We sit in Fort Bragg, and it's kind of a little bubble here,” Naulty said. "Thank you for educating us. Thank you for educating me. Thank you for educating this city.” Also in attendance were Fort Bragg Mayor Will Lee, City Manager Tabatha Miller, several members of the police station and the city's offices, and City Councilor Jessica Morsell-Haye. "You are not responsible for your ancestor's wrongdoing, but you may have benefitted from them,” Wooten said. "White privilege is a White person's problem, we cannot solve it for you. Learn your history.” Wooten and Wesley said they hope to continue with the protests in the future.
