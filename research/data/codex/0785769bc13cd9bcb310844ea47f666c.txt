Our Streets!” as about 300 protesters marched in downtown Denver on Tuesday evening, joining in national demonstrations in the wake of a Ferguson, Mo., grand jury's decision not to indict police Officer Darren Wilson in the death of Michael Brown. When demonstrators gathered across the street from the Capitol about 6 p.m., organizers admitted they didn't exactly know what was going to happen. As it turned out, the night served to highlight a variety of grievances. Besides the Brown protest, there were banners decrying the July shooting death of Ryan Ronquillo. And after an hour of marching, the protesters ended up at the front doors of the Denver jail, where they repeatedly shouted, "Marvin Booker, Marvin Booker,” recalling the inmate who died at the facility in 2010. Organizers said members of the Ronquillo family would be flying to Ferguson to meet with protesters there. Denver's district attorney determined in August that no criminal charges would be filed against four police officers who shot and killed Ronquillo, 20, in a funeral home parking lot July 2. After brief speeches near the Capitol, the protesters, some of whom carried lit candles, walked into the middle of Broadway. From there, the group cut a wide swath, at times touching 17th Street, California Street, the 16th Street Mall, Stout Street then the Colorado Convention Center before eventually reaching the Denver Detention Center. All along the walk, Denver police tried their best to hold back traffic from the marchers. One officer, who didn't want to be identified, said the department "knew there would be some kind of presence (on the streets) tonight. ... We just want to make sure that everyone is safe.” Although there were no obvious signs of discord, things did get a bit tense when three armed sheriff's deputies, perhaps disquieted by the size of the gathering, stood on alert just inside the front doors of the jail. Organizers had planned for the march to conclude at the jail, but a large group continued the protest, moving moved west on West Colfax Avenue and blocking the viaduct over Interstate 25, Police formed a line to prevent protesters from moving onto the interstate about 8:10 p.m. Most of the crowd then dispersed peacefully. But, police said, four people who refused to leave and grabbed at officers were arrested as police used handheld pepper-spray dispensers. Two adult males were arrested for obstruction of a roadway and interference and two adult males were arrested for obstruction of a roadway, police said. No gas was deployed, police said, but a smoke canister was fired to test the wind. After walking back from I-25, one small group of protesters briefly lay on their backs in the middle of the intersection of Colfax and Broadway a little before 10 p.m. and then dispersed. One of the observers at Civic Center was the Rev. Leon Kelly, the local anti-gang crusader. He said that although he's saddened by the events in Missouri, his focus would remain closer to home. "People are upset now, but what about next week, next month?” Kelly said. "I'm worried about my city, my town; people are still reeling from last weekend (the shooting death of local rapper Kevie Durham) and tensions are high. ... That's not in Ferguson; that's right here in Denver.” Policies Report an Error Contact Us Submit a News Tip Anthony Cotton | Former Reporter Anthony Cotton is a former reporter for The Denver Post. acotton@denverpost.com More in News Jeffco elementary schools will offer in-person classes in August, district says June 19, 2020 at 11:27 a.m. Jeffco Public Schools on Thursday announced that elementary schools will offer 100% in-person classes in August.
