Spokesman Dirk Tedmon issued a statement that said, "We respect our students' right to freedom of speech as long as their actions do not threaten the safety and security of others.” The girls volleyball team at South follows several football players at Minneapolis North taking a knee for the national anthem last Friday night. "It's a peaceful protest, they were actually, not harming anyone. They decided to do that on their own, so we value that and want to make sure they have the opportunity to do that within our school system,” Michael Walker, head the the Office of Black Male Student Achievement in the Minneapolis Public Schools, told TEGNA partner KARE. "Obviously we're not promoting one way or the other but we want to make sure they have the opportunity to share their perspective, and speak their truth, stand up for what they believe in and allow that to happen. As long as it's not infringing on anyone else's rights we're okay with that,” Walker added. Kings at North taking a knee for the anthem, exercising freedom of speech.
