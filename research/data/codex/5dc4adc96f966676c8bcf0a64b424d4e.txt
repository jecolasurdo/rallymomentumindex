The first, according to organizers that contacted Haines City officials for permission, will take place at 2 p.m. in front of Haines City Police Department. The second starts at 5:30 p.m. at Railroad Park. City officials will speak at the first protest, including Vice Mayor Anne Huffman and numerous community leaders. Last week at the City Commission meeting, a moment of silence was observed in memory of George Floyd, the man killed by Minneapolis police in late May, sparking international protests. Several members of the the Haines City Police Department knelt during the moment of silence. Haines City Police Chief Jim Elensky was the first chief in Polk County to speak out against Floyd's death. Meanwhile, members of the Polk County Democrats Florida posted on the organization's Facebook page that they will be present with a voter registration booth at the 5:30 p.m. protest at Railroad Park. "Turn protest into policy by voting to elect representatives who share your values,” the post said. Public parking is available downtown for the 5:30 p.m. protest. "I encourage peaceful protest, and that is what I expect on Friday based on the organizers' request to their participants,” Elensky.
