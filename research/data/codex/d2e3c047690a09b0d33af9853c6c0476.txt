More CBS Entertainment CBSN ChicagoWatch Now Demonstrators Stage "Die In” Outside Michigan Ave. Shops In Protest Of Laquan McDonald Shooting December 5, 2015 at 3:35 pmFiled Under:Bob Roberts, Laquan McDonald, Magnificent Mile, The Shops at North BridgeProtesters staging a "die-in" outside The Shops at North Bridge.(Credit: Bob Roberts) (CBS) — The protests continue more than a week after the release of the video showing the police-involved shooting of 17-year-old Laquan McDonald. WBBM's Bob Roberts reports that one protest targeted North Michigan Avenue Saturday afternoon. 13 people laid on their backs and another dozen stood chanting to express their anger and frustration. Shawn Lampkin says the problem is age-old and must be addressed. WBBM 780's Bob Roberts "There's no epidemic rate of black cops going around randomly shooting white people which suggests that there is something special about the black community,” Lampkin said. "Why don't we take the time out to address it? So we're saying as a taxpayer, take a little time out of your day to consider the issue. Just to consider the issue and then make a decision on who you vote for.” Shoppers continued to file by and enter and leave The Shops at North Bridge. Some paused briefly and joined the chant before moving on.
