(Wes Parnell/NEW YORK DAILY NEWS) The mother of a mentally ill man shot dead in his home says the NYPD should no longer act as first responders to 911 calls like the one she made trying to get him help seven years ago. Mohamed Bah's mother and about 50 others gathered outside his Harlem apartment Wednesday on the seventh anniversary of his death, and called for the NYPD to stop acting as first responders to the mentally ill. Advertisement "I will never forget that day," said Hawa Bah. "I am heart broken.” She called 911 because she thought paramedics would get her 28-year-old son to a hospital. Cops responded instead and shot him to death, alleging that Bah lunged at them with a knife. The Bah family's lawyers alleged that cops intentionally moved that knife into a flood-prone NYPD warehouse just days before Hurricane Sandy. It and other items were lost in the storm.
