The annual March for the Dream, organized by the community organization MLK365, began at Sacramento City College and traveled for more than four miles through the city. Reclaim MLK, a march put on by Black Lives Matter Sacramento, started at Alhambra Boulevard and J street, proceeding down J toward downtown. The groups met at the Convention Center, where BLM marchers chanted next to a truck bed where organizers of the March for the Dream were demonstrating. Members of BLM were eventually invited onto the truck and led chants along with the March for the Dream's executive director. The Reclaim MLK march then continued to the Capitol.
