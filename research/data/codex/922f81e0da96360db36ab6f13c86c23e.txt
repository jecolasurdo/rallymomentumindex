Pictures posted on Twitter showed protesters lying in a row across the M4 slip road to Heathrow beneath a banner which said: "This is a crisis."

A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said screens erected at the scene of the protest were to prevent distraction for motorists. Screens were also at the scene of the Heathrow incident, where video footage appeared to show a number of police officers moving the protesters while they continued to lie on the road. The day of action comes just a day after the anniversary of Mr Duggan's death. An inquest jury decided that Mr Duggan was lawfully killed by a police marksman. BLMUK describes itself as a network of anti-racist activists from across the UK. The group said: "We stand in solidarity with the families and friends of all who have died at the hands of the British state. We take action because justice has not been delivered through conventional means: the police, the IPCC, the courts or the legislature." The campaigners said they aim to highlight "the struggle for black lives in the UK and £Shutdown state-sanctioned racialised sexism, Islamophobia, classism, ableism, homophobia and transphobia", adding: "We fight for liberation." 1:08PM Heathrow calms down The disruption now seems to have come to an end at Heathrow: M4 Spur is open and traffic is returning to normal following earlier delays.— Heathrow Airport (@HeathrowAirport) August 5, 2016 Earlier the Met released this update on the number of arrests: Four people have been arrested and taken to west London police stations where they remain in custody. A further six people have been arrested at the scene. Police are in the process of safely releasing these protesters who have 'locked on' to each other. 11:22AM The protest in Nottingham Pictures in from Nottingham, where activists shut down part of the city centre tram and bus network to protest for social justice movement Black Lives Matter: Activists lay down in front of tram lines Credit: Edward Smith/PA Wire Police screen off protesters Credit: Edward Smith/PA Wire Nottingham Theatre Royal is shut down Credit: Edward Smith/PA Wire 10:54AM Twitter reacts The protests are getting short shrift from some users on Twitter: Trouble maker "Black Lives Matter UK "PROTESTING AGAINS WHAT ? pic.twitter.com/yyEewzV2ha— Mécréante (@franchescabonit) August 5, 2016 There doesn't have to be weekly shootings of black ppl in the UK for ppl to protest black lives matter here you know— Mike Lowry (@1__Oak) August 5, 2016 Why is "black lives matter" in the UK?

A spokesman for Nottinghamshire Police said the screens were erected to prevent distraction for motorists. #BlackLivesMatter protest in Nottingham. Police put up screens.

It would appear that the protesters are linked together in some way as the officers move them towards the side of the road as a group. Full #Shutdown in London. Motorway closed.

Q's almost reaching Heston Services.— TfL Traffic News (@TfLTrafficNews) August 5, 2016 10:17AM UKBLM issues statement Some explanation of the action from the group behind the protests, Black Lives Matter UK. In a press release issued this morning, a spokesperson said: This morning UKBLM have #Shutdown roads in London, Birmingham, Manchester and Nottingham to mourn those who have died in custody and to protest the ongoing racist violence of the police, border enforcement, structural inequalities and the everyday indignity of street racism. We have chosen today for our action to commemorate the fifth anniversary of Mark Duggan's death at the hands of the Metropolitan Police. We stand in solidarity with the families and friends of all who have died at the hands of the British state. We take action because justice has not been delivered through conventional means: the police, the IPCC, the courts or the legislature. UKBLM is a network of anti-racist activists from across the UK who believe deeply that #BlackLivesMatter. We believe the time is now for a Black Lives Matter movement in the UK to #Shutdown a nationwide crisis of racism. The group says they are "appalled and alarmed to see that in the UK": Black people are overrepresented by more than a factor of two for deaths in police custody since 1998. Black people are up to 37 times more likely to be stopped and searched than white people. Black people are three times more likely to be arrested than white people. Black people are 44% more likely to be detained under the mental health act than white people. Black people are three times more likely to be unemployed than white people. Black Caribbean pupils were almost four times more likely to be permanently excluded from school in 2009-10 than the school population as a whole. There has been a 57% increase in reported racist hate crimes since Brexit vote. 3132 black and brown people have drowned in the Mediterranean in 2016 alone. The statement adds: UKBLM aims to highlight the struggle for Black Lives in the UK and #Shutdown state-sanctioned racialised sexism, Islamophobia, classism, ableism, homophobia and transphobia. We fight for liberation. The struggle is global, so must be the solution. We are not affiliated with any political party (e.g. Socialist Party, Socialist Workers Party, or Labour). We work in co-ordination with anti-racist groups led by people of colour. 9:42AM Heathrow: Flights haven't been missed A Heathrow spokesman said the protest does not appear to be causing people to miss flights, adding: "Heathrow supports the right to peaceful protest within the law, but the safety and security of our passengers, aircraft and colleagues, together with the smooth running of the operation, is paramount. "We are sorry to those passengers whose journeys are being disrupted and we are working with the authorities to resolve the issue." This really isn't cool, guys. Not cool at all. #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/mpyUbyiD6B— Anna K Stiller (@dazdnconfused) August 5, 2016 9:40AM Protesters arrested Police said a number of people have been arrested at Heathrow following this morning's incident. A Scotland Yard spokesman said: "Police at Heathrow are dealing with a demo. We were called at 8.25am on the fifth to the M4 slip road at Heathrow airport. "A number of people were reported to be blocking the road leading to the airport. Officers have attended. A number of people have been arrested. One lane has been opened but there is traffic congestion. Police continue to deal with the situation at the scene." 9:39AM A national day of action This morning's Heathrow protest follows similar action on the A45 near Birmingham Airport and tram lines being blocked in Nottingham between Royal Centre and Market Square.
