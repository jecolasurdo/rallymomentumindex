Minneapolis activists were asked to meet at 3:30 p.m. Monday at Lake Street and 46th Avenue S., where they will rally for the release of a video of the November shooting of Jamar Clark, 24, by a Minneapolis police officer, as well as prosecution of the officers involved that bypasses a grand jury. Those demands have been at the heart of many protests by Black Lives Matter and its supporters, most prominently during an 18-day encampment at Fourth Precinct police headquarters. However, Lena Gardner, a spokeswoman for Black Lives Matter Minneapolis said Sunday that her group had not organized the event. In St. Paul, protesters will meet at the same time at Marshall and Otis avenues to demand that the case of Marcus Golden, shot by St. Paul police in early 2015, be reopened. A grand jury declined to indict the officers involved in that shooting. The two groups then will march toward each other and meet in the middle of the Lake Street-Marshall Avenue Bridge. The information was sent out in a news release Friday and posted on Facebook by the Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar. "The idea of the march is to pull together both cities ... that are only divided by the river but share the same kinds of injustices,” the group said.
