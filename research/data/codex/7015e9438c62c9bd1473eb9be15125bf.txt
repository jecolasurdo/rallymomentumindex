Author:Jenna WestPublish date:Aug 9, 2018The NFL preseason is underway, and player protests against police brutality and racial injustice have continued after many policy discussions during the offseason.In May, NFL owners voted to settle the national anthem debate by removing a requirement for players to be on the field during the national anthem.Under the new rule, players and team personnel need to stand and "show respect for the flag and the Anthem" when on the field. Anyone who chooses to not stand for the anthem can stay in the locker room. Teams will be fined by the league if someone does not "show respect" and can choose to punish their players as well.The NFLPA filed a grievance challenging the NFL's new anthem policy on July 10. Nine days later, the NFL and NFLPA released a joint statement saying that the two parties had reached "a standstill agreement" over the matter.After players protested Thursday night, the NFL released a statement, courtesty of NFL.com, to say that the league's anthem policy is still on hold during discussions with the NFLPA."The NFL has been engaged in constructive discussions with the NFL Players Association regarding the anthem and issues of equality and social justice that are of concern to many Americans. While those discussions continue, the NFL has agreed to delay implementing or enforcing any club work rules that could result in players being disciplined for their conduct during the performance of the anthem."Meanwhile, there has been no change in the NFL's policy regarding the national anthem. The anthem will continue to be played before every game, and all player and non-player personnel on the field at that time are expected to stand during the presentation of the flag and performance of the anthem. Personnel who do not wish to do so can choose to remain in the locker room."We remain committed to working with the players to identify solutions and to continue making progress on important social issues affecting our communities."Here is a list of players and teams that protested during the national anthem on Thursday and Friday:Steelers vs. EaglesThe Eagles' Malcolm Jenkins raised a fist during the anthem.
