Commemorates Juneteenth, Allows Larger Gatherings After hours of peaceful protests, a Boston police cruiser has been set on fire downtown. "Those now protesting in the streets of Boston have surrendered the moral high ground as efforts to hurt and harm police officers continue to intensify in our city," Boston police said on Twitter on Sunday night. "Men and women of BPD doing their best to restore order and keep the peace." State police said at one point an MBTA Transit Police cruiser responding to a report of an officer down was surrounded by "an aggressive and combative mob who began to strike the cruiser." They said troopers discharged pepper ball projectiles and were able to free the transit police cruiser. Protesters broke a glass door at an apartment building in Downtown Crossing. Several Boston police cruisers and storefronts were vandalized. There were also reports of looting at a Men's Warehouse store in the area and potted plants overturned outside Macy's.

Several other people were seen being led off in handcuffs by police throughout the night. At least one civilian was seen being taken away in an ambulance. After hours of a peaceful march, protestors turned on police around 9 p.m. Sunday. Mayor Marty Walsh thanked Boston police for their professionalism, while blasting those who caused a peaceful day to turn violent. "I am angered, however, by the people who came into our city and chose to engage in acts of destruction and violence, undermining their message," he said in a statement. "If we are to achieve change and if we are to lead the change, our efforts must be rooted in peace and regard for our community. Gov. Charlie Baker offered similar sentiments, calling those who looted and destroyed property "criminal and cowardly," while also praising police and those who protested peacefully. "The murder of George Floyd at the hands of police was a horrible tragedy -- one of countless tragedies to befall people of color across the United States. The vast majority of protesters today did so peacefully, toward a common goal of promoting justice and equality." The violence came hours after thousands of protesters marched to the Massachusetts State House on Sunday evening, adding their voices to the outrage across the nation. The protesters, many wearing masks, held signs and called for reforms following the death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck until he stopped breathing.

Chants of "No justice, no peace" and, simply, "Floyd," rang through the streets as throngs of protesters made their way to Beacon Hill. "I'm a black woman... and I have a son, so my prayers are different," one woman said. "I just want to be out here to represent, to make sure me -- as a black mom -- we've got to stand for something. "I'm not for the racism and violence anymore," she said. "I am here to stand up against police brutality," another woman said. "I am here for my black friends, my black family members, my black daughter... I am here to do what's right and not stay quiet." Boston Celtics guard Marcus Smart, among the crowd of protesters, told NBC Sports Boston's A. Sherrod Blakely, "We won't stop until we get justice."

Some held signs with messages including, "Black Lives Matter," "I can't breathe," "Enough is enough" and "How many more?"
