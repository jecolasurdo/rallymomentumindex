Jasmine Richards, 29, was found guilty of "attempting to unlawfully take a person from the lawful custody of a peace officer,” on June 2, according to the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. Richards was leading a protest on Sept. 2, 2015, at La Pintoresca Park when a woman approached the group after allegedly skipping the bill at a nearby restaurant. When police attempted to arrest the woman, Richards and some of the protesters tried to intervene. Judge Elaine Lu sentenced Richards to 90 days in jail, with 18 days credit for time served while in custody, and three years of probation. She was also ordered to attend anger management classes. The felony charge, protesters noted on social media, was previously referred to as "lynching” in the California penal code until July 2015. That's when Gov. Jerry Brown removed the word from the code following another incident in which a Black Lives Matters protester was arrested on the charge. The activists from both BLM and Color of Change delivered a petition with over 82,000 signatures to Lu, urging her to not sentence Richards to any jail time. They later gathered outside the court, writing letters of support to Richards and praying for her freedom. "It is our duty to fight for our freedom,” protesters chanted. "We have nothing to lose but our change.” Miranda Sheffield, a 30-year-old BLM organizer, was among the protesters. She said she was angry that police "are not being prosecuted” for shooting unarmed black people. "Then you have someone like Jasmine who's very vocal about the oppression of the people who ends up being prosecuted,” Sheffield said. "It makes you wonder what world we live in. But, I feel hopeful about the power of the people.” The protest Richards led was over the death of Kendrec McDade, who was shot by Pasadena police in 2012. In a report that year, the district attorney's office said officers acted lawfully when they shot McDade. The rally attracted residents from across the region. Thandiwe Bush, a 16-year-old student from Fontana, expressed her support for Richards with some performance art. "I feel like we made an impact with our presence, because without it everything would've remained the same,” she said. "I felt our ancestors flowing through me as I was dancing.” Melina Abdullah, a professor at Cal State L.A. and BLM organizer, spoke to the crowd when Richards' sentence was handed down. "The sentence of 90 days is unjust. She shouldn't have to do a day in jail,” Abdullah said. "What she did was for the people and we know that she was overcharged. A felony conviction is ridiculous in this case.” Abdullah said she was pleased that so many people attended the Tuesday rally. "Everyone should understand that the more people involved in the struggle, the safer we become,” she said. "We can't stop until we're all free.” Newsroom Guidelines News Tips Contact Us Report an Error Get the latest news delivered daily!
