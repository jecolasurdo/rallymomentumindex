Author: WBNS-10TV Staff Published: 1:44 PM EDT October 28, 2016 Updated: 10:30 PM EST November 15, 2016 COLUMBUS - A Unity march took place this afternoon to protest against police brutality. 30,000 individuals were invited via Facebook, 5,300 people indicated they were interested in attending. The march started at the corner of Goodale and High Street to Statehouse and then to the County Courthouse. But the marching stopped at Mound and High Streets. Police surrounded the traffic, halting demonstration. This caused protestors to chant with some lying down on the road. The mounted patrols and bike officers moved the crowd to the sidewalk. Protestors say they were being peaceful and were resentful of the police presence. "You've got snipers on top of buildings and you're encamped with a lot of officers, that's not a good thing,” Hyme Darson said. "As they decided to herd us through, they gave no regard for the fact that there were actual humans in front of them,” Jasmine Knox said. Police say some were punching at the horses which made them jump and officers sprayed mace. "They were trying to grab a guy and a few people were grabbing him back and he sprayed everybody,” Hana Abdurrahim said. Only one person was arrested and the demonstration continued. "The rallies, the marches, they get old if no change is brought about,” Darson said. Columbus Police say they have been holding community meetings and believe the best way to solve these issues would be to sit down and talk.
