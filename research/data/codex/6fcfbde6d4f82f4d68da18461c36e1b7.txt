And based on preliminary reports, it's going to be quite the spectacle. Rather than holding a large protest and potentially endanger participants due to the COVID-19 pandemic, organizers have decided to go with a tried and true solution that's become popular in other venues – a vehicle procession not unlike the birthday parades that have been taking place all spring. "It wasn't planned so much as it was watching the world taking part in this, that yes, the time is right,” said Paulette Snell, one of the event's organizers. "We have a diverse community here in Moose Jaw and I thought to myself, 'we have to do something'. We couldn't do anything big because of COVID-19, so the best way we could do it with authorization is by driving. "It's not a protest, it's solidarity, just bringing awareness.” Drivers will meet in the Town'n'Country Mall parking lot at 11 a.m., where Snell will deliver remarks before setting off. The route will head south on Main Street before turning right on Manitoba Street, travelling the Fourth Avenue bridge, turning right onto Lillooet St. West, right onto Ninth Northwest and ending at the Kinsmen Sportsplex. If there's any question as to Moose Jaw's support for the rally, get a load of this: as of Thursday night, a total of 160 vehicles had stated their intent to take part, with more signing on all the time. It's as heartening as can be for Snell, especially with all that has happened in the U.S. in recent weeks and the sorrow and pain that's come with it. "It is unbelievable, it's heartbreaking,” she said. "I cannot describe was is going on and what is still going on. Writing my speech, I've broken down so many times, and I know I will [Saturday], too. But I'll just take a breath and I will continue.” And she'll have all the help she needs to get through. "The community has been amazing, the support,” Snell said. "I have seniors who are on Facebook who are saying they can't be on Main Street, but they're asking what direction we're travelling so they can come out and just support us... it's so nice to have everyone wanting to help spread awareness of what is happening.” For more information, including a map of the route and the latest information, be sure to check out the Moose Jaw Solidarity Rally page on Facebook.
