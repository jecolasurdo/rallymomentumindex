The group eventually stopped about 3 p.m. near the rose garden at Peninsula Park, where they congratulated each other for working together to have their voices heard and staying peaceful.Along the way there, the group chanted "Not my president," "Peaceful protest," "Black Lives Matter" and other mantras as they traveled along the Hawthorne Bridge. Some students climbed the structure, but others persuaded them to stay lawful and get down.The group continued into Southeast Portland and went into the Lloyd Center mall. They walked to the Moda Center, chanting "Whose streets? Our streets" as they approached the arena. Later, they held a four-and-a-half minute moment of silence while sitting in the streets about a mile away to commemorate the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and urged other students to join them while stopped at Benson and Jefferson high schools."This is honestly the best thing I've seen all week," said Shay Emmons, who saw the protest pass near the gym she owns on Southeast 6th Avenue and Madison Street and applauded participants. "It makes me want to cry, I'm so happy right now."Portland police officers gave out stickers resembling badges to students, helped keep them off MAX tracks and helped defuse at least one dispute, in which a a woman chanted "President Trump," at the protesters. She pointed thumbs down and repeated, "We won, you lost" and "All lives matter." Students shouted back at her and continued their march. Police, some parents and other adults traveled throughout the protest with the group, which at its highest numbered about 400.Peter Fink, a Cleveland sophomore, said he was demonstrating "because Hillary won the popular vote.""She won by more than 1.7 million votes, and that's not right," Fink said, adding, that's not a democracy, "that's a republic, and I want a democracy."Anna Jackson, 33, of Portland was one of several adults who walked with students. The mother of a 13-year-old eighth-grader at DaVinci Middle School, she met up with her daughter at Portland City Hall, and they walked with protesters until the end of the march.Jackson said she stayed with the students to make sure they were safe, and she helped separate them from the woman chanting in opposition."I think freedom of speech ends when you start oppressing someone," Jackson said. "At worst, you should be locked up. At best, you should receive counseling." Jackson said she was proud of the students for protesting without violence. "They accomplished something the adults in this city haven't done yet."Tony Hernandez and Beth Nakamura of The Oregonian/OregonLive staff contributed to this report.-- Everton Bailey Jr.ebailey@oregonian.com503-221-8343; @EvertonBaileyNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).Â© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
