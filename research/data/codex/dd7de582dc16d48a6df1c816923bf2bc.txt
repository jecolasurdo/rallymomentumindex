WatchWorkforce AllianceYale EventsYMCAYouth ContinuumSubscribe to the NHI Newsletter White Coats Kneel For Black Livesby Emily Hays | Jun 5, 2020 5:30 pm (8) Comments | Commenting has been closed | E-mail the AuthorPosted to: Black Lives Matter, Health, The Hill, Covid-19 As New Haveners prepared a mass march, around 300 doctors took a knee in front of the Yale School of Medicine to demonstrate their solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement.Yale pediatricians organized the protest as part of a national movement called White Coats for Black Lives. Similar protests occurred around the country at the same time. "We are here today because we recognize that our health care system is one of the many systems contributing to structural racism,” said one of the organizers, Yale New Haven Hospital resident Molly Markowitz (pictured).Doctors and doctors-in-training pulled on their white coats and amassed at the Sterling Hall of Medicine. So many joined that they spilled onto Cedar Street. Another 280 or so tuned in via Zoom. Another protest organizer, Yale pediatrician Tanya Murtha (pictured), took the megaphone briefly to remind those present to step as far apart from one another as possible. Murtha had asked everyone to wear masks and assemble outside to diminish the risks of spreading coronavirus among the protesters."We thought about how do we do this in a way that honors the current situation? We do not want to be talking out of two sides of our mouth,” Murtha said.Murtha said that she had wanted to take action in response to the killing of George Floyd by a Minnesota police officer. She said that hearing Floyd call to his mother in his final breaths helped spark her need to protest."It drove home for me how I don't have to worry about my boys being safe every single day,” Murtha said.She heard about White Coats for Black Lives and liked the idea of using her position to amplify others' voices.After a few minutes milling around, the speeches began. Each protest organizer made a few quick remarks and then handed the megaphone to the protest's central speaker, YNHH resident Amanda J. Calhoun. "I'm glad you're here, but I have to ask — where have you been and will you stay?” said Calhoun (pictured above).Calhoun described seeing doctors deny the racism their patients were experiencing both in their lives and at the hospital itself. She said that a higher-up had deleted her notes after she had witnessed a possible act of racism in the hospital. She called on those at the protest to listen to their black colleagues and patients and let them know that they are safe people to talk to about racism and white supremacy."All of your black patients experience racism. If they have not told you, it is because they do not trust you,” she said.Calhoun talked about the importance of understanding racism to be able to do their work. She said that she hopes those teaching about health disparities between black and white Americans put them in the context of 400 years of structural racism that African Americans did not create. She said that class examples of African American patients should not all be poor, single mothers and that drug addiction should not be discussed without statistics that white Americans use more drugs but African Americans are more likely to be arrested. Calhoun paused at points to gather herself and members of the crowd cheered, "We love you, Amanda!” She received such a roaring applause at the end of her speech that she did a small, joking bow.Then Murtha asked those present to kneel in a moment of silence. Calhoun has lost one of her own family members to Covid-19. She said that as a frontline worker she has not had time to grieve her uncle, who sang at her wedding and was one of the biggest supporters of her activism. She said that he would have attended on Zoom if he were alive."I constantly wonder if his death could have been prevented if we did not have racist systems in place,” Calhoun said.Calhoun said that diabetes and hypertension are some of the pre-existing conditions that can lead to worse Covid-19 outcomes. She said that lack of access to nutritious food and the stress from racism lead to these diseases, which are disproportionately present in African American communities. YNHH resident physician Windy Grant (pictured right above) attended the protest instead of sleeping after her night shift. She said that she wants to see a change in the health care system and see health professionals become more aware of the power of their words."I had to be here,” said Grant. When the moment of silence ended, doctors and residents took pictures with one another. YNHH ear, nose and throat resident Janet Chao (pictured with the "Surgeons for Black Lives” sign) said that she identifies some with the barriers that her black coworkers experience, even in attempting to climb the medical career ladder. She said that she attended the rally to support Black Lives Matter and in the hopes of preventing future systemic racism."We don't talk enough about how racism affects health,” Chao said.

The people are so much better than the institutions that have failed. Time to push for BIG change and not gestures.posted by: Username06443 on June 5, 2020 7:17pmThese doctors and nurses continually treat and quite often save the lives of black and brown victims of gun violence in and around New Haven. They deserve our praise and respect.These same doctors and nurses rarely, if ever, treat any person shot or otherwise assaulted by law enforcement.Love to see the numbers for these two scenarios. If I'm wrong, surely somebody will produce factual evidence to the contrary.The point, however, is that the George Floyd death deserves protest directed at those responsible and their conduct, rather than engaging in a boutique demonstration that frankly has no connection to what took place in Minnesota.Now a demonstration decrying the ongoing assaults by non-law enforcement upon black and brown victims would be more appropriate.posted by: cunningham on June 5, 2020 7:53pm@Username06443Police officers are public servants employed by the state. Protest is how people petition their government for a redress of grievance.Urban crime is a problem with myriad problems and solutions. And, in fact, the Yale medical community is active in trying to solve gun violence and other crime through research and advocacy. Three examples it took me only seconds to find: https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/18869/ https://medicine.yale.edu/news-article/19740/ https://news.yale.edu/2017/01/04/yale-study-finds-gun-violence-contagious-social-epidemicThe "black on black crime” trope is worn out and offensive. Find something a little more constructive or shut up and let people try to make the country a bit better.posted by: William Kurtz on June 5, 2020 9:05pmWhat cunningham said. I yield my remaining 1941 characters.posted by: Pat Wallace on June 5, 2020 10:31pmOne current thing to consider is the plan to add substantial additional garage space and traffic to the St Raphael Campus in the middle of New Haven's lowest income neighborhood with 2400 school bus stops and and a high asthma rate, and a high minority population. Be allies of the Dwight neighborhood.posted by: DawnBli on June 6, 2020 7:18amWhat a truly decent thing to do...you all are what Yale should be. Not above and not better than but rather a part of this community...posted by: Heather C. on June 6, 2020 1:35pmWe must all work together to make this world a better, safer and healthier place. If you don't have constructive, helpful and positive suggestions for how to help, and you only want to assign blame, then you're part of the problem. If you just want to be part of the current trend of protesting, and you don't take a good hard look at how racism is present in your everyday life and is all around you, and you don't take steps to counteract prejudice in your lives and workplaces and in everyday interactions, then you're not part of the solution.posted by: Jkeefe on June 6, 2020 6:35pmI lived in NH decades ago, which caused me to scan this. Recall seeing the protests outside the Bobby Seale trial. Not much has changed at Yale, unfortunately. Never knew how structurally racist our health care system was.Also sorry to hear that one person here is tired of the black-on-black crime "trope” and demands a more constructive dialogue. Don't want to hurt his feelings by telling him that black-on-black crime in Chicago last weekend was greater than cop-on-black crime in MN by an order of magnitude.
