About 25 protesters picketed a building that houses the officers of the city's largest police union Wednesday morning. Ten protesters showed up at about 8 a.m. at 125 Broad St., and tried to get up to the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association's offices but were blocked at the lobby turnstiles by security, witnesses said.

In all, about 30 people participated in the protest, which was organized by the Black Youth Project 100 and a Million Hoodies.

Williams/New York Daily News) The groups said they want to "defund" the PBA because it "protects and defends" cops who kill black people, according to a spokesman. One protester called the PBA a "fake a-- union." The PBA is funded by members' dues. They also demanded the NYPD fire Officer Wayne Isaacs, who shot and killed Delrawn Small in Brooklyn on July 4 during a road rage confrontation. The protesters carried signs which read, "PBA protects killer cops" and "Stop cops, fund black futures."

They should be supporting the police officers, who are out here protecting their right to protest."

Organizers said the protest will be followed by a "national day of action" Thursday.
