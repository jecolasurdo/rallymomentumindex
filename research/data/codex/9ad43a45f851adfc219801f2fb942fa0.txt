(WSAW) -- A COVID-19 outbreak in Portage County didn't stop protesters from having their message heard in Stevens Point on Sunday. Black Lives Matter protesters gathered downtown Stevens Point on June 7, 2020 (WSAW photo) The Black Lives Matter protest was originally canceled due to the COVID-19 outbreak announced by Portage County Health officials on Friday, but organizers say they had a change of heart and went forward.Several hundreds lined up along Centerpoint Drive and Water Street in Stevens Point. Organizers say it was important to have this protest. "I shouldn't have to fear leaving my house. I shouldn't have to have a police officer stop me because I'm black,” said Reggie Eaton, who helped organize the event. "This matters because all lives matter, but black lives matter right now. We're being persecuted, we're being shot, we're being murdered for no reason. It matters because this matters to someone, and that someone might be me. If a protest starts the conversation, I'm willing to start it.” The protesters on Centerpoint Drive were mostly showing support in the form of silent protest, but that tone changed heading up Water Street, with many chanting and making their voices heard before marching to the downtown square. "We don't want our voices to be silenced. We want everyone to feel like they're welcome in their communities and we want everyone to feel like they have a voice," said Jessica Harlan, another organizer. Tim Conway attended the protest with his family. He says that he is glad that the organizers didn't let the fear of COVID-19 and online threats keep them from sharing such an important message. "We want to support the movement from across this nation that black lives matter,” Conway said. "We're trying to make a change, a real change. We want to make a change in our communities, we want to make a change for our children, our grandchildren.” When asked what that change would look like, Conway said when all people are treated equal. "I don't care what your skin color is,” Conway explained. "I come to you in love and peace.” Reketa Hatter was at the protest with her four children. She says the large turnout was a positive sign. "It gives me a lot of hope,” Hatter said. "There's all kinds of different people out here supporting the Black Lives Matter movement.” There was one tense moment during the afternoon, with several pickup trucks entering the square with American and Trump 2020 flags flying from the back of their trucks. The protesters seemed to feel as though the group of vehicles was trying to antagonize them. Lt. Detective Bob Kussow with the Stevens Point Police Department immediately approached the trucks and spoke with the drivers, deescalating the situation. "I just asked them to respect what these individuals are down here for because they're passionate about the topic, which they should be, and I didn't want them antagonizing anybody or causing any disturbance,” explained Lt. Kussow, who said the drivers respected that request. "The said 'absolutely, we understand that, we're just kind of doing our First Amendment right as well.'” Lt. Kussow said as a whole the event was a success with no incidents being reported. He credited the organizers for keeping the Stevens Point Police Department in the loop to help make sure the event remained peaceful. Protesters from all around Wisconsin were in attendance, with some saying they came from as far as Green Bay and Milwaukee to participate.
