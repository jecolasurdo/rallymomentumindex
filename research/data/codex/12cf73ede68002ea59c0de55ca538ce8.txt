Contribute Idahoans condemn deadly white nationalist violence in Virginia By Nicole Blanchard and Ruth Brown Idaho Statesman Kendra Evensen Aug 14, 2017 Aug 14, 2017 Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Ashley Brown holds a sign calling for acceptance of neighbors at a Sunday vigil at the Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial in Boise. Protesters gathered to condemn Saturday's deadly racist violence in Virginia. Ruth Brown/Idaho Statesman Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Government officials, church leaders and many others are speaking out against white supremacy and other forms of racism as the nation continues to mourn victims of weekend violence in Charlottesville, Virginia.Several hundred people gathered at the Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial in Boise on Sunday evening, holding signs condemning hatred and promoting unity. Jean Heinz, of Boise, was among them.Heinz held a posterboard on Sunday that read "We will continue to fight for you” under an image of Heather Heyer, the woman who died Saturday in Charlottesville. × Story continues below video Heinz has three daughters — one of whom is about the same age as 32-year-old Heyer, who was struck by a car during a counter-protest against white nationalism."We cannot just stand by anymore,” Heinz said. "I do not support white supremacy and this must stop.”Ashley Brown attended Sunday's vigil because she was especially disturbed by the escalating violence. Brown held a sign that promoted loving your neighbors, no matter their race, nationality or sexual orientation."I've been really disturbed by the events taking place in the last eight months,” Brown said. "I don't think it represents our community as a whole and we need to show who we are as a society. We need to recognize our history and try to move forward.”Others held signs reading "Too Great for Hate,” "Black Lives Matter” and "Make America Kind Again.”Kelly Miller, executive director of the Idaho Coalition Against Sexual and Domestic Violence, who attended the vigil, held a yellow "Black Lives Matter” banner. Miller said violence anywhere only contributes to violence in Idaho."We need to be much more visible when we condemn violence,” Miller said. "I'm glad there's a lot of white folks here, too. We need to work together because we're not a superior race, we're not a superior people and we all need to work together if we want to see this violence end.”Adrienne Evans, director of United Vision for Idaho, was one of the organizers of the vigil."It's incumbent upon all of us to stand up for our country, against systemic racism,” Evans said. "This (is) a moment where we set all of our egos aside and do what's best for our country.”Phillip Thompson, executive director for the Black History Museum, spoke at the vigil, saying incidents such as the ones in Charlottesville have become far too common."Complacency is no longer acceptable,” said Thompson. "This hatred arises from a narrow-mindedness and unwillingness to respect those who are deemed 'the other.' We cannot practice this same narrow-mindedness by refusing to work with those who may hold a different political philosophy or ideology. We may disagree on a variety of fronts, but we must agree to stay united against hatred.” Church leaders and Idaho's members of Congress are also speaking out against racism following the incidents in Charlottesville.The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints released a statement on Sunday."It is with great sadness and deep concern that we view the violence, conflict, and tragedy of recent days in Charlottesville, Virginia,” according to the statement. "People of any faith, or of no faith at all, should be troubled by the increase of intolerance in both words and actions that we see everywhere.”The statement went on to quote late church President Gordon B. Hinckley, who taught, "No man who makes disparaging remarks concerning those of another race can consider himself a true disciple of Christ. Nor can he consider himself to be in harmony with the teachings of the Church of Christ.”Church officials say they reaffirm that teaching today, and they reminded people of the Savior's admonition to love their neighbor."Our prayers are with those who are suffering because of this intolerance and hatred. We pray for peace and for understanding. Above all, we pray that we may treat one another with greater kindness, compassion, and goodness,” according to the statement.On Sunday, U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho Falls, also offered his condolences to victims in Charlottesville and thanked first-responders in a Facebook statement that earned him an outpouring of thanks from commenters."White supremacy and their hateful rhetoric and violence have no place in this country. Let today unite our nation against this evil rather than allow it to be divided by a petulant minority that does not represent the values of America,” Simpson said.Sen. Mike Crapo echoed that sentiment Sunday afternoon."Yesterday's tragedy in Virginia was the result of domestic terrorism. I condemn and reject the racism and hate perpetuated by white supremacist groups,” Crapo said in a statement. "In the wake of this horrific tragedy, let us gather in solidarity with those who lost loved ones and draw closer the families whose lives have been forever shattered by Saturday's events.”Sen. Jim Risch also issued a statement on Monday.He called the "hateful acts of racism” that occurred in Charlottesville reprehensible, and said he condemns them in the strongest terms."White supremacy — and every other form of prejudice — does not represent our American values,” he said in the statement. "Vicki joins me in praying for the families of those who lost their lives and for those who were injured.”The Idaho State Journal contributed to this report.
