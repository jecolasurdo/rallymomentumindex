As the racially and ethnically diverse crowd of mostly young people stood in the shade of the park's big trees, a handful of speakers stood on a picnic table and called for an end to systemic racism and police brutality. "I'm treated differently because of the color of my skin. I am treated differently because of what I look like,” Michael Staine, a 20-year-old La Habra resident, said from the makeshift stage. "The way someone acts is not a color,” he said. "Judge (people) by the content of their character, not by the color of their skin.” A diverse crowd of at least 200 people gathered in La Habra's La Bonita Park on Wednesday, June 3, to support the Black Lives Matter movement in the wake of the Memorial Day death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

Some read "Black Lives Matter,” while others had more specific messages: "Latinx 4 black lives,” read one; "I'm not black, but I see you. I'm not black, but I hear you,” read part of another. Several others stood up to discuss the need to support the black community and to treat all people with respect. Some expressed disgust at casual racism they encounter day-to-day. "Black lives, brown lives, they're dropping like flies out there,” said Alexis Vigil, a student at Cal State Fullerton. "All lives can't matter till black lives matter,” she told the audience. "When black people push for their rights, it affects everybody.” Organizer Amanda Quinonez, 18, said she was pleased that her call to gather, which she posted to Instagram, spread to other social media platforms and that so many people came out to show support for black lives and protest racial injustices. "Everything went just as planned,” she said. "It's such a beautiful thing to see.” Related Articles George Floyd protests raise Juneteenth's profile across Southern California LAPD investigating San Gabriel attorney for allegedly calling for cop killings Atlanta officer who shot Rayshard Brooks charged with felony murder Aunt Jemima brand retired by Quaker due to racial stereotype; Uncle Ben's 'evolving' Protests Wednesday in LA, Hollywood, North Hollywood, Sherman Oaks, Boyle Heights, Los Feliz, Santa Monica, Palmdale The demonstration, called the "La Habra Black Lives Matter Protest,” began around 12:30 p.m. at El Centro-Lions Park.
