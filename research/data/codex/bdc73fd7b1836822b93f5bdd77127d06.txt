The diverse crowds were peaceful, but not quiet. As they chanted the names of the recently killed, passing cards honked in support."What I'm hoping is that this brought awareness,” said Burrell. "Hopefully, people will understand that the Michael Brown shooting could have happened anywhere.”Brown, a 18-year-old from Ferguson, Mo., was shot and killed by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson earlier this month. He was unarmed at the time.The killing has since led to significant unrest and protests throughout the St. Louis metro area. Accounts of the shooting vary between police and witnesses.In July, Eric Garner of Staten Island died after he was put into a chokehold by a NYPD officer.The deaths have started a national discussion about police tactics, and the relationship between police and the communities they serve.Participants at Thursday night's rally, Burrell included, commended Highland Park police for maintaining public safety during the march. But one young resident, who asked that his name be withheld, said he decided to attend the march to protest police "lack of respect.”Asked if there is tension between local youth of color and Highland Park police, Burell said that there's "friction,” but not hostility. "I think you see that in every town, but overall I think Highland Park is in a good place right now,” he said.At a short rally following the march, Burrell and others discussed plans to work with police to produce workshops to strengthen the law enforcement community's relationship with local residents of color.""Hopefully it can be a stepping stone towards building a better relationship,” Burrell said.MORE MIDDLESEX COUNTY NEWSVernal Coleman can be reached at vcoleman@njadvancemedia.com.
