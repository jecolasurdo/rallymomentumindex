Print ESCONDIDO — About 500 people protested for social justice outside Escondido City Hall and briefly marched through surrounding downtown streets Friday as demonstrations continued in locations throughout San Diego County.The protest was organized online mostly by Orange Glen High School students and was the third day of protests in the city this week."I'm pretty surprised,” said Rayne Cantero, a 17-year-old junior at Orange Glen, as she looked at the large crowd. "We're just a couple of high school students.” A large group of protestors peacefully demonstrated in front of Escondido City Hall showing support for Black Lives Matter on Friday, June 5, 2020. (Nelvin C. Cepeda / The San Diego Union-Tribune) Advertisement Cantero said the idea came from an online group chat with friends who wanted to do their part for social justice.The city's first protest this week was Monday outside Escondido Police Department headquarters, where Chief Ed Varso and at least one other officer joined demonstrators and knelt in a moment of silence. Varso also took a knee with protesters on Wednesday at Escondido City Hall during another demonstration.On Friday, the police chief walked past and chatted with the hundreds of protesters on the corner of Broadway and West Valley Parkway, and one officer carried a case of bottled water into the crowd as temperatures rose in the mid-afternoon. Several hundred protestors marched to the intersection of Valley Parkway and Escondido Blvd. in Escondido on Friday, June 5, 2020, where they took a knee to honor George Floyd. The peaceful group then listened to Lovestar Jean Baptiste who addressed the large group.(Nelvin C. Cepeda / The San Diego Union-Tribune) Advertisement The demonstration did not include any scheduled speeches by organizers or guests, although some people attending did use a megaphone to lead chants or briefly address the crowd."I'm glad you're here,” Margit Moigaard-Bodstrup, 65, said to the youthful crowd as she tried to be heard over passing motorists who honked horns in support. "You are our hope.”Moigaard-Bodstrup, an Escondido resident and the county's only Danish, Norway and Swedish court interpreter, said she was inspired by the crowd. During the peaceful demonstration in Escondido on Friday, June 5. 2020, one woman braced her sign on her head. The demonstrators peacefully marched the nearby streets of Escondido near City Hall, where they later took a knee to honor George Floyd.(Nelvin C. Cepeda / The San Diego Union-Tribune) Advertisement "I think that the tides are changing,” she said, recalling how the Rev. Al Sharpton also had commented on the encouragement he felt by seeing many young, white people protesting on behalf of the Black Lives Matter movement during the eulogy for George Floyd the day before.One young man who spoke through the megaphone had told the crowd that together, they could cause a lot of damage to the status quo, but not by rioting or looting, but rather by voting.Another young woman who urged protesters to remain peaceful held a sign that read, "Looters & vandals not wanted. We're better than that.”The protest began around 2 p.m., and participants continued to arrive throughout the afternoon. About two hours into the demonstration, people began marching west on West Valley Parkway and spilled off the sidewalk and into the street about halfway down the block. Advertisement A police car followed, but did not disrupt the march. Instead, officers stopped their vehicle in the street to block traffic and allow the march to continue. Protesters turned left a block away and made another left at Grand Avenue, where windows on many businesses had been boarded up. "This is beautiful, brother, Escondido resident Samy Watson said while watching the marchers from across the street. "There's so much hatred in the world, we need to be doing something about it.”Watson, who is black, said it was amazing to see so many young white people marching with signs supporting Black Lives Matter and protesting police abuse."It means people are paying attention,” he said. Advertisement His life-long friend Jered Landreth stood by his side and also was touched by the demonstration."This is what it takes to make changes,” Landreth said. "It's very refreshing to see the youth out here taking a stand.”Landreth, who is white, said he had seen Watson be racially profiled over the years."They used to have me drive the car so we'd get pulled over less.” he said. Advertisement Doug Paulson, a member of the Escondido Union School District Board of Trustees and an Orange Glen High teacher, also attended the protest. "I'm here today in support for all people, but more than that, I'm here to see what happens with this community and to see if there's anything I can do for it to remain productive and peaceful,” he said.Daniel Collins of Vista showed up to the protest carrying a Gadsden flag and wearing an shirt with American flags. Some protesters made some derogatory comments as they assumed he was there to disrupt the demonstration, but he said he was on their side."This flag means dissatisfaction with the government,” he said. Collins lifted his shirt sleeve to show bruises on his arm that he said were caused by rubber bullets fired at him when he demonstrated in Los Angeles earlier this week.
