ROBERT MORAN / Staff At least 10 people were arrested as "Black Lives Matter" protesters blocked two ramps off the Vine Street Expressway, snarling Center City traffic during the Wednesday evening commute. The protest was sparked by the fatal shooting of Alton Sterling, an African American man, during a scuffle with two white police officers in Baton Rouge, La., on Tuesday. Cellphone video of the deadly encounter went viral late Tuesday. Related stories Ubiñas: In Philly and Baton Rouge, are tears all we have left?

"We want to be the change, not just talk about it," she said afterward. SEPTA Transit Police Chief Thomas J. Nestel 3rd live-tweeted the entire event. "Protest headed WB on Walnut from 12th. Peaceful expression of the 1st Amendment occurring in Philadelphia," Nestel tweeted at one point. "The protest expressing anger with the death of Alton Sterling is peaceful in the Birthplace of America," Nestel tweeted later. After nearly an hour, the protesters reached the off-ramp from I-676 onto 15th Street and were able to make their way down part of the ramp, also climbing a barrier and blocking the on-ramp from 16th Street. Some cars were temporarily trapped on the off-ramp, but police were able to guide them back to the expressway. The protesters shouted chants and cursed the dozens of officers who prevented them from getting farther down the ramps, but there was no physical violence. At least 10 protesters sat in a row at the on-ramp, intending to get arrested. They were given three warnings to leave and then were taken away one by one. 4th arrest pic.twitter.com/0CgUeLi7bn— Robert Moran (@RobertMoran215) July 6, 2016 Last arrest, total of at least 10 pic.twitter.com/N9jipK5153— Robert Moran (@RobertMoran215) July 7, 2016 Chief Inspector Joseph Sullivan, who was at the scene supervising the police response, said the protesters would be cited with obstructing the highway and then released sometime overnight. "We're professionals. We recognize that people have a right to say what they want," Sullivan said. "That's what makes this country great, the First Amendment, right to free speech, and our job is to protect that right. "They may be protesting against us, but it's still our responsibility to protect them, and that's what we did here today." bmoran@phillynews.com 215-854-5983@RobertMoran215 Posted: July 6, 2016 - 10:11 PM Robert Moran, Staff Writer Inquirer Morning Newsletter Get the news you need to start your day Sign Up Inquirer Morning Newsletter We Recommend Inquirer Morning Newsletter Get the news you need to start your day Sign Up Inquirer Morning Newsletter twitter facebook instagram News & Info News / Sports / Entertainment / Business / Health / Food / Life / Opinion / Archives / Special Reports About Us About The Philadelphia Inquirer / Advertise / Contact Us / Licensing & Permissions / Photo Reprints / Newspapers in Education / Jobs & Internships / Inquirer Events / Acel Moore Workshops / Newsroom Staff Marketplace Inquirer Store / Find a Home / Job Listings / Special Sections / All Classifieds / Gift Subscriptions Mobile Apps Inquirer News / Philly Sports Now News & Info News Sports Entertainment Business Health Food Life Opinion Archives Special Reports Marketplace Inquirer Store Find a Home Job Listings Special Sections All Classifieds Gift Subscriptions Mobile Apps Inquirer News Philly Sports Now About Us About The Philadelphia Inquirer Advertise Contact Us Licensing & Permissions Photo Reprints Newspapers in Education Jobs & Internships Inquirer Events Acel Moore Workshops Newsroom Staff The Inquirer Digital Edition Subscribe Subscriber Services The Daily News Digital Edition Subscribe Subscriber Services The Inquirer Digital Edition Subscribe Subscriber Services The Daily News Digital Edition Subscribe Subscriber Services © 2020 The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLC Terms of Use/Privacy Policy © 2020 The Philadelphia Inquirer, LLC Terms of Use/Privacy Policy
