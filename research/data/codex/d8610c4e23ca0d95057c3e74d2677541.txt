In a show of inclusivity and solidarity, volunteers painted "All Black Lives Matter” in the middle of the busy Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue intersection on Saturday to honor black LGBTQ+ people and the fight for justice nationwide. (Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images) The message was painted in assorted colors that represent diversity in the LGBTQ+ community, including the colors of the Rainbow flag and Transgender Pride Flag. Similarly, earlier this month, Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser had "Black Lives Matter” painted in yellow on a street leading to White House. An All Black Lives Matter march is set to take place in Los Angeles on Sunday starting at 11 a.m. at Hollywood and Highland. "The protest is in direct response to racial injustice, systemic racism, and all forms of oppression,” ABLM said on its website. "The LGBTQ+ community must extend its support to unite against oppression, police brutality, racism, transphobia, and the many other disparities disproportionately impacting the Black community.” Comments (38) Boomer Boomer says: June 14, 2020 at 8:41 am So, they received a green light to deface public roadways? Reply Dan R says: June 14, 2020 at 2:56 pm I want my name painted on every street in America and at every church there must be an alter to bow down to an image of me. If everyone behaves I will not require that my image be placed on all the US money instead of just replacing George Washington on the $1 bill. Maybe I want to be on the $100 bill and replace Benjamin Franklin. He was never a president anyhow. I don't think there is another non-president on any bills. I want The Donald on one, maybe on the $5 replacing Lincoln. George Washington is on the quarter too. He has plenty going for him.

Reply Oveida Sinclair says: June 15, 2020 at 7:43 am I totally agree with you, if they have it so bad and they're so upset about their forefathers being slaves, give a thousand dollars and a one way no return ticket to Liberia where they came from Reply Bob J says: June 14, 2020 at 5:10 pm Having this social media on public streets is reverse racism. The streets are meant for all and not some private feelings hurt minority group. This will backfire. Reply David A says: June 14, 2020 at 5:40 pm including the black fetuses killed in abortions? Reply Oveida Sinclair says: June 15, 2020 at 7:45 am I say open an abortion clinic on every predominate Black street Reply Tom Roberts says: June 14, 2020 at 6:07 pm I hope someone paints White Live Don't Matter on the walls of the crematorium where the city burns their white homeless population 24 hours per day. Of course there are no headlines since dying and being cremated are better than living in a gutter. Can we build some housing before letting in more cheap labor? I know our generous leaders would gladly provide a very generous 6 by 6 foot square for each worker if only other workers would pay the tax bills.
