Reginald Walton organized the event. He is chair of the Black Lives Matter Arizona chapter, as well as pastor of the Phillips Memorial C.M.E. Church."There's so much going on, we felt we needed to stand in solidarity with our friends who are fighting for justice and fighting for rights," Walton said.People mingled before and after the event, which lasted about an hour and drew little attention from passers-by.Activist J.J.

Johnson and Rabbi Shmuly Yanklowitz spoke at the event.Johnson invoked 27-year-old Loreal Tsingine, who was shot and killed March 27 by Winslow police Officer Austin Shipley after she was suspected of shoplifting a case of beer."Arizona is becoming ground zero for racial craziness," Ledermann said to applause. " I come here to stand next to and support my brothers and my sisters who are fighting for equality."The event was supplemental, Walton said, to a rally set for later in the day at Margaret T. Hance Park in Phoenix, where Living United for Change in Arizona (LUCHA) supporters will demand a $15 minimum wage and union rights for Arizona workers.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://azc.cc/1Sdoj8wFind JobsShare your feedback to help improve our site experience!
