After marching around Eagan's police station, 18 people spoke passionately to the City Council and Eagan Mayor Mike Maguire about the toll incurred on their lives and community from Isak's loss. Unicorn Riot sat down with Sumaya and Badrudin, two of Isak's siblings, for an exclusive interview after the fiery protest. Family members, friends, activists, organizers, educators, and concerned community members met the evening of July 16, 2019 at the building which houses Eagan's City Hall and Police Department. Rousing speeches were made, then the crowd, lifting forth a massive "Justice 4 Isak” banner, marched down roadways, clogging rush-hour traffic in the southern St. Paul suburb. The angered crowd eventually entered the Eagan city building chanting "Justice for Isak!” and took over the City Council Chambers. #BREAKING: Community members chanting "Justice for Isak” have taken over the city hall in Eagan, Minnesota.

Hussein said that the crowd protesting for Isak would also seek justice for any of the sons of the council members, if they were the ones being killed by police. Hussein pressed the Council members to release all of the video evidence to the public. Another speaker, Michelle Gross, founder of Communities United Against Police Brutality, said that it is within their rights to carry out this request: "Under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act 13.82 Subdivision 15, you have the right as the originating agency of that data, to release that data.” Speakers have been moved up in the Eagan City Council meeting agenda.

The message was a touching tribute to who Isak was, someone that "would go out of his way, whether it was to just advise you or even loan you a couple grand.” Sumaya Aden read a text message from one of her brother's friends to the Eagan City Council on Tuesday. Her brother #IsakAden was shot and killed by 5 officers on July 2, one of them being Jacob Peterson, an Eagan officer who had killed #ZacharyPremo in #Duluth in 2013. pic.twitter.com/1YWwe2dma6 — Unicorn Riot (@UR_Ninja) July 18, 2019 Badrudin, Isak's brother, who was at the scene of Isak's death, spoke to the City Council about the officers that were involved in killing his brother. Four of the officers who shot and killed Isak were from the Bloomington Police Department (Anthony Kiehl, Daniel Nelson, Matt Ryan, Adam Stier) and was one from the Eagan Police Department (Jacob Peterson). Aden explained to the City Council how two of the officers, Anthony Kiehl, of Bloomington Police, and Jacob Peterson of Eagan Police had already killed people in the recent past. Anthony Kiehl killed 24-year-old Quincy Reindl in Bloomington, MN in 2015. Jacob Peterson killed 26-year-old Zachary Premo in Duluth, MN in 2013. "Putting officers who have a previous past of being involved in fatal shootings on the frontline of a situation that sensitive, tells you what kind of mindset they had going into this.” – Sumaya Aden Badrudin was at the scene of his brother's death on July 2, 2019. He said that after the sheer number of gunshots he'd heard, he "immediately knew it was over” for his brother. Badrudin (l) and Sumaya Aden (r) spoke to Unicorn Riot after the disruption of the City Council meeting According to the police, they were called to a domestic disturbance in Eagan. Isak is reported to have run to a wooded area and a parking lot where a standoff ensued for several hours.

At some point in the night, five police officers shot and killed Isak, while two officers fired with non-lethal rounds.
