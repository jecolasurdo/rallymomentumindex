Now one Agawam mom brought her 9-year-old daughter to this protest to support the 'Black Lives Matter' movement."If black lives don't matter, no lives matter. Because they're basically the same, but they only have different colors, which they should be treated the same," said a protester's 9-year-old daughter."I feel it's important she knows what's going on in the world and she said she wanted to come with me so I brought her. It's her mind and she agrees that black lives matter," said Agawam protester.Now the organizers told Western Mass News they held speeches at the high school and began their march to the police station at 6:15 p.m. Copyright 2020 Western Mass News (Meredith Corporation).
