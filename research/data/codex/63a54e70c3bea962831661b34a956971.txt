(Steve Schering/Pioneer Press) A group of about 100 Oak Park and River Forest High School students took part in a "peaceful protest” Friday morning near the superintendent's office, administrators said. Officials said they were protesting the treatment of black students. According to a letter sent to OPRF families by Superintendent Joylynn Pruitt-Adams, the students gathered outside her office in the hallway at about 10 a.m., during the school's third-period classes. The students dispersed shortly after fourth period began, Pruitt-Adams said. Advertisement "[They were] holding signs protesting the treatment of black students,” Pruitt-Adams wrote. "They sat silently and peacefully against the walls of the hallway; there was no disruption or impediment for passersby.” There was no further information about what might have spurred the protest. OPRF was in the national spotlight during the fall as the series "America to Me” aired on the Starz network. The series explored issues of race, educational equity and identity. Before a Nov. 4 town hall on the series at OPRF, about 100 people gathered to demonstrate for an increase in the school's equity work. Advertisement In November, officials said racist and anti-Semetic graffiti was discovered outside the OPRF building on a shed near the tennis courts. Five days later, more "hate-speech graffiti” was discovered inside of a bathroom on campus. During a Nov. 9 assembly, officials said an image of a swastika was "air-dropped” from somewhere inside the school auditorium to student cellphones. "AirDrop” is a feature on Apple devices that allow a user to share photos with other Apple users nearby.
