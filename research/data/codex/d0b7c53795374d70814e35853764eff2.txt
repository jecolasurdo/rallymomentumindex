And, as they do day in and day out, our law enforcement personnel performed with professionalism and empathy," Strimling said. "I want to thank Chief Sauschuck and his team for their admirable work. Further, we should not underestimate the fact that while they worked toward a peaceful culmination to the protests downtown, our police and first responders continued to protect and serve the nearly 70,000 people who call Portland home. I thank all of our first responders for their service."40742574"To those who feel the pain of injustices occurring across our country, your anger is understandable," Strimling said. "Innocent lives are being lost - both civilian and sworn personnel. Orlando, Dallas, Minnesota, Louisiana - there are more. Your anger is, in many cases, justifiable. I'm angry too.""To those who are moved to protest, I urge you to do so peacefully," the mayor said. "I urge you to join the dialogue and work with the city and our police department to make sure your words are heard and not overshadowed by breaking laws meant to keep people safe. I understand and respect the right to protest. In fact, I too have engaged in protests and nonviolent civil disobedience on numerous occasions. I understand the importance of it as a tool to bring about change. But we must remember that it is when we stop shouting that we hear each other best."Organizers of the rally had been asking Sauschuck, in a prepared news release, to acknowledge "that there is a nationwide problem with the brutalization of black and brown bodies at the hands of law enforcement. We ask him to affirm that black and brown lives matter and that his department is committed to creating trusting relationships with the people of color in the neighborhoods they police."Sauschuck said that while he had heard the organizers wanted to create a dialogue with police, none of them had reached out to his department before Friday's rally."Of course their lives matter. Why wouldn't they matter?" he said Friday afternoon. "I hear a group of people that say they're angry, they're frustrated, they feel oppressed, and because of that, they want to say, 'Black lives matter too. Pay attention when these things happen in our society.' And from a law enforcement perspective, I say of course they matter.""I think that's great that you said 'Black Lives Matter,' but that is not all," organizer Mariana Angelo said about the chief's comments. "You really need to emphasize that we are being disenfranchised on a daily. We are being slain. We are only catching these on camera. These are the only ones we've caught on camera."The group is asking the police department to start a body camera program, but Sauschuck said there are no plans to start one. He said he is waiting to see how other departments handle their camera programs.Sauschuck said his department received several phone calls during the rally from Portland residents who he said wanted to show their support for police.Hundreds of people gathered July 8 in Monument Square, then marched through downtown as part of a peaceful protest against violence.Several community leaders, including Sauschuck, attended a peace gathering July 12 at the Green Memorial AME Zion Church to discuss the recent shootings of black men by white police officers.9234908Get the WMTW App PORTLAND, Maine â€” Police arrested 18 people in what turned out to be a tense Black Lives Matter protest in downtown Portland Friday night.Video: Pushing and shoving at Black Lives Matter protest Advertisement Related Content Cumberland County Sheriff's Office launches investigation on jail conduct after BLM protest arrests Black Lives Matter protesters march through Lewiston-Auburn Black Lives Matter protest organizers 'proud' to call attention to 'epidemic' Portland police chief, city manager discuss arrests Mayor Strimling reacts to Black Lives Matter arrests Volunteer describes how Black Lives Matter protest turned violent BLM Protest in Portland: Rev.
