The peaceful protest begins at 5 p.m. outside the Belmont Red Station. At 6 p.m., protesters will walk north until they reach Stewart School Lofts in Uptown. Tatyana Sampson, a 23-year-old Lakeview resident who organized the protest, stressed that the protest is intended to remain peaceful. "As a Black person, if violence erupts, we will be the first to get hurt; you are risking the safety of everyone,” Sampson said. Sampson said they organized the protest on the North Side to "hopefully wake people up” to the issues that Black people are facing. "It's a tale of two cities in Chicago,” Sampson said. "Many people up here are going about their day as if this country isn't on fire and Black people aren't fighting for their lives, and we need them to be angry and passionate like us right now.” Protesters and supporters are encouraged to donate to a number of local causes, including the Chicago Community Bond Fund and Black Lives Matter Chicago.
