The Philadelphia "Blackout” march began at 7 p.m. on 1500 Arch Street. Hundreds of protesters marched around City Hall through Dilworth Plaza and eventually stopped at the statue of former Philadelphia mayor Frank Rizzo. Raheem Harvey, one of the event organizers, told NBC10 the goal of the demonstration was to "unify the people and give them an opportunity to speak.” "As a human being we have a right to humanity,” Harvey said. "Everyone is entitled to first class citizenship regardless of the color of their skin.” U.S. & World Stories that affect your life across the U.S. and around the world.

Harvey also said the protesters specifically chose to end their demonstration at the Frank Rizzo statue based on what they believe the former Philadelphia mayor stood for. "He is an individual who was responsible for police brutality, especially towards the African American community,” Harvey said. "Here we have an individual who has his hands raised, waiving out to the people. No one thinks something is wrong with that. We definitely plan to make a statement there. We plan on working with the city to have it removed." The protesters repeatedly chanted "black lives matter," and carried a banner which read, "fight hate with love." They also held a "die-in" demonstration on the Parkway. The rally shut down several streets in Center City for a few hours. No arrests were reported however. Harvey told NBC10 the ultimate goal of the demonstrators is to spark change within the Philadelphia Police Department. "We want to be able to have a voice when it comes to the concerns of the community,” he said. "A police officer's job is to provide customer service and to also establish the law. With that in mind we need to make sure that when investigations happen within the police department, the public is fully aware. There should not be any close door investigation.” The protest was one of many that have occurred nationwide in response to two separate grand jury decisions not to indict the officers involved in the deaths of Eric Garner in New York and Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The protest also took place a day after two NYPD officers, Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu, were shot and killed by a gunman in Brooklyn during an ambush attack. The suspect in the shooting, who ultimately took his own life, posted on social media that he intended to "take 2 of theirs” prior to the incident, according to investigators. Investigators also believe the suspect shot and injured his ex-girlfriend in Baltimore before coming to New York. The fatal shooting of the two officers sparked claims from some that the nationwide protests and anti-police rhetoric inspired the shooter. In New York City, Patrolmen's Benevolent Association President Patrick Lynch also linked the killings to violence against police during recent protest demonstrations and even claimed that NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio had "blood on his hands” for his apparent lack of support for law enforcement. Harvey expressed his condolences for the NYC officers and their families while also stating the suspect in their deaths was not associated with his movement. "My heart is with the family and also my prayers,” Harvey said. "We are not against police. We are against police brutality. No one deserves to have their lives taken. It should have never happened. The person is isolated from the movement but he's using the movement to get his message across. But that's a totally isolated incident.” Members of the Philadelphia Police Civil Affairs Unit were on hand to monitor the protest.
