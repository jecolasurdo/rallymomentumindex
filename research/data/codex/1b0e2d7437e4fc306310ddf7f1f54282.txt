By T. Rees Shapiro T. Rees Shapiro Bio November 30, 2014 A demonstration against last week's Ferguson, Mo., grand jury decision snarled traffic in the District on Sunday afternoon for drivers returning from the long holiday weekend, but it ended peacefully. Witnesses said the demonstration began around noon Sunday when a group of about 30 protesters took to the streets chanting "Hands up, don't shoot” and "No justice, no peace.” Around 1 p.m some of the protesters formed a line shoulder-to-shoulder across the westbound lanes of Interstate 395 between the Maine Avenue and the Third Street tunnel exits. Police arrived on the scene shortly thereafter and stopped traffic in both directions to address the protesters. The demonstration ended peacefully, witnesses said, with police calmly taking into custody a group of protesters who laid down on the highway. Aliyyah Blake, 26, of District Heights, said that she got stuck in the traffic as a result of the demonstration. "They were in a straight line across the highway,” Blake said. "People were getting out of their cars to talk to them, but they weren't moving.” Protesters rallying against the grand jury decision in Ferguson, Mo., formed a human chain across Interstate 395 Sunday afternoon. (The Washington Post) Carrying signs that read "Black Lives Matter,” the protesters dispersed by approximately 1:30 p.m. when the last of the demonstrators on I-395 were escorted off the pavement. Ashley Burton, 28, was among the organizers who took part in a march that started at Federal Triangle and stopped at I-395. "They locked in arms in solidarity for all of the black lives that matter,” Burton said, noting that she disagreed with the St. Louis County grand jury decision not to charge police officer Darren Wilson, who is white, in the shooting death of Michael Brown, a black 18-year-old who was not armed. The grand jury decision announced last Monday stoked racial tensions in Ferguson in the wake of Brown's killing and inspired demonstrations around the world. "We shouldn't have to shut things down for people to take notice that black lives matter,” said Burton, who lives in Laurel. Rob Scott was headed from his home in Gaithersburg to enjoy an afternoon at Eastern Market and the museums on the Mall when his trip was delayed by the protest. He said he heard chants from the protesters against police brutality. "It seemed noisy, but I thought it seemed reasonably peaceful,” Scott said. District resident Gayle Thornton, 54, stood with her sister, Tamela Thornton, 51, and their niece Alexa Thornton, 13, to watch the events unfold. Gayle Thornton said that she heard commotion on the highway from her home near Seventh Street and decided to get a closer look. "This is the seat of power, and if you're going to make a statement this is the place to do it so that the country can hear it,” Gayle Thornton said. "I told my niece that people are doing this to make the world a better place for kids like you. It's important to stand up for what you believe in.” Alexa Thornton, of Boston, said that watching the protesters was a learning experience in the wake of the Ferguson decision. "They didn't sit around and watch,” Alexa Thornton said. "They did something about it.” Most Read Local 1 He's 100, a renowned jazz musician and a survivor of Tulsa's 1921 race massacre 2 An original 'Juneteenth' order found in the National Archives 3 Juneteenth celebrates 'a moment of indescribable joy': Slavery's end in Texas 4 U.S. judge to hear Trump administration's emergency request to block publication of Bolton book 5 U.S. traffic has rebounded to about 90 percent of pre-pandemic levels, analysts say Opinion Leaked document makes Trump campaign's use of Nazi-era symbol look worse Opinion We figured out when the MAGA crowd thought America was great Subscriber sign inWe noticed you're blocking ads!Keep supporting great journalism by turning off your ad blocker.
