He said protests were "overwhelmingly peaceful" and that the NYPD was "respecting the peaceful protest" after several nights of viral clashes and violent unrest.The mayor said looting seen Monday night was largely absent but that the city planned to keep a curfew in place through Monday morning.I'm at City Hall with an update. https://t.co/fyhPLO9hqS— Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) June 3, 2020 The curfew begins at 8 p.m. each night and ends at 5 a.m. each morning until the morning of June 8.De Blasio said traffic restrictions limiting vehicles below 96th Street are also likely to remain in place as well.The mayor said "we might make some adjustments along he way” but that keeping the restrictions "is the right thing to do for just a few days as we address this situation and move forward."At his daily briefing Wednesday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo also said the night had been much better compared to the previous two nights."It worked, we got results," the governor said. "Let's just remember what we did last night and keep that going."Cuomo sought to distinguish the peaceful protesters from looters and vandals, saying "two very different situations are going on."There are those who are trying to lump together the peaceful protesters & the looters. Attempting to blur the two.But we know these are two separate groups entirely. With two separate agendas.We see through this cynical attempt to discredit a legitimate protest.— Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) June 3, 2020 "One is protesting, the other is looting," the governor said. "Violence demeans the situation and loses the righteous indignation (at George Floyd's death)."Cuomo said a relatively small number of "opportunists ... see the police are busy dealing with the protesters and they say, 'Well, here's an opportunity to loot and to steal and cause mayhem.'"As for bringing in the military to quell the unrest, as President Donald Trump has suggested, Cuomo said that should only be done in dire situations, which wasn't the reality in New York City this week.The military cannot be used as a political weapon.— Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) June 3, 2020 While Tuesday night was mainly peaceful, there was looting reported at the Zara at Broadway and Vesey Street, as well as at the Nordstrom Rack near 31 Street and 6th Avenue. Damage was also seen at several locations, including a Starbucks and FedEx store, near Astor Place in the East Village.JUST IN: Zara in New York has been broken into pic.twitter.com/7MNbE3f2kn— CryptøManiac101 -- (@_Crypto_Maniac_) June 3, 2020 The Guardian Angels also faced off with looters at a Foot Locker in NoHo. Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa may have suffered a broken jaw in the standoff, which saw the Angels linking arms around the Foot Locker as looters moved in.pic.twitter.com/lKzoviojqx— Matthew Chayes (@chayesmatthew) June 3, 2020 But a show of force by the NYPD and an earlier curfew of 8 p.m. appeared to curb the widespread looting seen on Sunday and Monday nights.Thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through New York City neighborhoods on Tuesday demanding an end to police brutality. Hundreds of them faced off with the NYPD at the Manhattan Bridge.Tuesday's protests, sparked by George Floyd's death at the hands of police officers in Minneapolis, kicked off with a rally at Foley Square. Protesters soon filled streets and plazas across the city, passing sites including the Stonewall Inn, Barclays Center, Gracie Mansion, Mount Sinai Union Square — where health care workers kneeled in support — and Bryant Park. As the city's curfew went into effect at 8 p.m., many protesters were still out marching. At approximately 9:30 p.m., the NYPD said "dozens" of people had been arrested, without immediately saying when, where or why the arrests took place. See below for live updates: 11:15 p.m. Mayor Bill de Blasio says he is at Barclays Center, calling the scene there a "very calm situation.”"So far, the curfew is certainly helping, based on everything I've seen in Brooklyn and Manhattan over the last three hours,” he writes. At Barclays Center now. Very calm situation.
