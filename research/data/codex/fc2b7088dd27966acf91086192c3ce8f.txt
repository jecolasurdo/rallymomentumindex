George Floyd: Hundreds attend solidarity event in PoughkeepsieSaba Ali, Poughkeepsie Journal Published 8:04 p.m. ET May 31, 2020 | Updated 1:51 p.m. ET June 3, 2020CLOSECONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECorrection: The reporter incorrectly stated the location of Tuesday's protestHundreds gathered in the City of Poughkeepie in protest of racism and police brutality. The rally took place at Mansion Square Park and was organized in part by Black Lives Matter Hudson Valley. The event was focused on centering the leadership of black people within the black community, according to the group's Facebook page."This was about using our experiences to deepened our relationships as a community," per a post on the page."We don't need to burn buildings in order for our voices to be heard. We need to come together as a powerful unit," said Diamond Marie Mima. She brought her 12-year-old daughter with her to what organizers have called "a community circle and strategy session."During the beginning of the event, organizers had white attendees sit in a circle around people of color.

"Our police are pretty good with the community, but there was this extra sense of security from our white neighbors."Hundreds marched the streets of New Paltz on Saturday, protesting the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a police officer detained him and knelt on his neck. The protest was one of two in the mid-Hudson Valley, with another in Beacon.Mayor Rob Rolison and Police Chief Thomas Pape also attended Sunday's gathering."It wasn't a protest...it was a conversation, it was people talking about their experiences and their frustrations," said Rolison. He described the event with having close to 200 attendees and having been well organized. Rolison said he attended as a resident and because he was wearing a mask many didn't recognize him. "The reason wasn't there to be seen, it was to be present and to be part of this discussion," Rolison said, adding that the gathering brought new voices into a dialogue that he hopes will continue after the protests stop. Multiple events in the mid-Hudson Valley have been planned in protest of racism and police violence. A vigil in memory of Floyd was to be held at Changepoint Church in Poughkeepsie Sunday night. A "We Can't Breathe" protest is planned for Tuesday Harriat Tubman Park at 4 p.m.. A "Walk For Black Lives" is planned for Tuesday in Kingston, as well.
