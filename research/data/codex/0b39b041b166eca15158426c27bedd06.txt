Here are the players who protested in Week 10:Seattle Seahawks: The Seahawks linked arms and stood as a demonstration of unity during the national anthem before their game Sunday in New England. They have done so before every game this season. -- Sheil KapadiaSan Francisco 49ers: Kaepernick, safety Eric Reid and linebacker Eli Harold continued to kneel during the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Cardinals. No Niners raised their fists as they had in previous weeks. -- Nick WagonerTampa Bay Buccaneers: Wide receiver Mike Evans on Sunday became the first Bucs player to sit out the national anthem this season. He said it wasn't for the reasons Colin Kaepernick did though -- it's because Donald Trump was elected president. "I said this a long time ago," Evans said. "When he ran, I thought it was a joke." When asked if he'd continue to kneel, he said, "As long as he's the president-elect." -- Jenna LaineMiami Dolphins: Wide receiver Kenny Stills and safety Michael Thomas knelt for the anthem before the Dolphins' game against the Chargers. They've done so for every game this season. -- James WalkerSan Diego Chargers: Before Sunday's game against the Dolphins, offensive linemen Joe Barksdale, D.J. Fluker and Chris Hairston once again raised their fists during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial oppression. -- Eric D. WilliamsTennessee Titans: After the national anthem before the Titans' game against the Packers, cornerback Jason McCourty, linebacker Nate Palmer and defensive linemen Jurrell Casey and DaQuan Jones all raised a fist in the air. -- Paul KuharskyPhiladelphia Eagles: Safety Malcolm Jenkins raised a fist over his head during the national anthem before Sunday's game at the Falcons. The rest of the team joined the military in holding the large American flag spread out across the field, leaving Jenkins alone on the sideline. He has been protesting since Week 2 against the Chicago Bears. Cornerback Ron Brooks typically protests with him, but has not been present on the sideline the past three games after undergoing surgery to repair a ruptured quad tendon. Jenkins recently discussed in length his reasons for protesting. -- Tim McManusLos Angeles Rams: Defensive end Robert Quinn raised his right fist during the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Jets, as has been his custom since the start of the regular season. Quinn said he will continue to do so, regardless of whatever backlash he receives on social media. Said Quinn: "People have the right to voice their opinion. It's up to you whether you listen to it or not. If people feel bad or feel upset about making a stand, that's their personal opinion and judgment. At the end of the day, I'm just standing up for what I believe is right." -- Alden Gonzalez FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmail
