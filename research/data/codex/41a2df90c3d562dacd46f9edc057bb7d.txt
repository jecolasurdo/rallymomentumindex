Nadav Soroker Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save COLUMBIA — MU's 105th Homecoming Parade marched through downtown Saturday morning without a hitch, though there were some echoes of last year's parade-halting demonstration.Demonstrators held signs in Greek Town protesting racism on campus, while students and faculty marched in the parade wearing shirts that read "No Hate Here." Nevertheless, the atmosphere was festive as MU Interim Chancellor Hank Foley marched through campus, drawing cheers as one woman yelled "Thank you chancellor!" MU interim Chancellor Hank Foley walks through Columbia in the MU Homecoming Parade on Saturday. Foley has been interim chancellor for nearly a year, since being named in November 2015 after the resignation of then-Chancellor R. Bowen Loftin. Nadav Soroker Last year, 11 members of Concerned Student 1950 blocked then-UM System President Tim Wolfe's car and confronted him about racism on campus. That sparked weeks of unrest on campus, drew national attention and led to Wolfe's resignation. At Saturday's parade, many white attendees said they hoped this year marked a return to the parade's emphasis on traditions. Many black attendees said they welcomed the sustained attention to stamping out racism.Outside the Delta Upsilon fraternity, where black students said they were called racist slurs last month, MU students Mason and Tomas Pramod waved signs saying "Black Lives Matter" and "Racism Still Lives Here." The university and Delta Upsilon's international governing body have temporarily suspended the fraternity while they investigate the incident, and the group was barred from participating in Homecoming events."I'm glad I could make people uncomfortable today,” Tomas Pramod said. "You can walk away from the signs but we can't walk away from the color of our skin. All people can love black and gold, but we're standing up for black and brown.”One of Delta Upsilon's windows displayed a Trump campaign sign along with one that read "Make Mizzou Great Again.” As the Pramod brothers stood outside with their posters, someone inside the fraternity peeled down the Trump signs. Two members of Delta Upsilon sitting on the house steps directed a reporter to the fraternity's national spokesperson. Jill Lucht and Bill McKelvey, two MU staff members who were wearing gray "No Hate Here" T-shirts, said they wanted to show support for the students. "It seemed important, in light of what happened at (Delta Upsilon), to show solidarity with students,” McKelvey said. "Homecoming is a celebration but it's important to keep in mind that there are still issues.”As the parade passed, they joined about 50 people from the College of Human Environmental Sciences group, all sporting "No Hate Here” shirts. The college printed 1,500 shirts, and they handed out about 1,000 before the parade. "These days, when things happen it really resonates. And we have to not only say that these things are wrong, but demonstrate that," the college's Interim Dean Sandy Rikoon said in an interview on Friday. "We know we can do better," he said. As the group marched through Speakers Circle, MU student Paula Herrera led a chant of "Ashe! Power!” as she shook a Black Lives Matter sign. "The fact that Dean Rikoon did this is really impressive, considering what happened last year, with the protest,” Herrera said.Interim UM System President Mike Middleton did not attend the parade. He was at a friend's birthday party, a System spokesman said. Many students and alumni were relieved that the Homecoming Parade seemed to have returned to normal.Along the route, people cheered and clapped for passing floats as children danced and scrambled for candy. MU alumni Eric Holm, 28, and Tom Fritts, 27, have been coming to the Homecoming Parade since they were students."I definitely think changes have been made,” Fritts, who is white, said. "It seems like we're going in the right direction.”Graduate student Chelsea Page, who grew up in Columbia, said this year's parade seemed quieter than those of years past. She blamed that on the campus environment. "There seems to be more incidents that you're hearing about, which is a little unnerving — especially if you're a minority student on that campus.” Page, who is black, said. "It's not all bad, but I notice it more.”Pat Taylor, from Sikeston, Missouri, also has been returning to Columbia for the parade for years. "It doesn't matter how old you are, the atmosphere sucks you in,” she said. "What's not to love about this place?”Alumna Sarah Koci Scheilz also returns every year to watch the parade. She said she didn't witness the protest last year, but wanted to come show support for MU and see traditions she participated in as a student."To be totally honest, I think the school spirit is stronger than anything negative happening,” Scheilz said.Missourian reporter Katie Kull contributed to this article.
