LOUIS • About 300 protesters gathered briefly at Busch Stadium Monday night as the crowd inside watched the Cardinals-Cubs game, then blocked a downtown intersection to hear speeches by two mothers of young men killed by police. Barricades kept the demonstrators from getting any closer to the ballpark than 8th Street and Clark. They stood and chanted for about 10 minutes before moving downtown to effectively take over the intersection at Tucker and Market before dissipating around 9:30 p.m. There were no reports of violence.The 11th day of protests since the Sept. 15 acquittal of a white former St. Louis police officer in the shooting death of a black suspect began downtown earlier Monday. About 400 people marched to police headquarters wearing tape over their mouths to protest police silence about allegedly police violence against minorities. Demonstrators are protesting the not-guilty verdict in the bench trial of former St. Louis patrolman Jason Stockley, who had been charged with first-degree murder in the 2011 shooting death of drug suspect Anthony Lamar Smith. Stockley is white and Smith was black. The verdict sparked days of sometimes-violent protests in downtown St. Louis and other areas of the city, causing the cancellation of concerts and other events. In contrast to the chanting that had accompanied protests last week, Monday's march started with a theme of silence, with many demonstrators wearing blue tape over their mouths. Some carried signs that read, "Blue Silence is Violence." Missouri state Rep. Bruce Franks, D-St. Louis, who was among the leaders of the march, said the "blue silence" theme refers to what he claims is refusal by police to release information related to two other instances of alleged violence by officers against minorities. In addressing Monday's crowd, Franks demanded the resignation of acting Police Chief Lawrence O'Toole, whose department has faced criticism for its tactics in the past week of protests.Later Monday, several hundred demonstrators had moved to 10th and Clark, closer to the ballpark, as the Cardinals-Cubs game was in progress. Some briefly attempted to get onto Interstate 64 at the 10th street ramp but were stopped by police stationed there. Protesters then moved to Tucker and Market and listened to speakers who included Gina Torres, mother of Isaiah Hammett, who was killed earlier this year by police. Officials claim Hammett fired on them as they attempted to serve a warrant, an allegation his family disputes. Also at the rally was Bridgette Perkins, mother of Isiah Perkins, killed by police in July near Creve Coeur, after police say he ran from a stolen vehicle with a gun and attempts to use a Taser to subdue him were unsuccessful.—Joe Holleman and Kevin McDermott of the Post-Dispatch staff contributed to this report.Kevin McDermott • 314-340-8268@kevinmcdermott on Twitterkmcdermott@post-dispatch.com 0 comments Tags Jason Stockley Anthony Lamar Smith Be the first to know Get local news delivered to your inbox!
