Image: @HannahLive5 By Megan Specia2015-06-18 17:13:43 UTC Charleston is in mourning after a gunman stormed the historic black Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, killing nine people. Hundreds on Thursday afternoon packed into Morris Brown A.M.E. Church, which is just blocks away from "Mother Emanuel," for an emotional prayer vigil. The church quickly reached capacity, and a large crowd gathered just outside its doors.

Its congregation is the oldest of its kind in the South. But local reporters described a diverse crowd gathered in the wooden pews and balconies of Morris Brown A.M.E. church, belting out hymns and mourning the victims of the attack.

What happened today in this church — those are the people of South Carolina," Haley said. Choking back tears, Haley spoke to the congregation and vowed that the "day would come" for suspected shooter Dylann Roof, who was taken into custody on Thursday. "There only had to have been hate in his heart," she added. As the church reached capacity, mourners poured out onto the street. Many held hands, prayed, and sang as they remembered those killed. At one point, they formed a circle and sang "We Shall Overcome" and "Amazing Grace."

As the crowd applauded calls for gun control, Republicans Governor Haley, Sen. Tim Scott, and Attorney General Alan Wilson remained seated. Political awkward moment: Gov. Haley, Sen.

"At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn't happen in other places with this kind of frequency," said Obama during his speech. He noted the historic importance of the Emanuel A.M.E. Church, known locally as "Mother Emanuel." He personally knew the pastor of the church, South Carolina Senator Clementa Pinckney, and his family. "Mother Emanuel Church and its congregation have risen before from flames from an earthquake from other dark times,” said Obama. "It will rise again now as a place of peace."
