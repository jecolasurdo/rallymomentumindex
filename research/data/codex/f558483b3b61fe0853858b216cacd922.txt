Joseph Rodriguez/News & Record Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save GREENSBORO — Protesters took over the City Council chamber during a meeting Tuesday night, singing, chanting and sitting in council members' chairs for 30 minutes before the building was evacuated and closed by police."We have occupied this space,” said one protester, attempting to continue the meeting after council members called an abrupt recess and left the room. "This is our space now.”Dozens of activists showed up to the meeting to urge the council to intervene in a pending court case involving an alleged altercation between a minor and a police officer last summer. Jose Charles was 15 when he was arrested during the city's Fun Fourth Festival at Center City Park. Charles was charged with malicious assault on an officer, disorderly conduct, simple affray and resisting arrest. He is accused of spitting blood on an officer's face.His mother, Tamara Figueroa, backed by members of several community organizations, contends that Charles was attacked by a group of kids, then grabbed by an officer in an alley near Friendly Avenue. He spit blood because he was coughing and couldn't breathe, she said.Residents have attended city meetings for months, begging council members to watch footage of the incident taken from the police officer's body-worn camera. Council members voted 5-4 in March to view the video, but said they would do so only after the conclusion of an internal review of what happened.An initial, internal review by the Greensboro Police Department ruled that officers did nothing wrong during the arrest, but the Police Community Review Board, composed of residents, disagreed with the police department's decision and asked that Chief Wayne Scott review the video. Scott ruled in favor of the police department, forwarding the matter to City Manager Jim Westmoreland.Westmoreland ruled on the matter last week, nearly two months after council first voted to view the footage. His findings were detailed in a report that has not been made public, but Figueroa indicated Monday that he sided with the police department.A Superior Court judge ruled last month that the council could view the footage in closed session, but the ruling prohibited members from commenting publicly on its contents. Council members adhered to the gag order Tuesday, convening their regular meeting after more than five hours of closed session without conveying any details about what they had seen.At the beginning of the meeting, Mayor Nancy Vaughan moved to rearrange the night's agenda to leave ample time at the end for comments about the case. Twenty-three people had signed up to speak on the matter, she said.But chaos reigned almost instantly. In lieu of commenting, the second speaker played a video clip of a friend dressed in a police uniform, (Information has been corrected to fix an error. See correction at end of story. 8:45 a.m., 5/3/17) thanking City Council for allowing "corruption and white supremacy” to persist in the Greensboro Police Department by refusing to intervene in the case.Audience members, many of them holding hot-pink signs emblazoned with messages of support for Jose, hooted, hollered and stomped their feet after his presentation, prompting a warning from Vaughan."Excuse me,” she said. "I hope that we will have respect for the people who signed up so we can allow them the opportunity to speak, but if we have outbursts like this, we are going to have to clear the chambers.”After hearing comments from two more speakers, Councilwoman Sharon Hightower asked City Attorney Tom Carruthers if she could legally make a motion to advise the chief of police to ask the district attorney to drop the charges against Jose.Doing so was legal, Carruthers said, but could threaten the separation of government powers. At that, several audience members began shouting.Among them was Irving Allen, head of the Gate City chapter of Black Lives Matter. After several comments, Vaughan asked him to stop speaking from his seat. When he refused, she asked security to remove him.Dozens of activists leapt to Allen's defense, hoisting their signs in the air and yelling, "Don't touch him” at police officers. More people began shouting, then singing, then chanting. Amid the chaos, council members called for recess and exited the room, leaving police officers in an uneasy standoff with protesters, who moved to the dais and eventually took over the chairs reserved for city administrators and council members.After about 30 minutes, police officers told the crowd the building was being closed. They could evacuate or stay and be arrested for second-degree trespassing."On whose authority?” Allen demanded. "I thought this was the people's house.”And then Charles's mother spoke. Standing near the podium with her son, she told the crowd she did not want anyone to get hurt."Don't do resistance, please,” she said. "Please.”After that, and with pressure from police officers, protesters left the room and filed outside. They chanted along with a drumline in the governmental plaza for several minutes before marching toward downtown, where eight people were ultimately arrested for impeding the flow of traffic by sitting cross-legged on Friendly Street.All eight were charged with misdemeanors and released on written promises to appear, police said.Council members eventually reconvened the meeting, allowing media back into the building before they adjourned.Most left quickly or declined to comment, citing the Superior Court gag order. Much of that caution is because the case involves a minor, Vaughan said."But I will say that many persons who have not seen the video think they know the facts,” she said. "We have seen the video and I'm aware of what is shown and what is not shown.”Hightower, who'd requested details from the city attorney just before the meeting devolved into chaos, said she understood the frustration from community members."The review process took too long, which just inflamed the process,” she said. "I get it. I really do get it. I wish they would understand that a lot of us up there get it, too.”Council will reconvene in closed session at 2:30 p.m. today for further viewing of the body-camera footage. Members are still prohibited from discussing the video in public, but it's unlikely the city will intervene in the court case (anything the council could do would be "largely symbolic,” Hightower said). And the matter is unlikely to come before the council in any official capacity again.Still, community members declared the meeting a victory. The protest was necessary to call attention to the lack of action from the city, said the Rev. Nelson Johnson, pastor of Faith Community Church and a long-time civil-rights activist."They have authority as elected officials and they chose not to use that authority,” he said. "The only reason we were out there is because the council will not do its job.”Correction: Story initially stated that the second speaker showed a video of himself dressed in a police uniform.
