Motorcyclists Take Part In Unity Ride To La Mesa As Weekend Protests Continue — 2:05 p.m., Sunday, June 14, 2020 A weekend of peaceful protests in support of racial equality continued today with bikers in La Mesa and babies and their moms in Coronado, among other gatherings planned for later in the afternoon. About 150 motorcyclists participated in a unity ride from Oak Park to police headquarters in La Mesa at 1 p.m. to join up with another group of protesters gathering to demonstrate against racism and police brutality. The demonstration was billed as a non-violent call for change in law enforcement and official accountability for several widely condemned police encounters that played out recently in the eastern San Diego County city. "We are Peaceful!," organizer Tasha Williamson posted on Twitter. "We are Unified! We Want JUSTICE!" The leader of the biker contingent, who goes by the name "Caveman," said he wants police to engage in some introspection about how officers treat people of color.

"And it's unfortunate that it has come to our community. They need to stand back and maybe look at themselves." La Mesa Police Chief Walter Vasquez responded to that message with gratitude and a message of his own. "Thank you -- but we need their input," Vasquez said. "And then change needs to occur, especially from the police department. We all need to get better." At 10 a.m. in Coronado, more than 100 people turned out at Spreckles Park for a "Baby's First Black Lives Matter Protest" organized by Ellie Coburn and featuring activism storytime, music, dancing and voices of black motherhood. "We had a beautiful turnout," Coburn told City News Service. "We had the opportunity to listen to some incredible mama speakers speak on black motherhood and the founder of SD Peaceful Protests speak on the importance of early race awareness." She said participants heard the reading of a storybook on activism, danced and sang to empowerment music by black artists, taught the kids how to do protest chants and engage in about an hour of "art, bubbles and community." "This event for families with young children is so important because we know that children establish a lifetime of racial biases by just five years old," Coburn said. The event lasted about 90 minutes. The group is planning another event on June 28 in North County. At noon in Pacific Beach, "Walk for Equality" protesters met at the Crystal Pier to begin a march. At 2 p.m., a Black Lives Matter march was scheduled to begin at the San Diego Zoo and end up at the San Diego Police Department headquarters at 1401 Broadway. — KPBS Reporter Amita Sharma and City News Service Bikers Take Part In Unity Ride To La Mesa As Weekend Protests Continue — 8:55 a.m., Sunday, June 14, 2020 A protest against police use of excessive force against people of color is set to take place Sunday afternoon in La Mesa, where the same sort of demonstration two weekends ago spun out of control into destructive anarchy. The planned downtown demonstration is intended to be a non-violent call for change in law enforcement and official accountability for several widely condemned police encounters that played out recently in the eastern San Diego County city. "We are Peaceful!," organizer Tasha Williamson posted on Twitter. "We are Unified! We Want JUSTICE!" Among the demands that will be voiced by participants during the rally at La Mesa police headquarters, according to planners, will be the firing of two LMPD officers — one involved in the allegedly abusive May 27 arrest of a young man near Grossmont Transit Center, the other in the serious injuring by a police projectile of a 59-year-old woman taking part in the raucous protest three days later. That demonstration began in an orderly fashion but devolved into burglary, looting and arson fires that destroyed several commercial buildings, including two banks. La Mesa police were "making every effort to reach out to the event organizer for further information to ensure we have appropriate resources on hand to facilitate a safe and peaceful exercise of the group's First Amendment rights," LMPD spokesman Lt. Greg Runge told the Times of San Diego on Thursday. — City News Service San Diegans Turn Out For Boat Parade Honoring Trump's Re-Election 8:40 a.m., Sunday, June 14, 2020 Thousands of people lined San Diego Bay Saturday to watch a Trump Boat Parade as hundreds of boats traveled through the waters from Point Loma to Coronado. Parade participants carried posters and waved U.S. flags in support of President Donald Trump's re-wlection bid and to celebrate the president's 74th birthday Sunday. The parade was organized by Nick Garcia, founder and CEO of Nitro Gun Co. in Carlsbad, which manufactures spearguns used in fishing. At one point, a group of planes flew in formation over the parade. At another point, a plane flew over the boats carrying a banner that read "DUMP TRUMP #BUNKERBOY." Garcia, in an appearance on local TV Saturday morning, said the parade was not meant to divide people, rather he wanted all of San Diego to unite and support the United States of America. — City News Service Photo by Andi Dukleth Protesters gather at the One American News Network (OAN) headquarters in San Diego on June 13, 2020. Protesters Demonstrate At One America Network Headquarters — 5:15 p.m., Saturday, June 13, 2020 Protesters stood outside the One America News Network headquarters on Morena Boulevard today to demonstrate against the conservative news station for what they say are lies. At one point, OAN CEO and founder Robert Herring Sr. stepped outside the office to show protesters a sign that read "Thank you. You handled it well." Photo by Andi Dukleth One American News Network (OANN) CEO Robert Herring holds a sign for protesters gathered outside the OANN headquarters in San Diego, California on June 13, 2020. The sign reads "Thank you. You handled it well." Earlier, protesters say Herring argued with them, saying he asked them for "proof." The network had hired armed guards to protect employees during the protest. — City News Service Anti-Racism Protesters Peacefully March In San Diego — 3:45 p.m., Saturday, June 13, 2020 Protesters held peaceful gatherings and marches Saturday through the streets of Coronado, downtown San Diego and in Pacific Beach. At least 300 students and parents from Coronado Unified School District gathered in Spreckles Park to speak about the issue of racism, according to protest organizer and parent Anne Edwardson. The group then marched through the streets of Coronado for about an hour. Edwardson said she's been battling school board members for years to get them to do something about minority students being treated badly by teachers and other students. She said it's going to take a lot of pressure on the school administration to get them to listen to complaints about racism on campuses. "We've been brushed off for so long," Edwardson said, noting that the group planned to prepare online comments to present to the school board at their next meeting on Thursday. In downtown San Diego, the Party for Socialism and Liberation - San Diego and other activist groups hosted a "March & Rally: Defund the Police. Fund the People" that began at noon in front of the San Diego County Administration Center along the San Diego Bay waterfront and marched in the street down North Harbor Drive. Also at noon, a youth-led protest was held in Pantoja Park in downtown San Diego. A Black Lives Matter protest began at 2 p.m. in Pacific Beach Community Park and protesters marched to Bonita Cove at West Mission Bay Drive. Of the gatherings and marches in San Diego, SDPD Officer Tony Martinez said, "There were no disturbances. Everything's been peaceful so far." — City News Service More Anti-Racism Protests Planned For San Diego — 12:15 p.m., Saturday, June 13, 2020 Several protests will be held Saturday in San Diego County to demonstrate against racism and inequality in the justice system. Students and parents of the Coronado Unified School District were set to lead a march at 11 a.m. to bring attention to "a pervasive racism in the district," said organizer Anne Edwardson. The group will meet at Spreckels Park, 601 Orange Ave., and march to the superintendent's office. Students and parents "have unified in recent days due to the lack of response from the school district to their repeated requests for change," Edwardson said. The Party for Socialism and Liberation - San Diego and other activist groups at noon will host "March & Rally: Defund the Police. Fund the People!" in downtown San Diego at Waterfront Park, 1600 Pacific Highway. Also at noon, a youth-led protest will be held in Pantoja Park, West G St. in downtown San Diego. A Black Lives Matter protest will begin at 2 p.m. in Pacific Beach Community Park, 1405 Diamond St., and protesters will march to Bonita Cove, 1100 West Mission Bay Drive. — City News Service San Diego NAACP Leader Calls De-escalation Plan 'Utterly Inadequate' — 11:15 a.m., Saturday, June 13, 2020 The president of the NAACP San Diego Branch Saturday criticized the proposal to de-escalate confrontational law enforcement situations adopted Wednesday by the San Diego County Police Chiefs and Sheriff's Association. The plan calls on all police personnel to "use tactics and techniques to persuade" suspects to "voluntarily comply" and mitigate the need to use increased physical tactics to resolve situations safely, the association said. RELATED: San Diego Regional Law Enforcement Agency Adopts De-Escalation Protocol Francine Maxwell, NAACP San Diego Branch president, issued a statement in reaction to the proposal: "We find this document to be profoundly tone-deaf and utterly inadequate. This document seems to have been prepared inside an echo chamber of highly paid law enforcement officials. Where was the input from the taxpaying public?" The policies unanimously adopted by the group are the culmination of a project that began last June with the creation of a committee tasked with exploring the hot-button issue. The committee included representatives from all countywide municipal police agencies, the San Diego County District Attorney's Office and a local psychiatric emergency-response team. Guiding the development of the new policy was "the overarching principle of reverence for human life in all investigative, enforcement and other interactions between law enforcement and members of the community," according to the association. But Maxwell responded to the proposal by asking, "Where in this document is it affirmed that the purpose of law enforcement is to protect and to serve, not to dominate and control? Where in this document are the policies and procedures needed to reign in the abuse, violence, and death that so regularly occur in citizen interactions with law enforcement?" Maxwell asked the law enforcement group to apologize for and withdraw the proposal, which she argued "does nothing to restore the public's trust and faith." She made a few other recommendations as well, including asking law enforcement to sit down with individuals who have suffered trauma and abuse, and she asked that officials move swiftly to build a new spirit of service and protection into their departments. She said officers who will not change should be removed, "rather than allow them to corrupt another generation of recruits with their aggression and violence." According to the association's strategy, peace officers should consider these concepts: Pre-engagements which involve "the process of gathering and assessing information prior to deploying the available personnel, tactics, equipment and other appropriate and obtainable resources" so as to "enhance the probability of a peaceful outcome." De-escalation, which hinges on the use of techniques intended "to gain voluntary compliance from an individual in order to gain or maintain control of an incident while reducing the need for physical coercion." Disengagement, or "tactical withdraw," an enforcement method that can "be a viable option for individuals in crisis who pose no additional threats to others, or resistant offenders who may later be apprehended under safer conditions." The mission of the project "was to not only define best practices for de-escalation, but to do so collectively to ensure the county is of one mind on the philosophy," said Chula Vista Police Chief Roxana Kennedy, president of the police leadership body. "As part of this community, we understand the importance of violence prevention whenever possible, and de-escalation techniques are the best way to get there." The association included the law enforcement leadership of the county and all local cities, as well as San Diego Harbor Police, the county Probation Department and the police departments of the San Diego Community College District, San Diego State University, San Diego Unified School District and the University of California San Diego. — City News Service Armed Guards to Protect OAN Headquarters During Protest – 9:30 a.m., Saturday, June 13, 2020 San Diego-based One America News Network has hired armed guards to protect employees during a scheduled protest against the network Saturday. "There will be an increased security presence onsite," news director Chris Schickedanz wrote in a staff memo Friday obtained by Times of San Diego. "The police are aware of the situation and are monitoring," the memo added. "The gate will be locked and employee badges will be required for entry. There will be no entry or exit between the hours of 11a & 4p." Schickedanz didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. But late Friday, CEO and founder Robert Herring Sr. confirmed via email: "We do have armed guards, but I don't think telling everyone who, when and where would be very smart." He said OANN was working with the San Diego Police Department "and have great respect for them. We have no fear as you know we are well taken care of." As for critics of the conservative media outlet — which is more favorable in its coverage of President Donald Trump than most other networks — he said: "I wish they would watch news and educate themselves on what is going on." On Tuesday, Rep. Scott Peters called on OANN to issue a public apology and retraction of a story about the injury of a 75-year-old man by police in Buffalo, New York. John Brunelle of La Mesa is one of the organizers of Saturday's protest. He said he was made aware of the staff email earlier Friday. "I'm honestly not too concerned with it," he said. "Our plan is to have a peaceful protest that draws attention to the fact that OANN is based out of San Diego and does not represent the values of our community. We have absolutely no intention of causing any disturbances or problems for anybody present at the facility on Saturday." A 40-year-old stagehand and video specialist with IATSE Local 122, Brunelle said he wasn't certain how many people would turn out for the protest — one of several planned in San Diego on various issues. "I was honestly hoping for a small but passionate group, but it seems that things may have gained a bit of momentum," he said via text. "If I had to guess, I would say maybe around 100 participants should show up." Krystin Cline, 28, another protest organizer, said the decision to bring in armed guards was "just as inappropriate as having militarized police." Also a La Mesan and IATSE Local 122 stagehand, she added: "It's better to try to inspire change and respect than to go directly to fear and intimidation." The 160-word employee memo went on to say: "You need to be here, or gone for the day, by 11 (a.m.) -- or be willing to wait until 4 (p.m.) This is being done to ensure no one is able to get into the facility with the gate opening and closing during the planned rally time." The protest was promoted on social media, including a Facebook event page. — Ken Stone, City News Service San Diego Catholic Bishop And Other Faith Leaders Call For Law Enforcement Reform, End Of Police Brutality – 10:00 a.m., Thursday, June 11, 2020 San Diego Catholic Bishop Robert McElroy will join about 20 other faith leaders from around San Diego County to call for an end to police brutality and for law enforcement reforms.

The mayor said the department has been developing the new policy since last week based on feedback received at hearings held by the city's Citizens Advisory Board on Police/Community Relations, Community Review Board on Police Practices, and Human Relations Commission. WATCH LIVE here: Faulconer said such a policy was important to "give officers clear rules of the road on how to safely control a situation and resolve it with lower levels of force." Without disclosing specifics of what the policy would entail, Faulconer said it would go into effect "immediately" once completed, and that he and SDPD Chief David Nisleit would unveil details next week. — City News Service Grandmother Shot By Projectile During Protest In La Mesa Speaks – 03:15 p.m., June 10, 2020 A San Diego woman who was shot in the head by a bean bag round from a La Mesa police officer during a protest last month spoke Wednesday for the first time publicly since the incident. "I'm a productive member of society. I go to San Diego City College — I was ... that's changed — working in the bachelor's degree in the social service program. I'm also in recovery,” Leslie Furcron, 59, said in a frail voice. "I'm a productive member of society. I'm a law-abiding citizen.

Zachary Alexander Karas, 28, is charged with possession of an unregistered destructive device for allegedly having two glass bottles containing gasoline and wicks while at the protest, which began May 30 and carried over into the morning of May 31. According to the charging document, officers spotted Karas and his girlfriend sitting on the pavement at the corner of Allison Avenue and Spring Street at around 2 a.m. May 31. Karas was arrested for not leaving the area after dispersal orders were given by law enforcement, following the declaration of an unlawful assembly, according to the complaint. In an interview with law enforcement, Karas allegedly said "he brought the Molotov cocktails to the protest at the police station because he intended to use the Molotov cocktails to set fires, but ultimately did not cause any fires." Fires were set at the Chase and Union Bank branches and Randall Lamb Associates building near the site of the protest, but the complaint does not allege Karas set any of the fires sparked following the protest. "The Constitution strongly protects the First Amendment right of all to speak out and peacefully protest," said U.S. Attorney Robert Brewer. "My office is committed to protecting that First Amendment right. "Violence, however, by a relatively small number of opportunists who sought to wreak havoc, destroy property, and threaten the safety of peaceful protesters will not be tolerated." —City News Service Woman Shot In Head With Bean Bag Round At La Mesa Protest Released From Hospital – 3:30 p.m., June 9, 2020 A La Mesa woman who was shot in the head by a law enforcement projectile during a police protest last month was released from the hospital Tuesday. Leslie Furcron, 59, was hospitalized in an intensive-care unit in a medically induced coma after she was struck in the forehead with a bean bag round on the night of May 30. Cellphone video and photographs that went viral show Furcron lying on the ground, blood streaming down her face, amid shouting demonstrators attending the protest against police brutality. Furcron's family, as well as their attorney Dante Pride, have called for the officer involved to be fired and criminally charged. La Mesa Police Chief Walt Vasquez said last week that the incident remains under investigation. — City News Service San Diego City Council Hears From Public Regarding Police Department Budget – 4:50 p.m., June 8, 2020 Following another weekend of largely peaceful protests against police brutality, the San Diego City Council heard public comments Monday — both written and telephoned in — from hundreds of residents urging the council to reject a proposed $27 million increase in the budget for the San Diego Police Department. The majority of callers asked for the police to be defunded, with funds going toward marginalized and vulnerable communities instead. Speakers asked for the money to be used for homeless outreach, mental health services, racial equity commissions and rent-assistance programs, among myriad other ideas. WATCH here: Councilwoman Monica Montgomery said she will propose an Office on Race and Equity to address some of the concerns the citizens voiced with policing. "As elected officials, we must honestly and genuinely address the root causes of the local protests — the inequity in enforcement and the systemic racism that is prevalent in our region," she said. "From the beginning of my administration, I have championed a holistic approach to reform measures, including economic justice components. This new Office on Race and Equity is another step in the right direction, along with other reform measures." For several hours, the number of callers waiting to speak to the council exceeded the phone line's capacity, with many having to wait before they could even call in to wait in a queue to speak. At 1 p.m., the city's phone system crashed and the council took a break to get it running again. – City News Service Attorneys Lead Protest Against Police Brutality, Racism In Downtown San Diego – 1:38 p.m., Monday, June 8, 2020 A group of attorneys and staff from Federal Defenders of San Diego, Inc., led a march downtown Monday afternoon to protest against police brutality and systemic racism.

"We're here to show support for the movement because I feel like all my black friends,” said Jodi, a local resident who attended with her 9- and 7-year-old. "In the past all of the black community fought for civil rights, and those are my rights too and so they need us," Two demonstrations took place in Santee. The first one — which kicked off with the Cupid Shuffle dance near West Hills Park — was organized by Santee residents Tasha Cassidy and Alana Ethridge, both 23. They said they arranged the march "to spread love, peace and to say black lives matter." They also added that they want to counter the stereotype of Santee. "There's a stigma of Santee being racist,” said Ethridge, an African American. "We want unity and diversity in our town. We grew up here. And that's not going to happen if people say Santee is a racist town.” A second protest followed, with a bigger group of people marching to the Santee sheriff's department.

The group left flowers at the sheriff's station and honored George Floyd with nine minutes of silence, which is how long a Minneapolis officer held his knee on Floyd's neck. The protesters then marched back to their starting point. Later, sheriff's deputies raced to a Target store along the group's route where the demonstrators had encountered an opposing group. All eventually left and no arrests were made. Joining Sunday's protests was the San Diego Street Medic Collective, which provided first aid, snacks and water to the demonstration. – KPBS Staff Sunday Evening Protest Briefly Shuts Down University Avenue In Hillcrest – 9:45 p.m., June 7, 2020 In Hillcrest, a protest march began around 7:45 p.m. near University Avenue and Richmond Street, near a McDonald's restaurant.

Shortly before noon, the San Diego Police Department tweeted that a large group of peaceful protestors had begun to march onto Ash Street, with plans to head north on 6th toward Hillcrest. The department also tweeted that it would be closing streets to allow the march to continue. Police are also monitoring a protest caravan. It was planned for noon at the Torrey Pines Gliderport, according to organizers. The gathering is a "moving protest" put on by Black Lives Matter, with plans to head to La Jolla, Las Colinas Detention Center, El Cajon, Hillcrest, National City, and ending in San Diego. Also at noon at Civic Center Park in Vista, a protest called "100 Mothers March for Criminal Justice Reform" was expected to include mothers from across Southern California. Organizations participating include Mothers Against Police Brutality; Mothers Against Racism in America; and Mothers Against Criminal Injustices. Earlier Saturday at Tourmaline Beach, hundreds of surfers gathered on the shore and in the water to "Paddle for Peace." The event's flyer said, "It is important that we lead with kindness and come together as a community full of love and support." In Chula Vista, police officials said they are aware of a planned peace rally in the Memorial Park area. The organizers plan to remain in the park while they play music and worship. — CNS and KPBS Staff Protests Begin At Three Locations Around San Diego County –11:45 a.m., June 6, 2020 San Diego police were observing protesters at three locations around the county Saturday, while Supervisor Nathan Fletcher called for the removal of all National Guard troops from the county. At 10:45 a.m., the San Diego Police Department tweeted, "Protests are occurring and we are at each one ensuring a safe environment." The police department said about 3,000 people were at the County Administration Center, about 100 people were at a protest on Texas Street and Adams Avenue, and a Del Mar Heights event had a crowd of about 300. "Our roadways will be busy all day so everyone, please be extra careful," the police department said. Meanwhile, Fletcher called for the removal of the National Guard from San Diego. Fletcher tweeted, "We need to focus on efforts around authentic dialogue, uplifting the voices of the peaceful protestors and driving substantive change to address the problem of systemic racism. These protests are peaceful and the presence of the National Guard only escalates the situation. "While there are times, particularly those around responding to natural disasters or humanitarian need, when the National Guard might be appropriate, this is not one of them," he continued. Outside the County Administration Building, protesters gathered Saturday for a demonstration against racism and police brutality as National Guard troops and San Diego police stood near the building. At 10 a.m., protesters observed eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence in memory of George Floyd, the 46-year-old black man who died in Minneapolis on Memorial Day after a white officer pressed his knee to his neck for more than eight minutes. The four officers who handled the arrest were all fired and later charged with crimes. Derek Chauvin, the officer with his knee on Floyd's neck, has been charged with second-degree murder. J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. Critics have spotlighted Floyd's death as an illustration of wider law enforcement abuses. At about 10:17 a.m., the police said the large group of 3,000 peaceful protesters began to march onto Ash Street. "They will be going north on Sixth Avenue towards Hillcrest," police said. "We will be temporarily closing numerous streets to allow the march to continue." More demonstrations are expected in Chula Vista, Vista and Santee over the weekend. On Saturday, San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore tweeted, "All of Friday's demonstrations in sheriff's department jurisdictions were peaceful. We will always support the public's right to free speech and assembly. We encourage the peaceful gathering of people. We respect your right to be heard. Thank you."—City News Service Anti-Police-Brutality Protests Continue Across San Diego Area Friday Night – 8:45 a.m., June 6, 2020 Groups of demonstrators hit the streets in the San Diego area for another day Friday, marching, chanting and holding protest signs aloft to honor the memory of George Floyd and to demand racial equity and an end to excessive force in the nation's policing.

Gavin Newsom has ordered the state police training program to stop teaching officers how to use a hold that can block the flow of blood to the brain. Newsom, a Democrat, took the action after two weeks of protests across the country prompted by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Floyd died on Memorial Day after a police officer put his knee on his neck for several minutes. Since then, some police departments have moved to end the use of carotid holds that stop or slow the flow of blood to the brain. Newsom said that hold has no place in the 21st Century.

The "8 Can't Wait" program, created by anti-police-brutality agency Campaign Zero, has gained national attention from Los Angeles to New York for its simple, customizable message. According to the organization, the institutional changes list can decrease police violence by 72%. The policies are: — banning chokeholds; — requiring de-escalation tactics; — requiring warning before shooting; — exhausting all other means before shooting; — requiring other officers to intervene in the event of excessive force; — banning shooting at vehicles; — requiring use of "force continuum," or a reasonable amount of force for a situation; and — requiring comprehensive reporting on use-of-force incidents. According to officials in the coastal city, the Carlsbad Police Department already had many of the policies, or similar ones in place and employs officers with special expertise in preventing violence during interactions with crime suspects and other members of the public. — City News Service Thousands Protest In Hillcrest, North Park On George Floyd's Memorial Service – 9:40 p.m., June 4, 2020 An estimated 2,000 people took to the streets Thursday evening — the day of George Floyd's memorial service — to protest against police brutality and racial injustice.

Then, protesters turned around and headed back toward downtown. Rashanna Lee, 23, is one of the organizers supporting youth who started the demonstration. "I'm here because of course I support the end of police brutality. I support defunding the police," said Lee. "And I think defunding the police is a fundamental step to re-enriching the communities because we can redirect those funds in San Diego." The protest was peaceful and largely led by young people.

Organizers called on the crowd to end the protest peacefully and disperse. San Diego Police Department Sergeant Cory Mapston told KPBS Thursday night that "it's been generally peaceful,” and that there "haven't been any mass arrests or significant incidents.” Protest Held in Chula Vista, Another Planned Outside SDPD Headquarters; Authorities Monitoring 'Gun Squad' In Carlsbad – 4 p.m., June 4, 2020 A group of protesters gathered outside Chula Vista Community Park Thursday afternoon, one of several demonstrations planned Thursday throughout the county to honor George Floyd. The Black Lives Matter protest started around 2 p.m., and was slated to include a march around the Eastlake community, according to a flier posted on social media. A group of uniformed officers was seen kneeling with the protesters at one point during the afternoon event. In North County, a demonstration was planned in Oceanside near City Hall, while in San Diego, a youth-led group planned to gather at 5 p.m. outside San Diego police headquarters at 1401 Broadway, then march toward North Park and back. Fliers promoting that protest state a list of demands from the group, which include banning the use of "military grade weapons on unarmed protesters," firing the La Mesa police officer who arrested 23-year-old Amaurie Johnson near the Grossmont Trolley station last week, and reforming police practices to prevent the deaths of detainees and other citizens. The San Diego protest is being led by "a group of black youths in San Diego," according to the flier, which reads, "Please come at your own risk, as demonstrated at previous protests, the police are not afraid to engage in hostile tactics, but please come only if you are planning to participate in peaceful congregation and protests. The organizers do not condone looting, fighting or setting fires. Bring signs, wear a mask and come prepared." * In Carlsbad, an investigation was underway into a social media posting in which a young man claims to be putting together a "gun squad" to attack anyone taking part in "looting and anarchy" during police brutality protests in that city. "Come with guns," the unidentified man says in the video while pacing around shirtless, apparently in a bedroom or home office. "Come with Mace. Come with batons — whatever the (expletive) you got. Anyone who tries to break into a store, watch them (expletive) suffer. Let's (expletive) go!" Late Thursday morning, the Carlsbad Police Department announced that it was looking into the online posting. "Thank you to all who have reported to us (the) video and messaging encouraging violence toward protestors," the agency stated on Twitter. "We are actively investigating. We take all threats of violence seriously and violence of any sort will not be tolerated." The man in the video, claiming that a three-day demonstration is scheduled to begin in Carlsbad this weekend and is "probably gonna turn into a riot," boasts that he has coordinated with police in his supposed plan to protect the coastal city and that "veterans" have agreed to join in the planned crackdown. "Got some good news," he says. "Anyone who's down, who (wants) to join this gun squad ... (for) protecting the city, let me know." A text statement that precedes the video reads, in part: "If I see looting and anarchy I will pull triggers. Terrorists are now outnumbering police." — City News Service SD Sheriff Justifies Calling National Guard; County GOP Issues Support Of Law Enforcement – 12:35 p.m., June 4, 2020 Photo by Steve Walsh Members of the California National Guard are among the uniformed presence in front of the La Mesa Police station, June 4, 2020. San Diego County Sheriff Bill Gore on Thursday defended his decision to call in the National Guard. In a statement, he said while his department respects people's right to protest, the guards were called to prepare for any demonstrations that may escalate into riots. "We saw this happen in La Mesa (last) Saturday ... when several businesses were looted and damaged, including two banks, which burned to the ground. La Mesa City Hall also sustained fire damage as rioters broke in and tried to burn it down,” he said in a statement. Gore said deputies were not prepared and did not have enough resources to stop the looting and vandalism in La Mesa last Saturday and he won't "let that happen again.” Also on Thursday, The Republican Party of San Diego issued a statement in support of law enforcement, who stands "between a civilized society and chaos every day.” Party chairman Tony Krvaric said the men and women in blue put their lives on the line every day to keep "law abiding citizens safe.” "Though America isn't perfect — no country is — the pursuit for a more perfect union depends on all of us operating within the basic norms of civilized society,” Krvaric said in a statement. "Those who choose to operate outside of those norms must be dealt with swiftly and brought to justice — or chaos will ensue." 15 Law Enforcement Agencies Throughout County Announce End To Carotid Restraint – 8 a.m., June 4, 2020 Fifteen San Diego-area law enforcement agencies have announced that they will halt their use of the so-called carotid restraint, a compliance technique that renders uncooperative detainees unconscious but can prove deadly if performed improperly. Those agencies include: police departments in Carlsbad, Chula Vista, Coronado, El Cajon, Escondido, La Mesa, National City, Oceanside and San Diego, as well as the San Diego County Sheriff's Department and San Diego Harbor Police. Police departments at San Diego State University and University of California San Diego also announced an end to the use of the carotid restraint, along with the San Diego Community College Police Department and the San Diego Unified School District Police Department.

Faith Leaders Hold Vigil In Southeast San Diego – 8 p.m., June 3, 2020 Photo by Evan Yamada/@e_yamada Ismahan Abdullahi, the executive director of the Muslim-American Society, speaks to the crowd during during a prayer vigil on Wednesday, June 3, 2020. Local clergy and faith leaders joined San Diego City Council Member Monica Montgomery Wednesday for a prayer vigil at sunset on the Martin Luther King Jr. Promenade. They called for reflection, public expressions of love and that protesters across the globe achieve their goal of fundamentally changing policing in America. They said the country is once again at a breaking point, where people of faith must come together to push the nation on a path towards justice. "I [had to] to tell my 5-year-old son that 'Son, we're in critical times, times where people don't really love like Jesus teaches us to love,'” Nate Stewart, the lead pastor at Greater Life Church in southeast San Diego, told the crowd of about 100 people. "As one of many great faith leaders, we stand in this community for change, and for justice for all.” Ismahan Abdullahi, the executive director of the Muslim-American Society, said she believes that it's racism that helps keep people divided, while faith can bring them together. "As a Muslim woman, as an individual who has been impacted by Islamaphobia, as a refugee who has been impacted by xenophobia, let me tell you when folks see me, they see the color of my skin,” Abdullahi said. Montgomery, who represents the area, said that while this wasn't a political rally, she would be working in the city council to address the needs of a community in pain. "We as America, we as California, we as San Diego, have to look at our original sin. We have to turn away and repent from that,” Montgomery said. "And until we do that, buildings will burn.” San Diego-Area Protests Against Police Brutality Continue For Sixth Day – 5:25 p.m., June 3, 2020 For a sixth straight day, protesters calling for an end to police brutality demonstrated in the San Diego area Wednesday, joining like-minded activists taking part in rallies across the United States following the in-custody death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on Memorial Day. About 2 p.m., several dozen people assembled near Mira Mesa Recreation Center on New Salem Street to call for justice and change in the aftermath of Floyd's May 25 death. There were no reports of disturbances or violence at the gathering, SDPD public-affairs Officer Scott Lockwood said. Shortly before 3 p.m., more than 100 mostly young protesters congregated near a strip mall at Pomerado and Twin Peaks roads in Poway, chanting "no justice, no peace" and "black lives matter," and carrying signs reading "I can't breathe," quoting Floyd's dying words. After about a half-hour, the demonstrators moved into the adjacent intersection, knelt and sat on the pavement, lifted their fists in the air and fell silent for about nine minutes — the length of time a Minneapolis police officer pinned Floyd's neck to the ground with his knee while three other officers watched as the handcuffed Texas native gasped for breath and called out to his deceased mother. Around midday, the Ocean Beach MainStreet Association announced that it was canceling Wednesday afternoon's planned farmers' market — which was due to reopen for the first time after being closed for weeks due to the coronavirus crisis — due to another police-violence protest planned to take place in the coastal town later in the day. — City News Service Curfews Extended For La Mesa, El Cajon – 5:15 p.m., June 3, 2020 The emergency curfew order has been extended for the following cities.

In a carotid restraint, an officer compresses a person's carotid arteries, which are on either side of the neck, causing a person to lose consciousness. "In light of community concerns, and after consultation with many elected officials throughout the county, I am stopping the use of the carotid restraint by my deputies effective immediately,” Gore said in a statement. "I have and always will listen to any feedback about the public safety services we provide.” On Monday, Mayor Kevin Faulconer and San Diego police Chief David Nisleit announced that the San Diego Police Department would immediately stop using the hold. Gore had called the decision a mistake. "I'm reluctant to take that technique away from my deputies and force them into maybe a more, a higher use of force which will cause lasting damage to the suspect we're taking into custody," Gore told KPBS on Tuesday. The Racial Justice Coalition San Diego has renewed its call for law enforcement to end the use of carotid restraint in light of the recent unrest. Deputies Arrest Protesters For Curfew Violations In Santee – 6:50 a.m., June 3, 2020 Protesters in Santee were arrested for curfew violations after refusing to clear an intersection as a citywide curfew went into effect, authorities said Wednesday morning.

Ashley Lewis of the San Diego County Sheriff's Department. Some protesters left, but a vast majority refused to leave the area and a San Diego sheriff's Mobile Field Force was called to the intersection to disperse the remaining protesters, Lewis said. Multiple arrests were made and the remaining protesters cleared out, she said. No injuries were immediately reported. — City News Service Protesters Converge On County Admin Building On Third Day Of Protest Downtown – 6:50 p.m., June 2, 2020 For the third day in a row, hundreds took the streets of San Diego to protest racial injustice and police brutality. Tuesday's protest organized by young people started small in Balboa Park and grew in size as the day went on. Organizers made a point to remind participants that it was a peaceful protest. Around 1 p.m., the protesters marched to downtown San Diego and back. "What's going has to do with changing the system,” one protester told KPBS. "Giving cops a way to protect us, without injuring us, without hurting us, without killing us. And showing them that, hey, when it happens, we're not going to stand for it.” Around 4:30 p.m., protesters were on the move again, escorted by police, down Sixth Avenue to Broadway, then to Harbor Drive before ending up at the County Administration Center. Around 6:30 p.m., the group marched to San Diego City Civic Center, where they held a rally. Community Boards To Meet Regarding SDPD De-Escalation Of Force Policies – 6:30 p.m., June 2, 2020 Two community boards that review police practices will hold emergency meetings this week regarding the San Diego Police Department's de-escalation-of-force policies, it was announced Tuesday. The city's Citizens Advisory Board on Police/Community Relations will meet at 6 p.m. Wednesday, followed by a Thursday evening meeting of the Community Review Board on Police Practices, both of which can be viewed on the city's website and YouTube page.

Faulconer said public input is welcome regarding what SDPD policies should be updated or changed. "Many are crying out to be heard. We are listening," Faulconer said. "Your city is listening. Now we want to turn those words into actions." The meetings will be held amid protests against police brutality staged in San Diego and elsewhere across the country, and follow Monday's announcement by the SDPD that it is banning the use of the carotid restraint technique.

Demonstrations remained relatively peaceful on Monday, although arrests were made. Gatherings took place throughout the San Diego County. A peaceful protest, made up primarily of marching students, was held in Balboa Park Monday afternoon and was followed by demonstrations outside the San Diego and Escondido police headquarters as well as in the Hillcrest neighborhood. The protesters began marching in the early afternoon and reached the San Diego Zoo around 2 p.m., according to officials. The marchers decried police violence against African Americans and encouraged the nearly 150 people to remain peaceful. Participants chanted "no justice, no peace, no racist police," as well as the name of George Floyd, who died last Monday in Minneapolis after being taken into police custody, triggering protests and civil unrest in cities nationwide. Officials shut down a number of on- and off-ramps due to the march and reported no arrests. In the late afternoon, protesters began to collect outside the San Diego and Escondido Police Departments. The San Diego gathering began around 6 p.m. in the 1400 block of Broadway. SDPD shut down the east-west street to vehicle traffic between 13th and 15th street. Nearly 100 people collected near the San Diego police headquarters and faced four lines of police officers around 9 p.m. near the intersection of Broadway and 13th Street. Protesters chanted "George Floyd." Police presence increased in the area around 9:30 p.m. and a number of people were arrested 30 minutes later. Protesters continued to gather after the arrests, then scattered after a firework set off near the protest around 10:10 p.m. Police declared an unlawful assembly in the area of 1400 Broadway, near 14th Street, about 10:30 p.m., asking people to clear the area and move away or face being cited or arrested or "risk exposure to chemical agents and less-lethal force applications," the San Diego Police Department tweeted.

The demonstrators were peaceful as they held signs, chanted slogans and called out to passers-by, Petersen reported. The fourth protest on Monday began in the evening within the Hillcrest neighborhood. Close to 200 other protesters gathered and knelt at The Pride Flag near the intersection of Normal Street and University Avenue at 9:30p.m. Protesters then marched down Park Avenue around 10 p.m. Officers facilitated the peaceful demonstration, although one person was arrested for vandalism around 9:30 p.m., according to the San Diego Police Department.

Sheriff's Department Defends Use Of Tear Gas, Pepper Pellets In La Mesa Protest – 8 p.m., June 1, 2020 San Diego County Sheriff's Department late Monday issued a statement saying it only deployed tear gas and pepper balls on the crowds of protesters in front of the La Mesa Police Department headquarters after some in the crowd started throwing rocks, bricks and water bottles at officers and deputies. The move was decried by civic leaders as escalating the violence. After the tear gas was deployed, the largely peaceful protest devolved into chaos that eventually led to the looting of nearby businesses in downtown La Mesa and the torching of two banks in the area. Photo by Joe Hong Small flames still burn at Chase bank location on Spring Street in La Mesa the morning after destructive protests, May 31, 2020. The department said it supports peaceful protests and noted there are bad actors who exploit protests as a way to vandalize and loot. "There are people at these rallies exploiting the situation to discredit those peacefully assembled by looting businesses and setting fires to buildings,” the statement reads. "When demonstrations threaten life and property, law enforcement must act to restore safety in our communities.” – 6:20 p.m., June 1, 2020 A second protest began around 6 p.m. demonstrating near San Diego police headquarters.

San Diego Police Department To Cease Chokeholds As Method Of Restraint – 5 p.m., June 1, 2020 San Diego Police Chief David Nislet announced Monday the San Diego Police Department will no longer use the carotid restraint technique as a use-of-force procedure. The decision comes as demonstrators have taken to the streets from San Diego across the U.S. over the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis on Memorial Day, after being handcuffed and pinned to the ground by a white police officer. "We are watching the hurt and pain so many people are expressing after the tragic death of George Floyd, and are committed to taking new actions to make sure something like this doesn't happen in San Diego,” Mayor Faulconer said. "That starts today with the police chief's decision to immediately stop this particular restraint that has led to so much concern and frustration by many in our minority communities. I want to thank Chief Nisleit for listening to those demanding justice and doing the right thing.” Monday's decision follows discussions between community leaders and the city.

No racist police," as well as the name of George Floyd, who died Memorial Day in Minneapolis after being taken into police custody.

The California Highway Patrol closed some freeway on- and off-ramps in downtown San Diego as a precaution. The closures included westbound state Route 94 to F Street, the First Avenue entrance to southbound I-5, and the southbound I-5 exits to 10th Avenue and Front Street, the CHP reported.

San Diego County officially declared a state of emergency Sunday in reaction to police protests nationwide, and several cities imposed an overnight curfew. Jeff Collins, a county spokesman, said the state of emergency was declared in part so the sheriff's department could impose a curfew for unincorporated areas. He said it would also allow the county to seek federal reimbursement if needed. According to a news release, the curfew was to be imposed at 8 p.m. Sunday in several unincorporated communities including Lakeside and Spring Valley. According to the Sheriff's Department, all residents were urged to "stay home, indoors and off the streets." Violation of the curfew order is a misdemeanor and subject to a fine of up to $1,000 or up to six months in jail, or both. It was unclear if anyone had been arrested for violating curfew orders. Poway also imposed a curfew beginning at 8 p.m. Law enforcement, fire, medical personnel and members of the media are exempt from curfew, as are those commuting "directly to and from work, seeking emergency care, fleeing dangerous circumstances or experiencing homelessness," according to the city. Santee also imposed an 8 p.m. curfew. According to its web site, the city was asking residents to "please stay home and stay safe" with their families unless they need "to travel to work, seek medical care or are experiencing an emergency situation."

Also, for the time being the city is closing Allison Street between Spring Street and University Avenue and the Civic Center parking lot, said Councilman Colin Parent. Previously, the city had imposed a curfew on from 1:00 a.m. to 7 a.m. Sunday. The City Council's actions are in response to the riot and looting that took place in the city's downtown area Saturday night and early Sunday morning. Earlier on Saturday, demonstrators had staged a peaceful protest against a La Mesa police officer's actions last week toward an African American man. "These are extremely challenging times in La Mesa and the city government is taking whatever measures necessary to preserve the peace in our community,” Parent said. — David Washburn, KPBS editor Photo by Shalina Chatlani Protesters march through downtown San Diego in solidarity with the death of George Floyd, May 31, 2020. UPDATE: 12:23 p.m., May 31, 2020 Demonstrators Sunday morning staged a protest that began in downtown and at one point caused a portion of Interstate 5 to be closed to traffic for a short period. Beginning at 10 a.m., hundreds of protesters marched down to the San Diego Police Department headquarters on Broadway. As of the early afternoon, the protest had remained peaceful. At around 12:15, protesters made their way to the freeway in the East Village area of downtown, shutting down I-5 in both directions for a short time. According to a Facebook post, it is a "peaceful protest in solidarity of George Floyd,” the black man killed by a white police officer in Minneapolis. "We just want to be heard...we want everybody to know we stand in solidarity with George Floyd," said Ariel Gibbs, one of the event's organizers. "Hopefully we are heading for change. We see that we need a community review board to hold police accountable." The online post encouraged attendees to wear their masks but not to join if they are feeling sick. UPDATE: 10:16 a.m., May 31, 2020 The owner of the Play It Again Sports in downtown La Mesa returned Sunday morning to a waterlogged storefront from sprinklers that doused a fire set during the rioting Saturday night and early Sunday. "Destruction, complete destruction,” Daniel Buxton said of the building's condition. "The sprinkles were on for about five hours pouring water all over everything.” Buxton said looters armed with bats destroyed the inside of the store, including its computers. "Took what they could, destroyed what they could and got out,” he said. But Buxton said help from the community gave him hope about a quick path to re-opening. "I thought it was going to take a month, but with this kind of turnout, maybe it'll take a week, maybe less, maybe a day,” he said. While disappointed by the destruction, Buxton said he supported the right of people to speak out in protest. "I just never wanted it to turn into this obviously and I don't think this accomplishes anything for anybody, but I do think that people have a right to protest and should if they feel that they want to,” he said. — Joe Hong and Tarryn Mento, KPBS reporters Tweets by jjshong5 Photo by Matthew Bowler Community members clean up inside a vandalized Play It Again Sports in La Mesa and mop up water after a fire set during protests triggered an emergency sprinkle system, May 31, 2020.

"I come back this morning — it's like a war zone. It felt like we're actually in a war,” Duty said while standing near the Randall Lamb Associates building that was charred from an earlier blaze. Community members were cleaning up shattered windows and vandalized storefronts in the downtown area after the overnight protests turned violent. Duty, a retired teacher, said she was particularly affected by the death of George Floyd, which sparked the unrest across the country, because she is the mother to a 31-year-old black son. RELATED: What's It Like To Be Black In America Right Now? "He's been detained by the police, so it's right at home for me,” she said. "This is right at home when you let the police off and saying it's OK — it's not OK.” Duty said she was shocked by the damage from protestors but did not want to judge their actions. "I can't judge somebody else's anger or how they're going to protest — it is what it is. If this is the way of getting the world's attention, then that's how it's going to have to be,” she said. — Joe Hong and Tarryn Mento, KPBS reporters Photo by Matthew Bowler Community members in downtown La Mesa sweep up debris in front of the Randall Lamb Associates building that was burned on the inside, May 31, 2020.

UPDATE: 8:35 p.m., May 30, 2020 San Diego Sheriff's deputies deployed tear gas, pepper spray and rubber bullets Saturday evening to disperse protesters in front of the La Mesa Police Department. Around 6 p.m. the crowd started throwing water bottles and rocks at law enforcement. That's when deputies fired rounds of rubber bullets, pepper spray and tear gas into the crowd. The crowd momentarily dispersed but many have since returned, remaining in the parking lot in front of the building. Some protesters had painted graffiti on the station's walls and broke the windows. Around 8 p.m, authorities fired a barrage of tear gas and flashbangs at the crowd to clear the parking lot in front of the station. Dozens of law enforcement vehicles moved in right after to try to disperse the crowd. Earlier in the afternoon, protesters had peacefully marched in front of the department to demonstrate against ongoing police brutality across the U.S. Protesters then marched onto Interstate 8, blocking the freeway in both directions around Jackson Drive. The freeway remained blocked at 8 p.m. Earlier this week, a La Mesa police officer detained a black man at the Grossmont Transit Center Wednesday. The man was arrested on suspicion of assaulting an officer and the encounter was videotaped and appeared on social media. — Alexander Nguyen, KPBS web producer ORIGINAL STORY: An estimated 1,000 protesters blocked Interstate 8 in both directions Saturday to demonstrate against a police officer who detained a black man earlier this week. About 2:30 p.m., the crowd initially took over the La Mesa Police Department parking lot to protest an officer who detained a man at the Grossmont Transit Center Wednesday. The man was arrested on suspicion of assaulting an officer and the encounter was videotaped and appeared on social media. The protesters chanted "Black lives matter" and carried signs such as "no justice, no peace," as they marched down University Avenue. At first, the group was stopped when they tried to get on I-8 at the Baltimore Drive entrance by California Highway Patrol officers. But soon after, the protesters broke through the CHP line and continued marching eastbound on the freeway. The CHP then halted traffic on I-8 eastbound and when protesters began marching on the westbound side, traffic was then halted on that side of the freeway. About 4:30 p.m., CHP officers wearing face shields stood in a line across the freeway and squared off with protesters, some wearing face shields. A protester with a bullhorn appeared to be asking the crowd to back away from the officers, which they did. The protesters then left one side of the freeway and climbed over the center divider to get on the other side. Saturday's protest follows a Memorial Day incident in Minneapolis when a police officer, Derek Chauvin, was videotaped pinning George Floyd to the ground with his knee on his neck, which eventually led to Floyd's death. Chauvin was arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday. Outrage over Floyd's death built across the country and many protests have turned into rioting. La Mesa officials said they are launching an outside investigation into the Wednesday incident. — City News Service FEATURED PODCAST KPBS' daily news podcast covering local politics, education, health, environment, the border and more.
