(Brad Horrigan / Hartford Courant) Public outcry over the shooting of a 22-year-old woman involving Hamden and Yale police during a traffic stop in New Haven intensified Wednesday with calls from the community for a swift and transparent investigation and the firing of the officers. For a second night, protesters gathered Wednesday in New Haven at the site of the shooting and at the Hillhouse Avenue home of Yale President Peter Salovey. Advertisement Activists demanded the release of police videos of the incident — crucial, they said, in understanding what led to the early morning shooting Tuesday that wounded Stephanie Washington, a passenger in a vehicle police said was believed to be involved in an attempted armed robbery of a newspaper carrier at a Hamden gas station. Throughout the day, leaders and police officials met at the urging of New Haven Mayor Toni Harp, who said she was concerned about the shooting because it was in New Haven and did not involve city officers.

"Going forward, police activity that spills over into New Haven must be standardized and memorialized, so that while it is common and perfectly legal, it is also conducted within a manner that is consistent with the guidelines that apply to New Haven police personnel,” Harp said. Though he said little about the police shooting, Hamden Mayor Curt Leng said the investigation would be thorough and that he would work with Harp.

The Yale officer involved in the shooting was Terrance Pollock, a 16-year veteran of the department, the university said. Pollock also was placed on leave pending the outcome of the investigation, although Yale President Peter Salovey urged people to refrain from making assumptions about the circumstances of the shooting. In a letter to the Yale community released by state police Thursday, Salovey said Yale will cooperate fully in the investigation and "engage with our fellow members of the greater New Haven community."

The state police Central District Major Crime Squad is investigating, assigned to the case by New Haven State's Attorney Patrick Griffin. State police did not release any new information on the shooting Wednesday. According to the state police account of the event, Hamden and Yale police stopped a vehicle, a red Honda Civic, shortly after receiving a report of an attempted armed robbery about 4:20 a.m. at a gas station on Arch Street in Hamden, state police said. After blocking the car on Dixwell Avenue in New Haven, more than a mile from the attempted robbery, state police said that Hamden and Yale officers attempted to make contact with the driver, who abruptly left the vehicle, a state police spokesman said. The officers then opened fire.

During a morning conference call with Harp, Leng and New Haven, Yale and Hamden police, officials discussed how each department responded to the area. New Haven police were alerted by radio transmission, a spokesman for the mayor said. He added that Yale police said they were responding to a call from communication from the Hamden police dispatcher. While neither the Yale or Hamden police officers had their body cameras on on April 16, the recall function on the Hamden police officer's body camera was used to show the moments leading up to and including when Devin Eaton fired his gun. On April 16, Yale and Hamden police officers opened fire during a traffic stop, wounding a New Haven woman, officials said Tuesday. Amid questions and concerns about the police response, organizations at Yale called for immediate action to prevent another shooting. A petition to Salovey was circulated demanding that Yale fire the officer, disarm all other officers, make public the investigation and make a financial contribution to Black Lives Matter Global Network "in opposition to state-sanctioned violence” against black communities. Both the driver and Washington, as well as Eaton, are black. The race of the Yale officer could not be determined Wednesday. "We demand the termination of the officer involved in the incident, the immediate disarmament and demilitarization of the Yale Police, and a public reconciliation of their budgets, funding, policies, practices,” Yale Black Men's Union and Yale Black Women's Coalition said in a joint statement. Two hashtags were created, #Yalefiredfirst and #JusticeforStephanieWashington. The protesters encouraged one another to text Salovey with the hashtags, and they chanted for him to come out of his house. Two Yale police officers stood stoically at the gate to the front walk.

The group then set off on a march to the Hillhouse Avenue location to join the other protesters.
