Here are the players who protested in Week 16:Los Angeles Rams: Defensive end Robert Quinn raised his right fist during the national anthem before Saturday's game against the 49ers, as has been his custom since the start of the regular season. Quinn said he will continue to do so regardless of whatever backlash he receives on social media. Said Quinn: "People have the right to voice their opinion. It's up to you whether you listen to it or not. If people feel bad or feel upset about making a stand, that's their personal opinion and judgment. At the end of the day, I'm just standing up for what I believe is right." -- Alden GonzalezSeattle Seahawks: Seahawks players linked arms during the anthem before Saturday's game against the Cardinals, just as they've done for every regular-season game this season. -- Sheil KapadiaSan Francisco 49ers: Quarterback Colin Kaepernick and outside linebacker Eli Harold before Saturday's game against the Rams again knelt during the national anthem in protest of racial oppression and inequality. Safety Eric Reid, who is on injured reserve and has also knelt this season, did not travel with the team. -- Nick WagonerMiami Dolphins: Wide receiver Kenny Stills and safety Michael Thomas knelt for the anthem before the Dolphins' game against the Bills on Saturday. They've done so for every game this season. -- James WalkerSan Diego Chargers: Before Saturday's game against the Browns, offensive linemen Joe Barksdale, D.J. Fluker and Chris Hairston once again raised their fists during the national anthem. -- Eric D. WilliamsTennessee Titans: Following the national anthem before the Titans' game against the Jaguars on Saturday, linebacker Wesley Woodyard, cornerback Jason McCourty and defensive linemen Jurrell Casey, Al Woods and DaQuan Jones all raised a fist in the air. -- Paul KuharskyPhiladelphia Eagles: Safety Malcolm Jenkins raised a fist over his head during the national anthem before Thursday night's game against the Giants. He has been protesting since Week 2 against the Chicago Bears. Cornerback Ron Brooks once joined him, but he has not been present on the sideline the past nine games after undergoing surgery to repair a ruptured quad tendon. In early November, Jenkins discussed at length his reasons for protesting. -- Tim McManus FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmail
