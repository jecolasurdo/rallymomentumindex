(WDHN) — Protesters' chants could be heard echoing in downtown Dothan Sunday afternoon as a peaceful protest was held. A local Black Lives Matter group gathered on the Houston County Courthouse steps in protest of George Floyd's death. Protesters chanted "Justice for George” and "Honk for justice” and cars responded as they drove by. Change in prosecution and a change in narrative is what organizers say they wanted to achieve through the protest. "One bad apple spoils the bunch,” protest organizer Deandrea Peterson said. "All police officers aren't bad, but when you don't allow the justice system to be you know completely utilized and this persona and people like him continue to do things like that. It just perpetuates to the rest of the public that they cannot be trust and we need to change that narrative by prosecuting those officers that had to do with that man's death.” Deandrea said that everyone is angry but change won't come unless people get out and vote.
