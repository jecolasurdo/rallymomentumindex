Las Vegas Review-Journal and The Associated Press May 31, 2020 - 5:24 pm Updated May 31, 2020 - 8:13 pm About 100 people gathered to protest Sunday night near Downtown Summerlin, while another protest against police brutality was happening on the Strip. Metro Police just charged at the crowd who was peacefully protesting at Downtown Summerlin. #vegas #BlackLivesMatter #GeorgeFloydprotest pic.twitter.com/oroWkMuNH4 — Mick Akers (@mickakers) June 1, 2020 The mall already had closed at 4 p.m., and nearby Red Rock Resort closed at 5 p.m. Police already were at the scene Sunday evening and were barricading the shopping center, as well as Red Rock Resort. Some social media accounts were promoting a 7 p.m. protest at Downtown Summerlin, but many later discouraged people to attend because the mall is private property and because of the heavy police presence already at the scene. As of about 7:30 p.m., fewer than a dozen people had gathered on a sidewalk near the mall, and police remained in the area, blocking all entrances. People now gathering on all corners near Downtown Summerlin. #vegas #BlackLivesMatter #GeorgeFloydProtests pic.twitter.com/05yuoVqAfw — Mick Akers (@mickakers) June 1, 2020 The group peacefully marched around the perimeter of the mall but were charged at by police around 7:50 p.m. Police said they rushed the crowd because the woman leading chants was standing in the street. "Get out of the street,” officers yelled as protesters fled. Protesters were seen holding their hands up and filming the officers. By 8 p.m., about 100 people had gathered. Red Rock Resort and our restaurants will be closing early this evening at 5 p.m. We apologize in advance for any inconvenience. — Red Rock Casino Resort & Spa Las Vegas (@redrockcasino) May 31, 2020 Vandals hit California stores Elsewhere in the U.S., vandals looted shops and a restaurant burned Sunday afternoon in Santa Monica, California. Armed National Guard soldiers patrolled Los Angeles streets and cities across the state declared curfews to prevent violence after unruly demonstrators torched police cars, broke into stores and clashed with officers in riot gear. Los Angeles County declared a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew for its 10 million residents, though the cities of Santa Monica and Beverly Hills, which experienced looting on Saturday, imposed 4 p.m. curfews. San Francisco set a curfew of 8 p.m., and San Jose had an 8:30 p.m. curfew. Unrest in coastal Santa Monica on Sunday happened not far from a peaceful demonstration near the city's famous pier as a group of looters targeted shops near the popular Third Street Promenade. They broke into a Gap store and a Vans sneaker store, where KTTV footage showed people walking out with boxes of shoes with no police in sight. Protests also roiled the east San Diego suburb of La Mesa, where two adjacent banks burned to the ground and people smashed windows at many businesses. Across the country in Washington, D.C., protesters were milling around outside Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House and near cleaning crews who were clearing glass and boarding up windows that were broken during Saturday night's protest. Crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House. Review-Journal staff writer Mick Akers and The Associated Press contributed to this report.
