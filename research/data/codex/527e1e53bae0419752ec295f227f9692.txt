The NFL Players Association released a statement in response to Trump that said, "No man or woman should ever have to choose a job that forces them to surrender their rights." Maxwell tweeted a series of responses to Trump's speech on Saturday: Don't be surprised if you start seeing athletes kneeling in other sports now!! Comments like that coming from our president. WOW! ✊ ✊ ✊ — Bruce T Maxwell (@bruu_truu13) September 23, 2017 Yeah I bet he doesn't step to @Kaepernick7 in person and call him and the other protesters a "son of a bitch." Ignorance from our Pres— Bruce T Maxwell (@bruu_truu13) September 23, 2017 Inequality is being displayed bigger than ever right now as our president shows that freeedom of protest and speech is not allowed..— Bruce T Maxwell (@bruu_truu13) September 23, 2017 This now has gone from just a BlackLives Matter topic to just complete inequality of any man or woman that wants to stand for Their rights!— Bruce T Maxwell (@bruu_truu13) September 23, 2017 Maxwell, a 26-year-old second-year catcher for Oakland, was profiled by Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle: Maxwell was born in Wiesbaden, Germany, when his father, who also is named Bruce, was stationed there with the Army. The younger Maxwell is highly patriotic - he took great pride in the July 4 uniforms and catcher's gear he received this year - so his decision to kneel appears to be entirely in opposition to Trumps comments and in solidarity with the NFL players who have taken a knee for the anthem. The A's, immediately upon Maxwell's anthem protest, issued a statement of support: "The Oakland A's pride ourselves on being inclusive,” the statement read. "We respect and support all of our players' constitutional rights and freedom of expression.” After the game, Maxwell explained his decision, telling reporters, "My kneeling, the way I did it, was to symbolize the fact that I'm kneeling for a cause, but I'm in no way or form disrespecting my country or my flag.” Bruce Maxwell: pic.twitter.com/fRaVHf2gPs— Jane Lee (@JaneMLB) September 24, 2017 Next Up In MLB Cleveland spent last season hiding Nicolas Cage's face in lineup graphics Some kid snuck into a ballpark, and recorded a fairly pleasant message on a camera 'It's just business' Joe Kelly briefly forgets how to baseball, breaks a window Dr. Anthony Fauci outlines how sports could return this summer Ron Wright had the worst MLB debut of all time Most Read How the NBA's smart rings are supposed to detect coronavirus These rings could detect coronavirus up to three days in advance.
