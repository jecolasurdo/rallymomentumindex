Pasadena's usual Monday council meeting arrived after a weekend of riotous protests left parts of the Los Angeles in shambles, though Pasadena was largely spared. In the first five minutes of the meeting, it was apparent Vice Mayor Tyron Hampton was shaken by the video of Floyd's death, which showed a white police officer kneeling on the black man's neck for more than eight minutes until he ultimately died. Facing a county curfew on Monday and widespread protests in surrounding cities, Pasadena cut its council meeting short, pushing most of the substantial items into the future. But Hampton and Councilman John Kennedy used the opening minutes of the meeting to renew calls for an independent police oversight commission — a topic that was meant to be discussed at Thursday's now-canceled Public Safety Committee meeting. Critics of the Pasadena Police Department have long called for such a committee, though most of the city's elected officials have argued that the City Council is the oversight board for the Police Department. But Hampton and Kennedy, both African American men, disagree with their colleagues.

Hampton carried a sign with Floyd's face on it and said, "What happened in Minneapolis has happened in Pasadena, so let's not act like it hasn't happened.” He ran through an abridged list of black men killed by the Pasadena Police Department: Kendrec McDade, who was fatally shot by Pasadena officers in 2012. The city settled a lawsuit for $1 million. Reginald Thomas Jr., who died in Pasadena police custody in 2016. The city settled a lawsuit with his family in 2018 for $1.5 million. Christoper Ballew, who was beaten by Pasadena officers at an Altadena gas station in 2017. "We're blessed he's still alive,” Hampton said of Ballew. "This has happened in Pasadena, and the people are still working. We have to be able to hold people accountable.” Hampton said he's gotten phone calls and messages from friends and neighbors, asking if he's OK in recent days. "The truth is, I put a smile on my face everyday because I don't want to get shot. I want to go home. I have a 5-year-old daughter, and that's the truth,” he said to the crowd at City Hall.

He implored them to vote and to continue to hold elected officials accountable. It's something his fellow council members, Councilman Victor Gordo and Mayor Terry Tornek, echoed in remarks minutes earlier, though they didn't address Floyd's death with the same vigor as Hampton or Kennedy. Gordo praised the protesters and encouraged them to keep fighting. "Together, we're going to create a space that will allow this city, this community and ultimately this country to take stock,” Gordo said. "To realize that if we are not providing justice and fairness and opportunity for all of us, then we will not ever, ever meet our collective greatness as people.” Tornek made similar overtures, saying, "Silence is betrayal. All of you, who have come here tonight, have decided that you are not going to be silent and you are doing this in a way that will convince those that have the authority that you have the power to make a difference.” Tornek called for residents to support the city's struggling public school system, saying a solid education was "the way for people to get ahead in the United States.” Kennedy, who spoke ahead of his colleagues, shouted at the microphone as though he was channeling the Rev. Al Sharpton and other powerful speakers. "What's different about this death than any other death?” he began. "It is because we are all coming together and saying enough is enough. "Now hear me,” Kennedy roared. "We've been here before. What has changed? ... We've had a black president, and nothing has changed.” Related links Thousands attend George Floyd-inspired protests in Pasadena Pasadena protesters stage march, candlelight vigil to mark George Floyd's death Driver seen speeding away from demonstration with protester on hood in Pasadena Pasadena declares state of emergency amid violence in nearby LA Read more Pasadena news More protest coverage Like his colleagues, he encouraged the demonstrators and implored them to vote. He called for a reinvestment in black and brown communities; he called for no-interest loans; he called for land grants for the descendants of African American slaves and demanded clean and affordable housing for the city's homeless. In closing his speech, Hampton told the protesters to come back every Monday night to push Tornek and Gordo, who are both competing for the mayor's seat in November, to consider more police reform. "I'm typically smiling, but today I'm not” Hampton told the crowd. "I'm mourning the death of African American men and women who are continually dying and nothing is happening.” Newsroom Guidelines News Tips Contact Us Report an Error Get the latest news delivered daily!
