"And, I can't control how people act.

(Becky Metrick/PennLive)Confronting policeOne participant reflected on the fast deteriorating scene in Harrisburg involving mostly young people, who seemed to react at the arrival of police in riot gear."It didn't seem like there was any back and forth - it just seemed like after five or ten seconds, pepper spray went off and people started running,” said Sean Kitchen, a Harrisburg resident. "After that, kids reacted by throwing bricks, water bottles and rocks at the cop cars.”He noted that the protest was winding down and would have likely ended shortly after, but the dynamic changed at the site police in their gear."It definitely felt like things boiled over once police department showed up with riot gear and pepper spray,” Kitchen said. "Once they showed up and pepper sprayed, that's when kids started throwing rocks, bricks, stuff like that. I personally felt like this could have been prevented if the riot police didn't show up. There were no orders to disperse - police in riot gear just walked down Front Street, and within five or ten seconds.”Saturday night, a smaller group of protesters continued to march through the city, blocking Second and Walnut streets, near the Harrisburg police station.

Julia Hatmaker | jhatmaker@pennlive.comWolf urges restraintThe governor urged calm and peace amidst the unrest."This weekend, throughout Pennsylvania, people are protesting violence and injustice that occurs far too often against people of color," Wolf said. "Everyone should speak out because no one should be at risk of harm because of oppression or racism. We have seen these injustices happen in the Commonwealth, and this week, we were all shaken by the murder of George Floyd in Minnesota.”The governor said the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency has brought in additional staff at its operations center to monitor the protests taking place in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Harrisburg and other parts of the state.Wolf's emergency declaration, announced late Saturday, authorizes PEMA "to direct emergency operations in Allegheny, Dauphin and Philadelphia counties, allocating all resources and personnel as deemed necessary to cope with the situation.”The declaration allocates $2 million in unused appropriated funds to PEMA. And it allows the transfer of up to $4 million in unused appropriated funds to PEMA for expenses related to this emergency."People have every right to speak out and demonstrate, but it's unacceptable to take advantage of protests to incite violence, harm others and destroy property," Wolf said in a statement.Wolf also said his administration has offered assistance to communities around the state.The mayors of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh said they welcomed the additional aid.James Franklin: 'My heart is broken'The scenes across the country even compelled one of Pennsylvania's most venerated adopted sons to break his typical silence on matters outside his domain.Penn State head football coach James Franklin on Saturday spoke out about something not related to football."My heart is broken, my beliefs have been challenged, and my emotions are raw,” said Franklin, one of nearly 20 African-American head coaches in all of college football.His reflection, posted on Twitter Saturday, noted the "senseless” deaths of three African-Americans, George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, and Breonna Taylor, in 2020."These senseless deaths are a symptom of a larger problem and in moments like this, silence is deafening indifference,” Franklin wrote."Our country is at a critical point and it's imperative when the road is bumpy, the path convoluted, the reality heartbreaking, we remember who and what We Are. We Are a country of opportunity, a nation of ambition and a people rooted in diversity, shared experiences and hope. It's more critical now than ever, we recognize our differences should not divide us but truly strengthen the fabric of who We Are!The violent demonstrations seen across Pennsylvania mirrored the day of protest across the nation, with at least 30 U.S. cities roiled by protests over the death of Floyd.Angry protests even erupted in the nation's capital, with hundreds of demonstrators descending in front of the White House for hours overnight Saturday.Minnesota Gov.

"I feel I have an obligation to step up and say something.”For Reginald Guy Jr., who has spent a lifetime as a community justice fighter, the events of the week, with Floyd's death in the hands of police, and the unfurling of violent demonstrations harkened back to long-simmering and long-fought battles."As Dr. King said that kind of behavior is the voice of those who feel they've not been heard,” said Guy, co-founder of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Leadership Development Institute in Harrisburg.He rebuked the idea that outside agitators were responsible for much of the violence."Nationally, it's misleading to ascribe the disruption to outside agitators,” Guy said. "Some people are simply fed up and acting up. We have had knees in black throats in a host of matters like jobs, housing, education, voter suppression and healthcare, for years. However, what's required is a massive trained law enforcement presence to check the violence.”He commended Harrisburg Police and in particular Commissioner Carter for their handling of events."He's done a remarkable job,” Guy said. "I'm not saying I agree with police abuse of African Americans or the wanton shootings of black kids. I think Harrisburg is a better example of how to conduct oneself than a lot of other places have seen.”Additional reporting by David Wenner, Becky Metrick, Chris Mautner, Julia Hatmaker, Brian Linder, Sean Adams, Sean Simmers and Greg Pickel.More from PennLiveFlames in Philadelphia as hundreds protest death of George Floyd and police brutalityGeorge Floyd protests get violent in Harrisburg: PennLive photographer describes the scenePeople gather in Bethlehem to protest against police brutality after George Floyd deathProtester: Violence at Harrisburg's George Floyd rally 'could have been prevented' if not for riot policeHundreds protest in Philadelphia, other Pa. cities over the death of George FloydState troopers called in to assist Harrisburg police during violent clashes with George Floyd protestersHarrisburg rally calls for 'peace and justice' after George Floyd's death in police custodyNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
