Protesters gathered Monday in Foley Square to hold a demonstration in his memory. Some of them later held a die-in in Grand Central Terminal. Demonstrators also remembered Eric Garner, Akai Gurley and Ramarley Graham—local cases of unarmed men who were killed during confrontations with police. Those we spoke with say they will continue to protest their deaths until justice is served. "His death also catapulted the Black Lives Matter movement and I think it's made people more acutely aware of how unfair the grand jury system is in this country," one protester said. "We're here to never forget Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Ramarley Graham. I was just demonstrating up in the hood in the Bronx. We have to be constantly in the public's eye. We have to constantly tell them that this is unacceptable," another protester said. Protesters tell us they are planning other demonstrations, including one in front Barclays Center in Brooklyn during the NBA All-Star weekend.
