SACRAMENTO — People brought their message right to the doorstep of the Sacramento Police Department Tuesday, holding an "Occupy the Police Station” protest in the name of justice for Stephon Clark. Demonstrators said the occupation was a call for accountability but resident Sharon Dupree said it was not anti-police. "That's not where we are because we know all police officers are not the same,” Dupree said. "But we're here with unity and solidarity.” Sacramento's chapter of Black Lives Matter organized the demonstration. They say they will be occupying the police headquarters every Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday afternoon until their demands are met. "We're going to be out here until we get some kind of results and see some kind of consequences for the actions that they took on Stephon Clark,” said Black Lives Matter Sacramento founder Tanya Faison. She said that includes removing the officers who shot Clark from the force. Last year, Black Lives Matter organized a similar occupy demonstration outside District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert's office following Clark's death. Activists continued protesting for 49 weeks. Faison said this demonstration may also last an indefinite amount of time, adding the group has learned how to mobilize from last year's protests. "I think the only change is that we're being a lot more strategic as a city and we're in solidarity with each other a lot more than we were before,” she said. In response to the demonstration, Sacramento police told FOX40, "We're aware of the demonstration. We'll continue to monitor all activity outside our headquarters.” Dozens of protesters were both outside and inside Sacramento City Council chambers later Tuesday, at one point halting the meeting. Many of the protesters who were at the march in East Sacramento Monday night packed into the meeting. "I believe if you had been there, you would've been horrified. The peaceful demonstrators, yes, they were energetic,” said Rev. Mary Westfall. "Yes, they were full of feeling and emotion and anger and grief and outrage at what has happened in their city and, most recently, the DA's decision. But they gathered peacefully. I bear witness to that.” Sacramento Police Chief Daniel Hahn answered questions about how his department's officers handled the arrests of 84 people who were there. "I'd be happy to come back in a couple of weeks and give you the update of the facts that we've revealed. I'd be remiss if I tried to guess at what the facts are right now,” he said. Church leaders met with city officials and police for several weeks in preparation for the DA's decision, working to keep things peaceful on the streets. "We all promised that we're going to rise to a certain level of dignity and show Sacramento and show the nation who we really are,” said Rev. Kevin Ross, the senior minister of Unity of Sacramento. "I think we were failed tremendously last night.” "We're asking for justice and what that justice looks like is first, firing those officers,” said Berry Accius with Voice of the Youth. "For those officers to never walk the streets of Sacramento as police officers.” Follow along below as we provide updates on Tuesday's protest and city council meeting.
