It's up to you whether you listen to it or not. If people feel bad or feel upset about making a stand, that's their personal opinion and judgment. At the end of the day, I'm just standing up for what I believe is right." -- ESPN.com staffTennessee Titans: After the national anthem before the Titans' game against the Colts, linebacker Wesley Woodyard and defensive linemen Jurrell Casey and DaQuan Jones and cornerback Perrish Cox all raised a fist in the air. -- Paul Kuharsky FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmail
