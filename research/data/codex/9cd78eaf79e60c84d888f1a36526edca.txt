The sign read, "It is our duty to fight."The demonstration followed the release of the African American Policy Forum's report, "Say Her Name: Resisting Police Brutality Against Black Women," and was part of a nationwide day of action to protest the deaths of Aiyana Jones, Yvette Smith, Rekia Boyd and others.Protests also took place in metropolitan areas across the country including Chicago, St. Louis, Washington, D.C. and New Orleans, two months to the day after a veteran Chicago police officer was acquitted for the fatal off-duty shooting of 22-year-old Boyd who was wounded in the back of the head. The acquittal drew outrage from the victim's family and the African-American community.The San Francisco protest diverged from others in one respect: Demonstrators were topless. The group of mostly black women wearing brightly colored turbans and body paint evocative of some African tribes removed their shirts and undergarments. They held signs with the names of black women killed in incidents involving police and repeated the "ashay, ashay, ashay" call to ancestors.Chinyere Tutashinda, founding member of the BlackOut Collective and a member of the Bay Area chapter of Black Lives Matter, said the women followed the tradition of women in West Africa who bear their chests to say "enough is enough.""We also understand that we live in a country that commodifies black women and black bodies but ignores the death of black women and black girls," Tutashinda said.Women used their bodies "to make people stop and pay attention to the fact black women are being killed," she said.Tweeted a Twitter user whose handle is @BrownBlaze: "This action today was healing. So amazing. Black women are infinitely powerful, ya'll. #SayHerName."Boyd was killed in 2012 when a Chicago cop fired over his shoulder at a group of noisy young people.Jones, a seven-year-old girl, was killed in a Detroit police raid in 2010.Smith, then 47, was killed in 2014 in Texas after police responded to a 911 call at a house when she stepped through the doorway, unarmed."It is time to break the silence around black women and police violence. Black Lives Matter!" said one protester.Contributing: Stephanie TaylorAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Corrections Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Terms of Service Your California Privacy Rights/Privacy Policy Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info/Cookie PolicyContact Us Help Center My Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop Reprints & Permissions Advertise Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Pinterest YouTube Reddit Flipboard RSS10Best Grateful Reviewed Thanksgiving.com Job Network Moonlighting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett ClassifiedsThe City The Wall StorytellersÂ© 2020 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC.
