Hundreds march to protect immigrants Mark Curnutte, mcurnutte@enquirer.com Published 6:04 p.m. ET March 12, 2016 | Updated 6:58 p.m. ET March 12, 2016CLOSE Large, vocal immigration rally held Saturday in East Price Hill.

The statement this wall made, however, was to welcome people migrating from violent Central American nations -- not keep them out.No speaker in the 45-minute formal program of the Rally for Hope, which preceded the two-mile march, mentioned Donald Trump by name. The Republican presidential front-runner was in suburban Dayton for a rally earlier Saturday and is scheduled to appear at 2 p.m. Sunday afternoon in a campaign event in West Chester. Trump has continued to call for construction of a wall along the 1,900-mile U.S.-Mexico border to stop illegal immigration, and he wants Mexico to pay for it.Trump's anti-immigrant stance did add urgency and timeliness to the rally and might have prompted a better-than-expected turnout of an estimated 350 people.The formal program mixed testimonials from three Central American immigrants, including Miriam Zelaya, a native Honduran profiled Feb. 14 in The Enquirer, readings from the Bible and Quran and music."When strangers sojourn in your land, you shall do them no wrong, the strangers who sojourn with you shall be with as natives," reads a passage from the 19th chapter of Leviticus.Pro-immigration activist Austin Kocher of Columbus said, "We need to send a message to the U.S. government. Stop bullying our immigrants."In December, the Obama Administration announced that women with small children and unaccompanied minors from Central America who'd entered the country illegally, were detained at the border and who'd received a final order of deportation were now a removal priority. Since late January, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has rounded up 336 such migrants from Central America, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson announced last week. Since Oct. 1, 29,000 people have been arrested at the border and sent back on flights to El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala and other Central American countries. Another 128,000 Mexican nationals have been sent back, he said.Illegal immigration is a major issue in the 2016 presidential race. Trump has called Mexicans, especially, rapists and drug dealers. A report released Feb. 24 by the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonprofit, non-partisan research organization, calculated that the 11 million unauthorized immigrants in the United States pay $11.64 billion a year in income, sales and property taxes. In Ohio, undocumented immigrant workers pay $85 million in state and local taxes, and in Kentucky the amount is $37 million, according to the analysis.Even workers not paid on the books -- meaning they do not have an IRS identification number -- they contribute through sales and property taxes.Rally for Hope called for an end to the deportation of recent Central American arrivals.Several organizations co-sponsored the event, which started at Holy Family Church, among them were the Archdiocese of Cincinnati, Cincinnati Interfaith Workers Center, Northern Kentucky University Latin American students and Black Lives Matter: Cincinnati."We all have to be here," said Brian Taylor, Black Lives Matter steering committee co-chair. "Actions defending immigrant rights are under the umbrella of what we do."Marchers walked on the sidewalk on the south side of Warsaw Avenue, though the heart of the business district. Several African-American drivers honked and blared their car horns and made fists as a show of support. The peaceful rally ended without report of any confrontation. No counter-demonstration was held.Marchers chanted in English and Spanish: "No papers, no fear, immigrants are marching here."Catholic Charities Southwestern Ohio reports 351 unaccompanied Central American children who arrived since the start of 2014 live in Hamilton County. Its caseload is 210 of these isolated children or households headed by a single woman with young children.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://cin.ci/1pmP2pMFind JobsShare your feedback to help improve our site experience!
