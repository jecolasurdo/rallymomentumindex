There were several emotional prayer vigils Thursday."This one came very close to home cause it's a church," said church member, Linda Gilliam. Gilliam can be found at Second Baptist church every week, but the deadly shootings at a similar church in Charleston brings a new fear for her. "If you cannot go to somewhere you feel safe then where can you go," said Gilliam. And to Gilliam, the tragic event not only introduces fear to a safe place but interferes with today's racial progression. "Total shock, it brought back the whole civil rights era," said Gilliam. But she gathered with dozens of others to trump those fears and setbacks with unity and action. "I think it's important for the faith community to step up and say we are concerned cause we're all part of a community," said Gilliam. Second Baptist church prayed Thursday night not only for Charleston but for Richmond, the country, and the world. "This incident that happened in Charleston could happen here in Richmond or anywhere," said Second Baptist Church Reverend James Henry Harris. "Hatred and, in some cases, white supremacy has no barriers."Reverend Harris calls for our community to "be the solution" and he hopes that starts here with prayer, community conversation, and strategic planning. "We're trying to raise the level of black consciousness and the consciousness of all races," said Reverend Harris. "I think sometimes we have to move past conversation into action because we have to do for the generations and younger generations to come," said Gilliam. They're hoping to continue this conversation with city leaders so the church remains a safe place for all to go and feel welcome.Copyright 2015 WWBT NBC12.
