Phillip Davis of Greater Shiloh Church led churchgoers and community members in prayer Friday outside Easton City Hall in mourning for the nine victims of the Charleston, South Carolina, church shootings.Davis said he wanted to provide a "safe community space" to express feelings of anger and frustration, as well as begin to heal.It was only fitting, he said, that the faith community provide support for those who are left "wondering why" a racially motivated crime could still happen in America."Although we have made great strides, we are still divided in many ways," he said. "You can't heal until you recognize you're hurting."Davis' message was one of love for "our brothers and sisters" in Charleston, of forgiveness for confessed shooter Dylann Roof, and of trust in God."Where there is unity, there is strength," he said.Easton City Council member Ken Brown and Mayor Sal Panto Jr. joined the crowd of about 40, calling the shooting "somewhat incomprehensible.""To know that (racism) still exists in this country is sad," Panto said.Though Charleston and Easton are hundreds of miles apart, Davis acknowledged that "it could have been Easton" easily. What helps prevent Easton from becoming another tragedy, Panto said, is proactivity: "We're meeting now, not later," he said.Davis led the crowd in a verse of "Amazing Grace," as well as a prayer for the victims and their families, the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church community, Charleston, and the entire nation.The pastor said he hopes some good can be borne out of tragedy. Racism is "so ingrained that it'll take a long, hard conversation," but it is one that needs to take place, he said.A public gathering is one of the first steps, said Jason Vanderburg, a Greater Shiloh minister. He brought with him a sign calling for "Prayers for Charleston" and quoting a Bible verse.He said Greater Shiloh aims to engage the community, and the vigil was one of the many ways the church comes together to help those who are hurting."This gives the public a chance to express their emotions," he said. "It gives folks a chance to be a part of something greater than themselves."Shannon Lane may be reached at slane@lehighvalleylive.com or at 610-553-3383.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).Â© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
