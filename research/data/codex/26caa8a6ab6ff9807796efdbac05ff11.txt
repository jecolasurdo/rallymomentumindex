Crowds along the 101 Freeway in downtown Los Angeles protest the death of Minnesota man George Floyd. May 27, 2020. (CBSLA) The protest, which started out peacefully, turned violent after some individuals smashed the windows of two California Highway Patrol cruisers and jumped on the vehicles. At least one protester was taken away from the scene by emergency responders with unknown injuries after falling off a cruiser. A group was also seen burning an American flag in protest. The front sign at Los Angeles Police Department headquarters was later defaced with graffiti. Police confirmed Thursday that no demonstrators were arrested. The L.A. chapter of Black Lives Matter shared news of the protest at 211 W. Temple Street, the office of L.A. County District Attorney Jackie Lacey and LAPD headquarters. "I'm tired of seeing people who look like me murdered for no reason,” protester Jamiu Carter told CBSLA. "It's not new, it's been going on since day one.” An American flag is burned during protests against the death of George Floyd. May 27, 2020. (CBSLA) Other groups may have also responded to the demonstration, which shut down the 101 Freeway for about 15 minutes. Many of the people in attendance were seen wearing masks in observance of coronavirus guidelines. L.A. County Sheriff Alex Villanueva urged protesters to avoid unlawful behavior in a tweet on Wednesday night, saying, "I share in the nation's outrage over the tragic death of George Floyd. Police brutality is unacceptable under any circumstances, and in order to gain the public's trust, we have to respect the very rule of law, we are sworn to uphold.” LAPD responded similarly: "Earlier we saw people on the streets of Downtown L.A., at times going onto the 101 freeway, to protest the death of George Floyd. We hear your anger & your pain. We will always facilitate freedom of speech. Period. All we ask is that protests are held in a safe & legal manner.” Meanwhile, there were violent protests in Minneapolis overnight Wednesday. According to CBS Minnesota, buildings were set ablaze and one man was shot to death. Graffiti removed outside #LAPD Headquarters in downtown LA, following escalating protests over death of an unarmed black man while in police custody in Minneapolis. @CBSLA pic.twitter.com/KdkYpRKG76 — Kara Finnstrom (@KaraFinnstrom) May 28, 2020 The protests follow the arrest and death of George Floyd on Monday, who lost consciousness with the knee of a Minneapolis city police officer pressing against his neck. Floyd died hours later at a hospital. An undated photo of George Floyd. (WCCO) Video of Floyd's arrest spread Tuesday on social media. While lying facedown on the road, Floyd repeatedly says he can't breathe, which is reminiscent of the dying words of Eric Garner who died in 2014 after being held in a chokehold by an NYPD officer. The officers involved in Floyd's arrest — identified by the city of Minneapolis as Derek Chauvin, Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J Alexander Keung — have since been fired. They were called to the Powderhorn neighborhood of Minneapolis following a report that someone tried to used a forged document at a deli. Police initially said Floyd was resisting officers and appeared intoxicated. Floyd's death has drawn demands for justice across the nation.

The FBI, Minnesota Department of Criminal Apprehension and the Hennepin County Attorney's Office are currently investigating the incident. Comments (42) Ivette says: May 27, 2020 at 6:36 pm But if the death was caused in MN why are these people rioting in Los Angeles, CA? Reply Charlie Alvarez says: May 28, 2020 at 7:46 pm Because they are thugs who would be busy committing other crimes if they werent protesting. Reply Boomer Boomer says: May 28, 2020 at 8:04 am Stupidity prevails. And just what did this civil disobedience accomplish? As far as those flag burners? They should all be horse whipped by a group of Vietnam Veterans. Reply Jeannie says: May 28, 2020 at 12:38 pm I agree 100% with Boomer Boomer. Looting, burning the US flag, destruction of property; is this the way they honor George Floyd's memory? They are a disgrace. Reply Gabe says: May 28, 2020 at 2:05 pm media loves to divide us all Reply Marianne says: May 28, 2020 at 6:41 pm The black community is ANGRY! They are tired of this and are responding commensurate with their feelings. These riots are a revival of the 12th street riots in Detroit 1967 and Ferguson. If these officers are not arrested for and convicted of murder, I predict that the black community and the protesters will burn down the attorney general's office building. Rightfully so. How many more times will this happen before Police officers learn the difference between law enforcement and murder. It has to stop now! Reply Charlie Alvarez says: May 28, 2020 at 7:48 pm You are living proof that you dont have to be a male to be a THUG. You may be female but you are still a lawless thug.
