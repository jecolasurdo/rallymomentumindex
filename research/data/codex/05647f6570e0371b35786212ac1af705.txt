"I'm hoping we show love and support to our black community and that was the emphasis we want to give. But we also want to speak to our white community and start saying we need to stand up and be allies,” Shawna said.The walk started at the Children's Museum and went to the city hall, where city leaders spoke to the crowd."If somebody isn't proud of me, I'm proud of myself,” Adriana said.
