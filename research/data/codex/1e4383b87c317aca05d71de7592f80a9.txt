Wilson's mother, Lisa Hines, said her daughter was upbeat and looking forward to a second call when the two spoke on the day she was found dead, according to the Los Angeles Times.But prosecutors declined to pursue charges."There is insufficient evidence to prove that a reasonable person would have known that leaving Wilson alone for approximately 33 minutes would result in her death,” read a report from the district attorney's office. "Wilson's death was unforeseeable.”AdvertisementAfter Wilson's family filed suit against the city, Los Angeles eventually agreed to pay nearly $300,000 to settle the case.Jorge RivasPostsEmailTwitterSenior staff writerShare This StoryGet our newsletterSubscribeAdvertisement
