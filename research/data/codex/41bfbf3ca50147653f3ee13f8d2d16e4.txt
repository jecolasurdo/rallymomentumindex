It was the first council meeting since the city released body-cam footage of the deadly Dec. 9 confrontation between officers and Mitchell in the parking lot of a Carson Street supermarket. Mitchell's family and Black Lives Matter activists had demanded the video be released during protests at every City Council meeting since January. Now that the video — both edited and unedited versions — has been released to the public showing how Mitchell died, activists have been pushing their cause on social media, encouraging people to confront Torrance officials Tuesday to demand that the officers be publicly identified and fired. For months, the City Council has placed the topic of Mitchell's shooting on the agenda to give the activists a place to speak, but City Manager LeRoy Jackson said Tuesday's meeting would be "the last and closing update on Christopher Mitchell.” 'Split-second decisions' Jackson invited Police Chief Eve Irvine to address the crowd, and she told the activists: "The job of a police officer is difficult and dangerous. Sometimes they are forced to make split-second decisions.” Irvine said she recognized that it was difficult to discern what was happening in the officer's body-cam footage, but she said the city released the video to provide the public with factual information. "I hope the folks who have questions about this tape take the time to watch the video on YouTube,” Irvine said. Activists yelled over her, making it difficult to hear the end of her address, even when she was amplified by speakers and a microphone. "Shame,” they yelled, over and over again. "It could have been prevented, chief,” yelled Sherlyn Haynes, Mitchell's mother.. In response to ongoing calls for officers' names to be released, Irvine said they have been withheld because of credible threats — both the graffiti displayed in the city's video and additional threats that she said were made over social media. "Until all the evidence and facts are available, no disciplinary action, if any, will be taken against the officers,” she said. Incendiary comments prompt adjournment Following the trend of the previous three council meetings, activist Evan Regis Bunch's incendiary comments — as he went over his allotted three minutes of public speaking — once again prompted council members to take a recess. Bunch had demanded to know whether the Distirict Attorney's Office had an open investigation into Mitchell's shooting. When his time was up, he refused to leave. "You know what's going to happen now,” said Furey, shortly before recessing the meeting. Activists didn't leave the council chambers, even as police officers descended into the front of the room. They chanted: "Say his name: Christopher De'Andre Mitchell.” City Attorney Patrick Sullivan came back to say that if they protesters didn't clear the room, the meeting would be adjourned. The protesters didn't move. "Do y'all care if they finish their meeting?” asked one activist. Haynes cried as the protesters surrounded her: "My baby ain't gonna be home for Mother's Day.” For the first time all meeting, the room went silent. Police officers stood on the dais as protesters gathered in the front of the room and joined hands in prayer. 3 dozen protesters Before the meeting adjourned, the protesters — many of them now familiar faces — took their turn in three-minute intervals at the microphone. More than three dozen gave their support, calling for an independent civilian oversight commission and for the officers names to be released.

"Your cops assassinated my son and you assassinated his character — that's what you wanted the media to know,” she said, criticizing the editing and narration in the video, while chiding the police for including his criminal record in the video. Mitchell was in a stolen vehicle when officers approached him and ordered him not to move, but he lowered his hands from the steering wheel. Officers say he was shot four times when he reached for an air rifle between his legs, but that isn't evident from the video. Black Lives Matter Los Angeles posted an abridged, 32-second version of the unedited video that shows Mitchell's death and the moments directly afterwards. A title card preceding the video notes that Mitchell was killed in less than 15 seconds after officers made contact with him and that he appeared to be complying with police orders. At the time of publication, it had more than 350,000 views on Instagram. That same video was posted to Twitter, where it was shared by activists like David Hogg, a survivor of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, as well as celebrities, like actress Alyssa Milano and filmmaker Tariq Nasheed. Mayor doxxed Two posters from Black Lives Matter Los Angeles also have been circulating around social media — one, with a picture of Mitchell,and another with a picture of Furey with a caption reading: "DO YOUR JOB!” It included the mayor's office phone number and implores the public to demand that the city release the names of the officers who were involved in the shooting. That was the same message activists delivered to Furey's doorstep April 30, when the council was recessed for the week. In a video posted to Facebook by activist Mateo Nagassi, a dozen or more protesters are seen calling for the mayor to come out of his house. They chanted: "Black lives, we matter here,” and "Shame on you, Pat.” In a video posted by filmmaker Scott Lane to his YouTube page, LOUDLABS NEWS, three police cruisers are visible outside the mayor's house. "We're here in front of Mayor Furey's house basically to get answers on why the killer cops murdered my son,” Sherlyn Haynes, Mitchell's mother, said to the camera. "They released a video slandering my son's name to the media to mislead them because Torrance Police Department murdered my son.” "I want those officers to be held accountable,” she said. "I want them to go to jail.” At one point, Bunch — now a fixture at the Torrance City Council meetings — called on Furey with a megaphone: "Answer to this family. Answer to this community. Why did those officers kill Christopher De'Andre Mitchell in 15 seconds? Why did the chief of police slow down the video to try and cover up the murder?” In another video on social media, Haynes and several protesters are seen ringing the mayor's doorbell. When Furey answered, Haynes asked, "Mayor, what you going to do? The Torrance Police Department murdered my son. I want answers. I want the police officers fired. I want you to help me to do that.” "This is no place for this, thank you,” he replied, before closing the door.
