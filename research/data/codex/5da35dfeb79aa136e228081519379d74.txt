They headed north toward Chambers Road, well north of the main protest area.Until then, there had been only spotty protesting by small groups. The marchers gathered at West Florissant and Canfield Drive and headed south, chanting, "I am Mike Brown."As they approached Solway Avenue, police cars entered the roadway to block it. The marchers then turned around and headed back north.It was the only event so far this evening that appeared to have much energy. The marchers continued north past the gutted QuikTrip, at 9420 West Florissant, and north toward Chambers Road. A few marchers tried to sit in the road at West Florissant and Highmont Drive, but police officers persuaded them to move along.No arrests were report.Earlier in the evening, small groups of protesters, often in twos and threes, walked along the sidewalk, raising their arms in the "hands up" pose if a passing car drew their attention. Few are carrying signs. The numbers of police officers and news reporters milling about also are down considerably. Shortly before 8 p.m., fewer than 100 people were taking part in slow-moving protests along the sidewalks. At the police command post in the Westfall shopping center, south of the main protest strip, a much-reduced Missouri National Guard detail remains posted at the entrance. Gov. Jay Nixon had said Thursday that he would send them home, but it hasn't happened as of Friday night.Also way down is the collection of TV satellite trucks on the lot of the Westfall plaza, formerly Northland. The crowds always have grown in size after sunset, even during the past two evenings of relatively tranquil protests. But at 7:30 p.m. Friday, the scene was much quieter and the crowds smaller than they had been 24 hours before. Weather could be playing a part. It was 91 degrees at 7 p.m., but the heat index lingered at 103 -- mitigated only by a merciful breeze. The humidity was a shirt-soaking 60 percent. It still was 85 degrees at 10 p.m., with the heat index at 96. Chris Hardy, who lives near the Canfield Green apartments, bought a "Justice Now" T-shirt from one of the vendors who are hawking protest-theme wares. Hardy said difficult issues still remain over the shooting of Michael Brown, 18, on Aug. 9 in the apartment complex. But Hardy said the atmosphere on West Florissant is losing its menace."Now the people you see, that's Ferguson," said Hardy, who is in his 50s. "I just hope the elders in the community keep stepping up and holding things in check. (U.S. Attorney General) Eric Holder put a calm to it, and the police have done a good job of stripping the agitators off." - Joe Holleman, 10:30 p.m.• • •Father of shooting victim moved by the line of rosesMichael Brown's father visited a memorial to his son that has grown at the site where the 18-year-old was shot on Aug. 9. Flowers, signs and stuffed animals have been piled on the spot on Canfield Drive where Brown was shot and killed by Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson in an incident that sparked nearly two weeks of protests. On Thursday night, a line of roses were laid down in a line in the road toward West Florissant Avenue, and by Friday afternoon there were perhaps a thousand of them. Michael Brown Sr. hugged well-wishers who recognized him and came to share words of encouragement or brief prayers. Anthony Shahid, an activist who was accompanying Brown Sr., said he didn't want to speak to the media. He was exhausted, Shahid said, and just wanted to see the memorial to his son.His wife, Cal Brown, who is the younger Brown's stepmother, said her husband wanted to see the roses."He's kind of floating," she said of his state. The visit marked Brown Sr.'s first visit to the site since a candlelight vigil not long after the shooting. "It's beautiful," Cal Brown said of the roses. "It really is." Gina Gowdy, of St. Louis, was one of the people who greated Michael Brown Sr. She said she also said a brief prayer to give his family strength."This young man did not deserve to die the way he did," she told a reporter, her voice hoarse from participating in protests. "I make it my business to come donw here, to show my support for the Brown family and for my children, because they are our next generation."- Denise Hollinshed, 1:15 p.m. Friday• • •Two officers suspendedTwo police officers were suspended Friday in controversies linked to the Ferguson protests. A St. Louis County officer who has worked at the scene of the protests, according to CNN, was suspended after incendiary comments he made in a taped talk he gave to a group called the Oath Keepers of St. Louis and St. Charles in 2012 drew attention Friday. Meanwhile, a Glendale officer was suspended for comments he made on Facebook about Ferguson protesters. He called them "animals" and said they "should have been put down like rabid dogs the first night," according to The Daily Caller, which preserved the postings. Read the full story here. -Staff, 5:30 p.m. Friday• • •Donations roll in for officer's defense, other expensesDonations through online funding sites set up in support of Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson have reached nearly $250,000, but some want at least one of the pages taken down because of inflammatory comments posted by donors.More than 6,000 people have donated in four days to two different sites on GoFundMe.com. The first says that the funds will be used to cover "potential legal fees, relocation and living expenses of both Officer Darren Wilson and his immediate family." The description says the group supporting him includes people who have never met Wilson and also those who are close family friends or "even family themselves." The group said they are closing down the first page and started a new one Thursday through a charity, Shield of Hope, so deductions could be tax deductible. Meanwhile, more than 150 people had signed a change.org petition saying the comments left by donors on GoFundMe promoted hate and racial intolerance. Some wanted the comments removed, others the whole page taken down. GoFundMe tweeted early Friday that administrators have removed donors' comments posted in violations of the site's terms.- Jessica Bock, 4 p.m. Friday• • • Eight arrested overnightAuthorities said today they arrested eight people overnight. Five arrests were for refusal to disperse. The others were for a warrant, careless and imprudent driving and tampering with a vehicle.Of the eight, one person was from Ferguson. Two were from outside Missouri — a man from Detroit and a woman from Minnesota. Three were from St. Louis city, one from Olivette and one from unincorporated St. Louis County. See where more than 200 people previously arrested in the protests are from. - Jessica Bock, 12:30 p.m. Friday• • •Grand jury makeup revealedThe grand jury that is hearing evidence in the Michael Brown shooting death has one black man and two black women on the panel, and six white men and three white women. The demographics roughly reflect the racial breakdown of St. Louis County's population, which is about 24 percent black and about 68 percent white.Read more here.-Jeremy Kohler, 10 a.m. Friday• • •Activists plan town hall meeting on Michael Brown shooting Monday Local and national activists have partnered with The Missouri History Museum to host a town hall meeting at the museum at 6 p.m. Monday "in response to the violence and on-going hostilities” between community and police in Ferguson.Read more about the town hall here. - David Hunn, 1:40 p.m. Friday• • •Pentagon says little of the equipment seen in Ferguson came from military A Pentagon spokesman said today that almost all of the military-style equipment used by local law enforcement in Ferguson over the last 13 days did not come from the Department of Defense.Most of the $4.3 billion worth of surplus equipment transferred to local law enforcement has not been tactical, but more mundane items such as furniture and communications equipment, Rear Admiral John Kirby said in a press briefing.Some public officials and activists have criticized the "militarization" of the police response to peaceful demonstrations, looting and violence after the shooting death of Michael Brown, 18, by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. Read more about the controversy here. Also:In wake of Ferguson, McCaskill plans hearings on 'militarization' of police Ferguson highlights police use of military gear and tactics - Chuck Raasch, 1 p.m. Friday• • •High temperatures, lower tension in FergusonSummer heat beat down upon the protest strip Thursday, but the tension seemed to be cooling.Marchers were sparse on a hot Thursday night along West Florissant Avenue, scene of nightly protests — often tense and sometimes violent — since Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Michael Brown, 18, on Aug. 9. The shooting scene, a street in the Canfield Green apartments, is just off West Florissant, and a three-block stretch of that suburban commercial route has been the place of turmoil. At a press conference shortly after 1 a.m., Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald S. Johnson said there had been seven arrests late Thursday and into early today. Five were for failure to disperse and the other two for minor offenses as well, he said."Today we had a good day," said Johnson, who is in charge of the security forces on patrol in Ferguson. The relative quiet of Thursday continued a trend since Monday night, the last time police officers in riot gear fired tear gas into unruly mobs.Gov. Jay Nixon said he would withdraw the small Missouri National Guard unit that has been guarding the "unified command” headquarters at the Westfall Plaza, formerly Northland. He sent in the unit on Monday. But a few soldiers and a Humvee remained on duty Thursday night near the gaggle of TV satellite trucks. The big networks remain on the story, but the number of TV trucks was about 25 percent smaller than a few nights before.About 150 protesters marched along the sidewalks. Police officers stood in small clusters or guarded businesses. The only tense moment was about 10:40 p.m., when a motorist on West Florissant stopped and began exhorting the crowd. Police tried to stop him, but he drove off, heading south. Officers stopped him near Lucas and Hunt Road. At least five people were arrested on charges of failure to disperse, the standard charge filed from West Florissant. Police said they arrested people who tried to agitate the crowd and wouldn't stop when warned. Otherwise, the crowd kept moving. Shortly after 11 p.m., Johnson, County Police Chief Jon Belmar and city Police Chief Sam Dotson mingled with protesters at West Florissant and Ferguson Road. A few shook hands with the chiefs, and one said, "You guys, go get some rest.” Mel Adou of St. Louis, a native of Ivory Coast, visited the memorial of teddy bears and candles at the shooting scene and chatted with Stan De Saint Hippolyte, Washington correspondent for the TV network France 24. De Saint Hippolyte flew into town Tuesday, but his crew was packing to go."We arrived too late,” he said.Adou said he had needed to see the place. "I shed a few tears when I first got here, picturing Mike Brown laying in the street,” he said. Before sunset, a small group of people quietly laid a long, neat row of long-stem roses along Canfield Drive, where Brown was shot.The high temperature Thursday was 96 degrees, the third-hottest day in an otherwise mild summer, and hung in the upper 80s at midnight. The forecast is for temperatures near 100 today through the weekend.Johnson, commander of the combined law enforcement effort, said he believed there were two reasons for reduced tension — the announcement that the St. Louis County grand jury began reviewing the case on Wednesday, and the visit on that same day of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder."I think it shows that the process has begun, and people know the president is watching,” Johnson said. After chatting with members of the Zainabiya mosque in North County, Johnson said, "At least this has shown that we need to be talking together all the time, all the races.” Two protesters also welcomed the grand jury. "At least the process has started and I think that allowed people to take a breath,” said Kelly Poole, of St. Louis. His friend, Michelle Seddins, agreed to a point: "It won't really be solved until (Officer Wilson) is behind bars. This is not something that can be swept under the rug.” Nixon said he was withdrawing the National Guard because "the situation has greatly improved, with fewer incidents of outside instigators interfering with peaceful protesters, and fewer acts of violence.” Nixon said the Highway Patrol will continue running the peacekeeping duties with help from local police departments. In Clayton, conflict continued over the role of St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney Robert McCulloch. Many protesters have demanded he step aside or be removed for a special prosecutor, but McCulloch has insisted he will stay on the job. Nixon made it clear that the prosecutor was staying."No,” the governor said Thursday, when asked again if he would remove McCulloch.But about 50 protesters gathered Thursday morning outside the County Justice Center in Clayton, where McCulloch has his office and the grand jury is meeting. State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, told the crowd she was there to deliver an online petition bearing 70,000 signatures demanding a special prosecutor. "Those signatures are coming from everywhere, throughout this country and worldwide,” she said. "People have made a statement that they have no confidence in (McCulloch's) ability to be fair and impartial ... They don't think he will do the right thing.”McCulloch said his office will be presenting evidence to the grand jury for a while, probably through mid-October.He also released a statement reiterating that he won't step down. In case anyone still wondered, it was typed in all capital letters. "The family of Michael Brown deserves an answer, the people of Ferguson deserve an answer and the people of the entire area deserve an answer,” his statement said. By Tom Borgman 314-340-8355 ARRESTS DWINDLECounty police reported that officers have arrested about 200 people since the turmoil began Aug. 10 with the looting and burning of the QuikTrip, 9420 West Florissant, the night after Brown was killed.But police made only seven arrests overnight Wednesday, down sharply from roughly 50 on each of the two previous nights. Most of the charges filed were refusal to disperse. And most of those arrested are from North St. Louis County and St. Louis city, although 21 of those arrested are from far-away places, including San Francisco, Austin, Texas, and Westport, Conn. The report says those arrested include 58 from St. Louis city and about 70 from the North County area, including nine from Ferguson itself and 23 from Jennings, its neighbor to the east.Kim Bell, Steve Giegerich, Lilly Fowler, Joe Holleman, Denise Hollinshed, Walker Moskop, Tim O'Neil and Virginia Young, all of the Post-Dispatch, contributed to this report. 0 comments Tags Ferguson Highway Patrol Capt.
