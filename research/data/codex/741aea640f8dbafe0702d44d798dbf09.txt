(Chris Riley—Times-Herald) By Thomas Gase | tgase@timesheraldonline.com | Vallejo Times HeraldPUBLISHED: June 5, 2020 at 2:59 p.m. | UPDATED: June 5, 2020 at 3:01 p.m.For 8 minutes and 46 seconds, the staff of La Clínica in downtown Vallejo were silent. Some took a knee, some stood, some sat, but all of them were quiet. That being said, they're hoping their message on racial discrimination is heard loud and clear. The members of the staff were part of a nation-wide event where medical professionals were asked to join in with peaceful protests organized by the White Coats for Black Lives movement. White Coats for Black Lives started back in late-2014 when medical students believed that their school campus remained "silent and detached” from the national dialogue on racism. The 8-minute, 46-second moment of silence was in recognition of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis in late May after Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, knelt on Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes while Floyd was handcuffed face down in the street, saying, "I can't breathe.” Two other officers further restrained Floyd and a fourth officer prevented onlookers from intervening. During the final three minutes Floyd was motionless and had no pulse. "I thought really hard during that time (the nearly nine minutes of silence) about George Floyd,” Araceli Villagrana Robles said. "If you think just sitting down or kneeling for that much time is hard, imagine not being able to breathe for that long.” Villagrana Robles, a Clinical Office Assistant, held a sign that stated, "We Said — Black Lives Matter. Never Said — Only Black Lives Matter. We Know — All Lives Matter. We just need your help with #Black Lives Matter for black lives are in danger.” Associate Medical Director Victoria Owens, a 2010 St. Patrick-St. Vincent graduate, echoed that statement. "It's such a long period of time,” Owens said. "How the officers could do that and let it happen is heartbreaking. We can't say 'All lives matter' until we are able to have 'black lives matter.' We can't say we have equality until everyone is treated equally.” Chauvin has been charged with second-degree murder, and the other three officers involved were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder. Quentyn Manuel, who works security at La Clínica and is a 2012 Vallejo High graduate, spoke to his colleagues as well as the Times-Herald moments after the silence ended. He held up a sign discussing Floyd, Breanna Taylor and Willie McCoy. The sign asked to say their names or "Are you going to let it slide?”” "I just want to thank all my co-workers for their support today,” Manuel said. "This has been going on for centuries. I've had a few run-ins with the police myself with racial discrimination. They continue to get away with it. And this isn't just my race, but every minority out there that has to go through with this.” Karla Bailey and other medical workers at La Clínica in downtown Vallejo hold signs during a nationwide White Coats for Black Lives vigil on Friday. (Chris Riley—Times-Herald) Karla Bailey, a family nurse practitioner who lives in Fairfield, was glad to part of the nation-wide event on Friday. "It's amazing and emotional,” Bailey said. "I remember being in Oakland in the 1970s at the height of the Black Panther movement. Things have changed, but they need to continue to change. It's such a blessing walking out of the building with my co-workers and doing this.” The silent tribute also featured many signs giving support for Black Lives Matter. Simona Atilano, held one of two signs made by her daughter, Yolanda Atilano. The signs had the names of approximately 50 people who had been targeted with racial discrimination by police officers, while the middle of the sign said, "Say their names.” "During the silent tribute I was thinking, 'How could these police officers not know this man (Floyd) couldn't breathe? It was a little painful to sit there for the eight minutes and think that,” Simona said. "I'm so happy and proud that my daughter was part of two peaceful protests and made these signs. I'm proud that my co-workers are doing this. I have today off, but I was glad to come in and do this today.” Sign up for email newsletters Subscribe Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Most Popular Driver of SUV that plunged off Carquinez Bridge identified City of Vallejo pencils in $25,000 budget hit on naval museum Coronavirus: Solano County giving away free reusable masks at three locations Benicia couple fights proposed dispensary site Coronavirus: Here's who has to wear a mask in California and when Vallejo's police union files restraining order to block release of officer's name involved in Monterrosa shooting Four dead in East Bay after SUV plunges off Carquinez Bridge Vallejo police investigating suspicious death Tags: George FloydNewsletter Thomas Gase | Reporter Been working at the Times-Herald full time since early 2011, was a stringer from 2001-2004 while in college at San Francisco State where I studied Journalism.
