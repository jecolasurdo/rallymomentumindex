Clemmons was struck twice in the back and once in the hip after he fled from Lippert after a traffic stop. Police say Clemmons had a gun and refused to drop it. About 70 people marched behind members of the Clemmons family, carrying signs that accused the mayor and chief of police of being complicit and calling for Lippert's termination. They started in Fannie Mae Dees Park, also known as Dragon Park, which organizers chose for its location in a part of town known for being affluent and predominantly white."We want to show that Nashville is unified in support of change, that people who are normally not sitting at the table should be sitting at the table," said Theeda Murphy, an organizer with the Justice for Jocques Coalition. "And we want those people to be seen out of context." After they began marching up Blakemore Avenue from 24th Avenue South, Metro Police Lt. Blaine Whited fell in behind them, occasionally ordering them out of the street over his patrol car loudspeaker."If a vehicle strikes you, it will be your fault," he said.They remained in the street without incident. When they arrived at the mayor's home on 20th Avenue South shortly before 8 p.m., Clemmons' children and their mother, Tameka Lewis, leaned the black coffin up against the fence. Neighbors came out of their houses to watch as the group chanted, prayed and performed spoken word. After the march, Barry issued a statement on Twitter. "I appreciate and respect the right of Nashvillians to voice their opinion through peaceful protest." Barry said. "I am glad to see that everyone remained safe and I appreciate the Metro Nashville Police Department doing their part to ensure that happened."Police partially blocked off intersections and streets ahead of where the demonstrators marched.► Related: Community reaction: No prosecution in Nashville officer-involved shootingDavidson County District Attorney Glenn Funk declined to press charges against Lippert on Thursday, but Funk did criticize Metro police for how it handled its investigation into the shooting.Following Funk's announcement, the Clemmons family, the NAACP and the coalition held a news conference where they expressed disappointment but not surprise.

It's part of a larger report that the advocacy organization says shows police stop black drivers at a higher rate than other drivers.► Read more: Nashville police chief blasts DA's accusation of bias during Jocques Clemmons investigationThese groups and others have repeatedly called for police department reforms, including a civilian review board with independent investigative authority.
