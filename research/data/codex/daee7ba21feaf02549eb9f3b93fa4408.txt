"We don't have to look all the way to Minneapolis,” she said, "to know this is happening in our own backyards.” Demonstrations have swept the nation this week, with thousands of protesters demanding justice for George Floyd, an African American man who died after a white officer kneeled on his neck in Minnesota. Some protests have turned violent, including in Minneapolis where protesters burned businesses. Rioters smashed police cars and windows in Atlanta, broke into police headquarters in Portland, Oregon, and chanted curses at President Donald Trump outside the White House. The National Guard has been activated in some cities. In Los Angeles, protesters began marching through downtown streets on Wednesday, when a faction shut down the 110 freeway. Those demonstrations continued Thursday and dissolved into chaos Friday evening, when businesses were looted and police vehicles were attacked. Police spent the night and early morning responding to scattered violence all over downtown, and made up to 500 arrests. Police worked until early this morning to break up groups who broke store windows, set fires and roamed the downtown streets cordoned off by hundreds of police officers and dozens of their vehicles. After a bit of rest, I had a chance to put together a few of the sights and sounds from the #GeorgeFloydprotest in #SoCal Saturday. As more unrest continues Sunday, a curfew has been set for 6pm in #LosAngeles county. pic.twitter.com/I39FUVU2zt — David Crane (@vidcrane) June 1, 2020 The Associated Press and City News Service contributed to this report.
