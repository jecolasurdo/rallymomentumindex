(Jonathon Gruenke / Daily Press) Standing on the same ground that the first enslaved African Americans arrived on nearly 401 years ago, Elizabeth Williams couldn't put into words what that meant for her and her two teenage daughters. "It's frustrating,” Williams said as hundreds gathered around her at what is now Fort Monroe in Hampton, but was known as Point Comfort in 1619. "We've known as a black community that this has been needed for a long, long time.” Advertisement She was referring to the demonstrations that have happened every day for a week across Virginia and the country to rally against police brutality in response to George Floyd's death. The black man died when a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. At Fort Monroe, rally goers gathered in front of the Chamberlin, showing up with their young children and dogs in their Sunday best at the direction of the organizers, a group known as Black Lives Matter 757. Men came in suits and ties; women in high heels and dresses. The pattern on some women's silk head scarves matched their face masks. A DJ set up under the gazebo, playing music and encouraging people to dance.

(Jonathon Gruenke / Daily Press) Phyllis Terrell, a spokeswoman for Fort Monroe, said it was one of the largest crowds she'd seen there. The other large crowd that came to mind for Terrell was the commemoration of the 400th anniversary of the first enslaved Africans coming to Virginia's shores, which was held at the fort last year. "You look beautiful,” Yugonda Sample-Jones, the vice president of the Newport News NAACP, told the crowd. It was the first protest for Williams and her teenage daughters, Imani and Niya, who drove from Virginia Beach. At 15, Niya is expressing herself through poetry and artwork, her mom said. Williams showed a reporter a photo of Niya's latest artwork, the outline of a woman's face against a red background, surrounded by the words "I can't breathe.” Hundreds of people gather during a protest at Fort Monroe Friday evening June 5, 2020. (Jonathon Gruenke / Daily Press) As the water around the fort crashed against the rocks in the background, rally goers held a moment of silence for Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and other African Americans who have died at the hands of police. They chanted their names, and the names of local black people who have been killed by police, including William Chapman II, an 18-year-old who was shot and killed outside a Portsmouth Walmart in 2015. The officer who shot him, Stephen Rankin, was convicted of manslaughter. Organizers spoke of the importance of voting and attending civic meetings to spark change. A volunteer, Renee Wood, helped register to people to vote. One woman sang a song she wrote, titled "I can't breathe.” By 7:15 p.m. — to be mindful of the 8 p.m. curfew Northam has ordered through Saturday in Hampton — the crowd was dispersing. As they walked along the water back to their cars, a rainbow appeared.
