Dozens of protesters blocked the roadway near 25th St. in Kips Bay about 9:15 a.m. Advertisement Cops were responding. There was no immediate word on arrests. Pantaleo is set to appear at a departmental trial beginning Monday to fight the charge that he used a chokehold on Eric Garner, whose death after repeatedly gasping "I can't breathe” was captured on video published by the Daily News and sparked worldwide outrage and helped spark the Black Lives Matter movement.
