Author: WTLV Staff Published: 6:54 AM EDT July 11, 2016 Updated: 6:41 PM EDT July 11, 2016 JACKSONVILLE, Fla.— Three people were arrested after a Black Lives Matter protest, attended by hundreds in Jacksonville Sunday. Police say the three, Mina Salahshor, Dominique Smith, and Joseph Smith, were taken into custody because they were blocking traffic on the Main Street Bridge and would not stay on the sidewalk. The three bonded out of jail overnight. The protesters started their march at the Duval County Courthouse on W. Adams Street. Hundreds showed up for the protest at the courthouse protesting the police violence against citizens, specifically black men and women. There were also 'All Lives Matter' protestors there defending local law enforcement. Around 2:30 in the afternoon, the protesters started to move toward Interstate 95 downtown, threatening to close down the highway. Members of the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office stood near the Prime Osborn Center, not letting the protesters past. From the Osborn they headed toward Riverside Avenue and marched in front of Unity Plaza before heading back toward the Jacksonville Landing. From there, protesters went over the Main Street Bridge, causing police to shut the bridge down.
