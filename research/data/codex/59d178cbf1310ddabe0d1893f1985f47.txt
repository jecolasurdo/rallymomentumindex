(Photo by Trevor Stamp, Contributing Photographer) Show Caption of Expand More than 100 protesters gathered in Walnut on Monday afternoon to protest police brutality and the death, in police custody, of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The protest was held on Grand Avenue and Amar Road near Mt. San Antonio College and a shopping center. It looked like many protests throughout the country. Most of the protesters showed up wearing masks or face coverings. They held signs that said "Black Lives Matter” and "Silence is complicity”. Organizers led chants of "George Floyd” and "What do we want? Justice! When do we want it? Now!”. One man walked to the median of Amar Road at around 3:45 p.m. with a megaphone and a message to the protesters. "Our voice is powerful but it is not our only tool,” he said. "Vote. Talk to your city council. Talk to your families.” One organizer told protesters to leave after the eight minutes of silence at 4 p.m., so no protester would be in violation with the county's updated 5 p.m. curfew, which was given with 90 minutes notice. Protesters dropped to one knee at 4 p.m. in solidarity with Floyd. They remained kneeling for eight minutes. Chants of "take a knee” broke out during the memorial to encourage Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies to join the protesters. After no deputies joined them, chants of "Quit your job” started. Out here at Amar Road and Grand Avenue for a George Floyd and Black Lives Matter protest in Walnut. At least 100 people have gathered at the corners of the intersection and along Amar Road. Lots of chanting and signs. pic.twitter.com/bEfPGEefJD — Robert Gundran (@RobertGundran) June 1, 2020 Protest organizers told people to go home after 4 p.m., but a man with a megaphone and another man with a snare drum encouraged protesters to migrate down the road. Several walked down Grand Avenue to Valley Boulevard and stopped across the street from the Sheriff's Walnut/Diamond Bar station. One deputy later reminded the group it was 20 minutes to curfew and they would enforce it. Protesters gradually left in small groups. Most Mt. SAC employees are working off site. But an estimated 30 employees who are still working on campus were told to leave around 1 p,.m., according to Jill Dolan, director of public affairs at the college. The sheriff's Walnut/Diamond Bar station didn't require stores in the area to close, Lt. Mario Avola said on Monday morning before the protest. He said some of the stores decided to close, others opted to remain open. "We will monitor from a distance,” Avola said. pic.twitter.com/RasmV6OSYV — Robert Gundran (@RobertGundran) June 1, 2020 Authorities have charged former Officer Derek Michael Chauvin, 44, with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers were also fired. Protests have been held across the country since last week with several turning violent. The protests stem from the death of Floyd who police suspected of using a counterfeit $20 to buy items from Cup Foods on Chicago Avenue in Minneapolis. Chauvin placed his left knee in the area of Floyd's head and neck, according to the probable cause statement. Floyd said,” I can't breathe” multiple times, repeatedly said "Mama” and "please.” The officers told Floyd: "You are talking fine.” Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. Two minutes and 53 seconds of that after Floyd was already unresponsive, the statement said.
