They also marched to bring awareness to modern day lynching and systemic oppression against Black people. Over twenty armed Black Panther Party members and a few non-armed civilians participated in the pop-up protest against injustice.The Global Deputy Minister of Defense of the New Black Panther Party, General Rottweiler, organized and led the march/protest after an Atlanta activist Oscar Cain was shot in the back while running away from Police. Oscar Cain's killing and other Black people killed by local Police in recent years including Jimmy Atchinson, Shali Tilson, Nicholas Thomas, Anthony Hill, Jamarion Robinson, and Kathryn Johnston have ignited the Black Lives Matter Movement and reinvigorated solidarity amongst various social justice groups, including the New Black Panther Party Atlanta."We want Officers William Sauls, Steve Schreckengost, Steve O'Hare, Daniel Doyle, Kristopher Hutchens, Daniel Durand, Fayette County, Joshua Mauney, Eric Heinze, John Doe aka "TEZ,” & the other John Doe East Point be indicted and convicted for the murder of Jamarion Robinson.” — General RottweilerThe disproportionate killing of Black people by Police and high incarceration rates of Black people in Atlanta and across the nation continue to be a problem. For these reasons and others, activists and social justice groups all over the US are protesting injustice, economic oppression, militarized policing of Black/Brown and poor communities, racial profiling, targeting of people "living while Black”, and the school-to-prison pipeline. Families of the victims killed by Police are also saddened and frustrated because Police Officers are not held accountable for their crimes. Many Black people, organizations and communities are crying out for freedom and for the right to equitably thrive.The New Black Panther Party Atlanta, other local activists and groups stand in solidarity to protest oppression, White supremacy, and injustice. As the nation seems to be stifled in the progress for equality, equity, justice and peace, people of all races, ethnicities, creeds, and religions are standing up and speaking out against the hate that permeates in this country and around the world.The New Black Panther Party derives from the Black Panther Party movement of the 60's. This modern non-violent group continues to practice their 2nd amendment right, protect the Black community (people & property), protest economic oppression and racial inequities, and do community service projects.The New Black Panther Party today includes a diversity of individuals with varied backgrounds, beliefs, and values. People join the organization for a variety of reasons, but mostly because they believe in the liberation of Black people. General Rottweiler says, "I joined shortly after the George Zimmerman acquittal when I finally had enough of all the injustice in this country. I also joined to make a difference and help people.”The New Black Panther Party — Atlanta Chapter under the leadership of the Global Chairman Hashim Nzinga, helps the community by feeding the homeless, providing security, and training people to protect themselves. They help rescue people, free slaves, and help find missing children in the U.S. and around the world. They rescue people by boat during hurricanes and have weekly and monthly educational programs.The New Black Panther Party wants people to not judge or be afraid of them. They peacefully practice their 2nd amendment right, protest oppression, and protect protestors. They consciously educate, uplift, and help poor Black people and communities. They want people to not be ignorant and/or fear them, but to get to know them and the causes they stand for to liberate, secure, and save the lives of Black people.#BlackLivesMatter2 BlackLivesMatterBlack Panther PartyPolice BrutalityEconomic InequitySystemic Racism2 clapsWritten byThe Global Purpose ApproachFollowOur mission is to have a united world filled with appreciation, empathy, respect, peace, & love.
