They gathered at Red Arrow Park in downtown Milwaukee on Friday, August 29th to remember Dontre Hamilton who was shot and killed by a Milwaukee police officer. Dontre Hamilton Those rallying say they are shining a light on a sometimes "strained" relationship between police and the public. Throughout the demonstrations like the one on Friday and in previous weeks, people have been motivated to take part by different events. The Hamilton case is certainly one of those events. Hamilton, a mentally ill man, was shot and killed at Red Arrow Park on April 30th during an apparent "struggle" with a Milwaukee police officer. Members of the Hamilton family attended this latest rally. For months, the family has publicly asked Milwaukee police for information surrounding the shooting. Family members say it's taken the Milwaukee County District Attorney too long to make a judgment on the use of deadly force. Supporters also continue to ask for more oversight on law enforcement in the city, including advocating officers wearing chest-mounted cameras; something that's instituted at departments in other parts of the country. A group of people made a simple gesture during Friday's rally. This rally was different from the march held earlier this week. The difference -- supporters laid down, instead of marching. "Dontre Hamilton was lying down in the park when he was approached by the officers and eventually shot 14 times," said community organizer, Curtis Sails. The Hamilton family has been seeking information surrounding this investigation. Saying, it's taken the county district attorney too long to make a judgement on the use of deadly force. "This is where his blood sits. His blood is in this park, within this concrete so to come out here and see people laying on the ground it's a good feeling for the community," said Nathaniel Hamilton, Dontre's brother. The group laid down, and then got up, to talk about specific change. "It's not a simple answer, it's not a simple answer but I think there are some strategic things that need to be done to make moves toward justice in this city," said Sails. Members of this group are advocating officers wear cameras on their chest while on duty. Several departments across the country are already doing this. "That would help so there is a record. So it's on camera, there is a record and hopefully it would clear up some of the questions to what did happening on some of these instances," said Babette Grunow, an activist at the rally. A rally in Red Arrow Park, demonstrating the interconnecting parts of a community's unrest. Because dying is not complicated, but dealing with loss is. Nathaniel Hamilton says, they are not done. They will continue to demonstrate peacefully.

You are dead because of your own actions. Just a reminder you took a cops baton and hit him with it several times. So in return the cop shot you until the threat (you Mr Hamilton) was gone (dead). The late Mr Hamilton you got shot in the face because of what you did, your own action, you are the one to blame for your death. This is a money grab for the family, just animals.
