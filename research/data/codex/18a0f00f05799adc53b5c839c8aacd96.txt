(Photo by Ryan J. Degan) Hundreds of protesters braved scorching 100 degree heat and took to the streets of San Ramon on Wednesday, in a mass demonstration that condemned racism and police brutality both locally and across the county. The most recent Tri-Valley protest inspired by the killing of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis on Memorial Day, the non-violent demonstration shut down a large section of central San Ramon from 5 to 7:30 p.m. as protesters marched from Valley View Park, down Bollinger Canyon Road all the way to San Ramon City Hall where a rally was held.

"(Suburban residents) are often unaware of the issues; they are sometimes sheltered and are not aware of things that happen to us," said San Ramon resident Courtney Smith. "San Ramon is my safe place, so it's important for the people in my community to know what we go through on a daily basis." Smith did add however, that despite the prevalent issues in the region, the size and diverse makeup of the protests was an encouraging sight, saying: "I think to see all the different backgrounds and ethnicities, this is what our community is. We are not just one demographic, we are a whole lot of different people and this shows it right here. And I can't be proud enough to say I am from San Ramon because we do care too."

This is a peaceful protest and we are just going to try and go out there and show that we're angry and we're fighting for a good cause. Not in a violent way, but in a way that we are going to be heard and cause change," Keith Smith added. Several hundred residents participated in the march, which was met with cooperation from the San Ramon Police Department, who collaborated with organizers and sent officers in advance of the group, shutting down streets to motorists in order to ensure a safe event. Participants decried racism and police brutality, in a showing of support for the Black Lives Matter and Justice for George Floyd movements. (Photo by Ryan J. Degan) Marching down Bollinger Canyon Road, protesters chanted familiar sayings of the movement such as "No Justice, No Peace," and "Black Lives Matter," as well as chanting the names of Black Americans recently killed including Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery. Upon reaching the Bollinger Canyon Road-Canyon View Circle intersection, the procession took a knee for an eight-minute moment of silence, doing so in recognition of the amount of time Floyd suffocated while Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck. Afterward, the group continued on to San Ramon City Hall, where participants shared testimonials about life and issues of Black people in the San Ramon Valley, sang songs and performed live poetry.

From racist graffiti in schools to daily microaggressions and police profiling, rally testimonials highlighted that issues surrounding racism are still very much local issues. "I've experienced racism at Cal High the whole time I was there, and I don't think kids around here really understand it. So it's important to bring awareness to this community, just because it's a nicer area, I don't think (locals) really grasp the issues," Kayla M told DanvilleSanRamon.com. "They make light of it, they'll make jokes about it," added Kalen M. While these issues are very much relevant in the region, organizers did thank the San Ramon Police Chief Craig Stevens for his support during the City Hall rally.

Perrin addressed the crowd directly on Wednesday, saying: "There was a social media post and it said 'Zae, how are we gonna stop it?' It's called physics, the only way we stop it is with a force as strong if not stronger. I am proud to stand here and have all of you supporting me and supporting my family.

"I am proud that you are here to support, but go know your neighbors, go introduce yourself let them know who you are, let them know your pain, let them know your goals, let them know your love, because that's how we get the entire population down here standing for each other," he added. This was the third peaceful protest in the Tri-Valley, with the first occurring in Dublin on Monday, followed by one in Danville on Tuesday. There is one more planned Tri-Valley protest related to racism and the Black Lives Matter movement coming up, with Pleasanton residents having scheduled one for 2 p.m. on Friday in front of Amador Valley Community Park, 4301 Black Ave. Pleasanton protest organizers say they have been working with local police in order to ensure that protest is another one.

I think calling it a "mass demonstration" when there were less than two hundred people is a bit of an exaggeration though. That does not mean that people do not care but most people are respecting social distancing in these times and also do not need others to speak for them. I am curious who the organizers were since these events always need people to plan, organize, and speak to the audience. It turned out that many of the protests of the past year of two have been run by outsiders who were manipulating the participants for their own agenda. I hope this was not the case with this one.

The turnout was HUGE- Far MORE THAN 200 ppl. Families with young children, teens, young and old of ALL RACES attended peacefully. It was a powerful protest. All POC were given a chance to describe their many experiences of racial discrimination WITHIN our own community. The SRVPD worked actively with organizers to keep both the town and the protesters safety. They closed down street for the duration of the March. Officers were friendly, helpful and wearing normal uniforms and I did not see any hint of riot gear. All protesters calmly and peacefully dispersed in accordance with the curfew without incident and were later thanked by the SRVPD via Twitter for keeping the protest peaceful. And us protesters sent messages of gratitude to the PD. For those complaining about the protests or those of you huddled in your boarded up model homes clutching your guns- you can stand down. The protesters yesterday were not outsiders trying to torch your Beamer. We are your neighbors, fellow community members and quite possibly your own children or grandchildren.

Black suspects fatally shot were significantly more likely to have a deadly weapon with them than white suspects, yet more white suspects were killed. Last year, there were a total of 10 people in the U.S. in which unarmed black people were fatally shot by the police. During President Obama's 2015 term, 38 unarmed blacks were killed by police. Overall, during Trump presidency, the number of unarmed blacks killed by police has drastically dropped. 48 police officers will killed in line of duty last year. Blacks are 700 more time likely killed by people they know then police officers. Facts.

So if the involvement of blacks with law and order accounts for over 50% then the lower number being shot means proportionately more whites get shot. I am not white. I am an immigrant POC. There is definitely a problem in the black community but its has very little to do with cops. There are bad cops everywhere. The cops in my country of origin were horrible and majority of them bad apples. The cop who murdered Floyd needs to be put in jail and punished. I dont think anyone denies that. Which is why there has been overwhelming support for the protests. At the same time the looters and rioters taking advantage of the situation should also be punished. 3 cops and 1 ex cop, all of them black were killed by rioters. Their life does not matter to BLM because it does not fit their poilitical narrative!

Blacks only are around 12+/-% of the US population." Web Link Go to page 12 table 7, demographics data for violent crimes in America from 1980 to 2008. 52.8% of the offenders are black. So it would make sense that the number of deaths by cops should be more or less equal since the offenders are equally divided. But the data shows that whites get killed lot more by cops even though they equally represent violent crimes. I know it goes against your political narrative. But those are the facts.

I protested peacefully in memory of my fellow CHS classmate. We graduated from CHS together and returned to San Ramon to raise our families at roughly the same time. We compared our post-return experience with local law enforcement. He was pulled over by local police 35+ times in a span of 20 years compared to my ONCE, but I'm sure it had nothing to do with the difference in the color of our skin. Very sad for my community and my country. To have such privilege and still make a deliberate choice to live in ignorance and fear - in a prison of your own construction - is a true crime against humanity.
