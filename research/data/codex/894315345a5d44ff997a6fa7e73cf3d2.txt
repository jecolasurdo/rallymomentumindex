A couple of supporters stood at the courthouse in support. They joined together in prayer with the women and child protesting. Rachel Adams of Good Hope said she was just there to offer support. Darrell Everidge of Darrell Everidge Productions covered the protest and shared his Youtube below. "We have black family members and my brother is police officer and he is heartbroken,” an emotional Adams said. "He has served this country in the army and he serves every day. He is down in Atlanta right now. And it is so hard for him because he does not want the police to be looked at based on the horrible acts that continue to happen. So change has to happen. And I guess change is only going to happen by people speaking up, by people talking and seriously by the word of God. Because I have so much anger and hurt for these people – and I don't know what they're going through.” Photo credit: Sharon Swanepoel Monroe Police Chief R.V. Watts and other members of the Monroe Police Department were visible on the streets, but nobody interfered with the small group that was protesting. Watts said they support anybody's right to peaceful protest. "Everybody hates what happened. We support their right to protest it,” Watts said.
