(0:47)FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmailSep 24, 2017ESPN.com staffFacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerPinterestEmailprintPresident Donald Trump on Friday criticized NFL players who lodge pregame protests, saying in a speech in Alabama that he wished those players would be released. He also encouraged fans who are offended to walk out of stadiums. Several players and coaches reacted strongly to Trump on social media, and in terms of protests, the NFL is expecting a "mixed bag today, on a team-by-team basis," a senior NFL official told ESPN's Sal Paolantonio on Sunday.Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started the pregame protest of racial oppression and inequality in the United States last season by sitting during the national anthem before a preseason game, then kneeling during the anthem throughout the season.Previous protests this season: Week 2 | Week 1 | PreseasonHere are the players who protested in Week 3 (most recent updates first):Dallas Cowboys: The Cowboys briefly took a knee before a giant American flag was unfurled that covered almost the entire field before the Cowboys' game Monday night against the Cardinals. They lined up alongside the northern goal line of the end zone during the national anthem, and players linked arms. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones and Cowboys coaches participated in both taking a knee and linking arms with players. -- Todd ArcherArizona Cardinals: The Cardinals lined up alongside the southern goal line of the end zone during the national anthem on Monday night. Some players linked arms. Cardinals president Michael Bidwill was standing between Patrick Peterson and Larry Fitzgerald, who was standing to the right of coach Bruce Arians. -- Josh WeinfussOakland Raiders: Most of the Raiders remained seated or took a knee during the national anthem prior to Sunday night's game at Washington, including the entire offensive line, which is comprised of all minority players and is the lone all-black starting unit in the NFL, and the defensive line. Players who stood interlocked arms, as did coach Jack Del Rio, and quarterback Derek Carr appeared to pray while looking skyward and standing. -- Paul GutierrezWashington Redskins: Owner Dan Snyder linked arms with corners Bashaud Breeland and Josh Norman during the national anthem. The entire team linked arms, but seven players opted to take a knee: receivers Jamison Crowder, Josh Doctson and Brian Quick; tight ends Niles Paul and Jordan Reed; and linebackers Ryan Anderson and Chris Carter. In the first two game the Redskins had stood in line during the anthem. The team released a statement after the anthem: "Football has always served as the great unifier, bringing people together to celebrate the values of courage, commitment and achievement. We are proud of the players, coaches and fans of the Washington Redskins for all that they have done to improve the lives of others in neighborhoods all across our region. We are also grateful for the sacrifices made by the brave men and women of our armed forces that have provided us the freedom to play football. In that great tradition, the Washington Redskins will work to address divisions and bring unity, civility and respect to our greater community.” -- John KeimSeattle Seahawks: The Seahawks did not participate in the national anthem before their game against the Titans. Players released this statement: "As a team, we have decided we will not participate in the national anthem. We will not stand for the injustice that has plagued people of color in this country. Out of love for our country and in honor of the sacrifices made on our behalf, we unite to oppose those that would deny our most basic freedoms. We remain committed in continuing to work towards equality and justice for all."In his pregame radio interview with Jen Mueller of Root Sports Northwest, Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said the message of the team not coming onto the field for the national anthem was unity. "We're just staying together. We're staying together,” Carroll said. "This is a day that we all want to make sure that we're together and celebrating the opportunity to play this game together in the best way we can possible.” -- Brady HendersonESPNNo players on either team's sideline for the national anthem ahead of the Seahawks-Titans game at Nissan Stadium.Brady Henderson, ESPN agoTennessee Titans: The Titans decided to remain in the locker room during the national anthem ahead of their game with the Seahawks. "As a team, we wanted to be unified in our actions today,” the Titans said in a statement. "The players jointly decided this was the best course of action. Our commitment to the military and our community is resolute and the absence of our team for the national anthem shouldn't be misconstrued as unpatriotic.” -- Cameron WolfeESPN Staff WriterNoticeable boos from home fans as Titans came on field locking arms after anthem was finished. Five team captains: Marcus Mariota, Jurrell Casey, Wesley Woodyard, Delanie Walker, Brian Orakpo led the way.Cameron Wolfe, ESPN Staff Writer agoHere are wide receiver Rishard Matthews' pregame cleats:ESPN Staff WriterThese are the cleats that Titans WR Rishard Matthews will wear in today's game vs. Seahawks. They say 'We are One' and 'We all bleed the same,' as a message against racial inequality in this country and Donald Trump's verbal attack against the NFL and its players who choose to protest. Matthews, a strong supporter of the military, told me last month: "We're men that play football. We're not just football players."Cameron Wolfe, ESPN Staff Writer agoCincinnati Bengals: All of the Bengals' players and coaches stood for the national anthem with their arms linked before the game against the Packers. The only notable exceptions were Kevin Huber, Randy Bullock, Cedric Ogbuehi, T.J. Johnson and Russell Bodine, who stood with their hands over their hearts. Nobody kneeled. No Bengals player has kneeled during the national anthem since the protests began last year. Tyler Eifert, who has been vocal about standing for the anthem, did not travel to this game because of an injury. The Bengals released this statement after the players linked arms: "Football and politics don't mix easily. Fans come to NFL games to watch great competition on the playing field and that's where our focus should be. -- Katherine TerrellGreen Bay Packers: The Packers linked arms in two groups on their sideline during the anthem before the game against the Bengals, but three players sat on the bench: tight ends Lance Kendricks and Martellus Bennett and cornerback Kevin King. Bennett previously had stood with his fist raised in the past two games. -- Rob DemovskyKansas City Chiefs: Many Chiefs protested the national anthem by sitting before the game against the Chargers. I counted 11 players standing for the anthem along the sideline, where the team usually gathers. Some players, including quarterbacks Alex Smith and Patrick Mahomes, stood, but behind the bench. Among players who didn't stand: tight end Travis Kelce, linebacker Justin Houston, wide receiver Tyreek Hill and running back Kareem Hunt. -- Adam TeicherLos Angeles Chargers: Chargers players Brandon Mebane, Damion Square and Darius Philon sat, while Tenny Palepoi and Chris McCain knelt during the national anthem before the game against the Chiefs. The rest of the Chargers players and coaches, including owner Dean Spanos and general manager Tom Telesco, locked arm in arm. "I have tremendous respect for our flag and the men and women who defend it,” Spanos said in a prepared statement. "Ours is the greatest nation in the world, one in which people are able to speak freely and stand up publicly for their beliefs. Our players, as do all Americans, have every right to speak their mind and from their heart. It was an honor to join them on the field today.” -- Eric D. WilliamsESPN Senior WriterThe Chargers locking arms during the national anthem. Melvin Ingram took a knee.

Fans booed the Lions as they protested. Eight players, including Ameer Abdullah, Tahir Whitehead and most of the defensive line, kneeled and linked arms. Eric Ebron stood alone, away from his teammates, in the back. Anthem singer Rico LaVelle, at the end of the anthem, took a knee and raised his fist. -- Michael RothsteinNew Orleans Saints: Running backs Adrian Peterson, Mark Ingram and Alvin Kamara were among a group of 10 players who sat on the bench during the national anthem for the first time Sunday at Carolina.

Punter Thomas Morstead, cornerback Marshon Lattimore, linebacker Craig Robertson and tight end Coby Fleener stood next to the sitting players, with their arms on the players' shoulders. No Saints had sat or knelt during the anthem before -- although they did organize a teamwide display of unity and hand-holding with the Falcons after the anthem on a Monday Night Football game last season. Quarterback Drew Brees came out strongly last year saying he disagreed with Colin Kaepernick's form of protest, though he didn't disagree with his message. -- Mike TriplettAtlanta Falcons: Falcons owner Arthur Blank stood on the sideline with arms locked along with wide receiver Julio Jones and running back Devonta Freeman during Sunday's national anthem before the game against the Lions.

This is the first time that a Colts player took a knee during the national anthem since cornerback Antonio Cromartie did so in London in Week 4 last season. -- Mike WellsMinnesota Vikings: A host of Vikings were joined by general manager Rick Spielman and owners Mark and Zygi Wilf on the sideline and linked arms during the national anthem before the game against the Bucs. Not all Vikings participated in the display, including members of the offensive line, Dalvin Cook, Latavius Murray and C.J. Ham.

Running back Jerick McKinnon stood with his arms around Vikings special-teams coach Mike Priefer and trainer Eric Sugarman. -- Courtney CroninHouston Texans: During the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Patriots, Texans players stood side by side and linked arms.
