The number protesters increased after sundown along West Florissant Avenue, scene of nightly protests -- often tense and sometimes violent -- since Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson fatally shot Michael Brown, 18, on Aug. 9. The shooting scene, a street in the Canfield Green apartments, is just off West Florissant, and a three-block stretch of that suburban commercial route has been the place of turmoil for nearly two weeks.Estimates were of about 150 protesters, who marched back and forth along the sidewalks. Police in small clusters watched, or stood guard in front of businesses. The protests was smaller than previous nights and continued a trend since Monday night, the last time police officers in riot gear fired tear gas into unruly mobs.So far, the only tense moment Thursday night was about 10:40 p.m., when a motorist on West Florissant stopped and began exhorting the crowd. Police tried to stop him, but he drove off, heading south. Officers stopped him near Lucas and Hunt Road. As of roughly 11 p.m., at least five people have been arrested on charges of failure to disperse, the standard charge filed from West Florissant. Police said they arrested people who tried to agitate the crowd and wouldn't stop when warned. Jay Nixon said he would withdraw the small Missouri National Guard unit that has been guarding the "unified command" headquarters at the Westfall shopping center, formerly Northland. Nixon sent in the unit on Monday.But a few soldiers and a humvee remained on duty Thursday night near the gaggle of TV satellite trucks. The big networks remain on the story, but the number of TV trucks was about 25 percent smaller than a few nights before.On West Florissant, a lone television photographer walked alongside a small band of protesters chanting, "Hands up, don't shoot." Two nights ago, a dozen crews might have tagged along.Mel Adou of St. Louis, a native of Ivory Coast, visited the memorial of teddy bears and candles at the shooting scene and chatted with Stan De Saint Hippolyte, Washington correspondent for the TV network France 24. De Saint Hippolyte flew into town Tuesday, but his crew was packing to go. "We arrived too late," he said.Adou said he had needed to see the place. "I shed a few tears when I first got here, picturing Mike Brown laying in the street," he said.Four people placed roses along Canfield Drive. They wouldn't give their names, just roses.The high temperature Thursday was 96 degrees, the third-hottest day in an otherwise mild summer, and was stuck at 87 at 11 p.m. The forecast is for temperatures near 100 today through the weekend, then breaking moderately. Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald S. Johnson, commander of the combined law enforcement effort, said he believed there were two reasons for reduced tensions -- announcement that the St. Louis County grand jury began reviewing the case on Wednesday, and the visit on that same day of U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder. "I think it shows that the process has begun, and people know the President is watching," Johnson said.After chatting with members of the Zainabiya mosque in north county, Johnson said, "At least this has shown that we need to be talking together all the time, all the races." Two protesters also welcomed the grand jury. "At least the process has started and I think that allowed people to take a breath." His friend, Michelle Seddins, agreed to a point: It won't really be solved until (officer Wilson) is behind bars. This is not something that can be swept under the rug."-- Joe Holleman and Koran Addo 9 p.m. • • • U.S. legislators meet with defense secretaryReps. William Lacy Clay, D-St. Louis and Emanuel Cleaver, D-Kansas City, met at the Pentagon Thursday with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel to talk about what the congressmen called "urgent concerns about the militarization of local law enforcement agencies through a Pentagon program to give surplus military equipment to local police. The so-called 1033 program has come under scrutiny during police response to demonstrations, looting and violence in the wake of the shooting death of Michael Brown, 18, by Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. "We have asked the secretary to review the program and to respond with his recommendations quickly," said a joint statement issued by Clay and Cleaver."The discussion allowed us to share our objections, and those of our constituents, who are seeking a vigorous review of the existing 1033 program and some important changes to ensure public safety and the preservation of fundamental constitutional rights," the statement read.The statement concluded: "If there is any good that can come out of the tragedy in Ferguson, Mo., our hope is that this effort will spur a national discussion about how to achieve a fundamental shift in local law enforcement, away from military-style responses, and towards a more community-based policy.” The House of Representatives in June defeated by a 355-62 vote an attempt to prohibit the Pentagon from transferring to local police various military equipment, including armored vehicles, grenade launchers, silencers, toxicological agents and ballistic missiles. "These weapons have no place on our streets regardless of who may be deploying them," said the sponsor, Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., before the June 19 vote.Clay and Cleaver both voted against the Grayson amendment. Clay said earlier this week that "over 350 members of Congress voted against Mr. Grayson's amendment."I don't regret the vote," Clay said, "But I strongly object to a tactical police unit pointing military sniper rifles and automatic weapons at my unarmed constituents who were peacefully exercising their constitutional rights."— Chuck Raasch, 8:05 p.m. • • • Canadian journalist was one of those arrested TuesdayA Canadian television journalist was among several other journalists arrested Tuesday night in Ferguson, according to the Canadian network CTV news. Tom Walters, CTV's Los Angeles Bureau Chief, was arrested under the order of Capt. Ronald S. Johnson of the Missouri Highway Patrol. Walters reported that Tuesday night, before the last demonstrator had left, police insisted media leave first. Walters approached Johnson and asked why. "Captain Johnson, what's the reason for ordering the media out?” he asked as Johnson walked on the street with other officers. "Arrest him, arrest him,” Johnson can be seen saying. "I just asked a question!” Walters said over and over as other officers detained him. • • • More than 200 arrests since Aug. 10, but only seven overnight WednesdaySt. Louis County Police said officers arrested seven people Wednesday night and early Thursday in Ferguson, where events were considerably quieter. The department also reported Thursday that it had logged 204 arrests since Aug. 10, when violence broke out on West Florissant Avenue. On that night, the QuikTrip at 9240 West Florissant was looted and burned.Overwhelmingly, the charges filed were refusal to disperse during the almost nightly conflicts and rioting. And most of those arrested are from North St. Louis County and St. Louis city, although 29 are from cities far away, including San Francisco, Austin, Tex., and Westport, Conn. Twenty-two of the out-of-town protesters were arrested Monday night or early Tuesday, one of the tension-filled nights when police in riot gear fired tear gas at unruly crowds.The report says those arrested include 58 from St. Louis city and about 70 from the north county area, including seven from Ferguson itself and 23 from Jennings, its neighbor to the east.Other charges filed include unlawful use of a weapon, receiving stolen property, burglary and one case of careless driving. — Staff, 6 p.m. • • • Quiet day in Ferguson after quiet night of protestsThere was little activity in Ferguson this morning after a quiet night of protests that wrapped up earlier than others since the shooting of Michael Brown on Aug. 9.Watchful officers in police cars were stationed along West Florissant Avenue, the main drag for protests, but there wasn't much for them to watch.Early this morning, some protesters who had stayed up all night drank coffee as they hung out in an area approved for gatherings by authorities.At midday, some got meals at Red's Barbecue, at West Florissant and Canfield Drive, near where Brown was shot by Ferguson Officer Darren Wilson. The St. Louis County NAACP and St. Louis County Councilman Steve Stenger, the Democrat candidate for county executive who defeated current County Executive Charlie Dooley in a primary election earlier this month, teamed up to provide care packages for residents of nearby apartments. Bags included food, diapers and other items, many donated by Save-A-Lot. Organizers said they wanted to help people who were having trouble getting in and out of the neighborhood to get necessities during the protests, and families who needed food assistance because the start of the school year has been delayed for some students who receive free lunch at school. Meanwhile, a group calling itself "The Justice for Michael Brown Leadership Coalition" gathered outside the County Justice Center Thursday morning to deliver an online petition seeking the removal of St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch from the case. State Sen. Jamilah Nasheed, D-St. Louis, spoke to a rally of about 50 people before delivering the petitions in the building, where McCulloch works. She said the petition has 70,000 signatures."Those signatures are coming from everywhere, throughout this country and worldwide," she said. "People have made a statement that they have no confidence in (McCulloch's) ability to be fair and impartial... They don't think he will do the right thing." McCulloch said he has no conflict of interest and won't recuse himself. He says his office will be presenting all of the evidence to a grand jury through mid-October.McCulloch said his critics should direct their pleas to Gov. Jay Nixon, who has the power to replace McCulloch now that Nixon has declared a state of emergency in the Ferguson matter. McCulloch has blasted the governor for not taking a decisive stand on the issue. On KMOX Radio Thursday afternoon, Nixon was asked again if he will remove McCulloch. "No," the governor said.McCulloch released a statement at midday reiteraring that he had no plans to step down. "I have a responsibility to the family of Michael Brown, the people of Ferguson and the entire community," McCulloch said in a four-paragraph statement in all capital letters. He said Nixon can remove him and, while he thinks that would be a mistake, directed his detractors to petition the governor. "The governor must settle this issue now," McCulloch's statement said. "To leave this issue unresolved now leaves the possibility of exercising this power at a later date which will cause a significant and unwarranted delay in the resoloution of the investigation and resolution of the case."The family of Michael Brown deserves an answer, the people of Ferguson deserve an answer and the people of the entire area deserve an answer."Read more about the sparring over McCulloch's role here. - Denise Hollinshed and Kim Bell, noon Thursday • • • Plans set for Michael Brown funeral The funeral for Michael Brown is scheduled for Monday at a St. Louis church.The Austin A. Layne Mortuary, which is handling arrangements, says the funeral is set for 10 a.m. at Friendly Temple Missionary Baptist Church, 5515 Martin Luther King Drive.Brown's uncle, the Rev. Charles Ewing, will deliver the eulogy, and the Rev. Al Sharpton will also speak.U.S. Rep. William Lacy Clay, D-Mo., has been asked by Brown's family to speak at Brown's funeral, said Clay spokesman Steven Engelhardt. Clay has also invited members of the Congressional Black Caucus to attend. Brown, 18, will be buried at St. Peter's Cemetery in St. Louis County.-Staff and wire, 10 p.m. Wednesday with updates• • • Few arrests as protests in Ferguson stay small and peacefulSix arrests were made by officers patrolling the streets of Ferguson late Wednesday and early today, Missouri Highway Patrol Capt. Ronald S. Johnson said.Speaking at a brief press conference at 1:30 a.m., Johnson said the 11th night of protests was fairly calm although an officer was hit by a bottle at one point. He said the officer was not injured. Johnson credited the officers as well as the "law-abiding men and women and teenagers of Ferguson" and the large contingent of clergy and church elders who came to the streets Wednesday night for keeping the protest in check.He also said the protesters were a quieter group. "We didn't have as many of the agitators," Johnson said.He said no fires were set, no one was shot and no guns were confiscated. The officers did not use smoke, tear gas or pepper spray on anyone, unlike in some past nights when the protests over the shooting death of Michael Brown by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson turned violent. Johnson did not detail the charges in all of the arrests, but he said some were for failure to disperse. Johnson, who is leading the security contingent, also credited the visit on Wednesday by Attorney General Eric Holder for helping lessen the tension on the streets. He said he believed the visit "let the community know their voices were heard."Read more about Holder's visit here.Earlier in the night, there was a tense moment when a pair of protesters supporting Wilson joined the throng of protesters demanding justice for Brown. The mood of some in the crowd turned ugly. The man and woman showed up at the protests shortly after 8 p.m. carrying signs of support for Wilson. Many in the crowd shouted at them but took no other action. Rain started falling about 8:30 p.m. — just as tensions peaked. Many protesters took shelter under store awnings. One of the pro-Michael Brown protesters said of the pair: "They're trying to incite a riot."Police evacuated the pro-Wilson demonstrators from the scene for their own safety. The protesters declined to give their names. As the rain eased after several minutes, protesters returned to West Florissant and chanted, "We're young, we're strong, we're marching all night long." Shortly before 9 p.m, about 125 protesters were gathered — a number that in the past has grown as the hour gets later. But the streets of Ferguson were nearly cleared out by early Thursday as people headed home after a night unmarred by tear gas or violence.By 12:15 a.m., there were two or three sets of two or three protesters doing the loop on West Florissant Avenue. And police officers on Wednesday night put helmets on only once, and only briefly. The helmets on past nights have sent a signal to the crowd that things were escalating. Aside from the tense moment with the Wilson supporters and the pro-Brown contingent, the crowd was one of the smallest and best behaved since the protests began. Police officers remained hopeful early Thursday that the calm would last into the weekend. About 100 St. Louis area clergy members wore bright orange "Clergy United" T-shirts as they walked with protesters. They made up at least half the crowd and got much of the credit for keeping the night calm. "When things heat up, we don't mind jumping into the middle of the fuss because we know who watches us," said Pastor Doug Hollis.Protesters also counseled each other to stay civil and avoid giving police officers a reason to use tear gas — which was avoided Tuesday night and again on Wednesday night. - Steve Giegerich, Lilly Fowler, and Nicholas J.C. Pistor, 1:50 a.m. Thursday• • • House speaker calls for special prosecutor during low-key stop in FergusonMissouri House Speaker Tim Jones, R-Eureka, visited the spot where Brown was killed and spoke to Ferguson residents and reporters on Wednesday. Jones backed the call for replacing St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch and criticized Gov. Jay Nixon for having been "all over the map” in the 11 days since Brown was killed."When you have that many people asking (for a special prosecutor), the best thing to me is to avoid the appearance of impropriety ... and appoint a special prosecutor,” Jones told reporters. A regular critic of Nixon in Jefferson City, Jones said the governor should have gotten involved in the case sooner than he did. "This is the first time an incident of this kind has occurred in this state,” Jones said. In the early days, Jones said, "He himself was not very engaged at all.”Jones said he listened to residents' concerns. "A lot of people still have a lot of raw emotions and are concerned,” he said. "They are concerned about justice being truly served.” - Lisa Brown, 7 p.m. Wednesday• • • Fundraising site for officer raises more than $97,000A fundraising site created to support Officer Darren Wilson had raised more than $97,000 as of 9 p.m Wednesday.

The cost? $10. Some of the protesters discussed plans to march to the Ferguson Police Department, but that plan has fizzled for several nights once they realize the police department is four miles away.- Steve Giegerich, 8:15 p.m Wednesday• • • Archbishop Carlson celebrates special Mass for Brown's family, an end to racismAt 5 p.m. Wednesday, about 500 worshippers gathered at the St. Louis Cathedral Basilica in Lindell Boulevard to pray for Michael Brown and his family. Archbishop Robert Carlson celebrated the Mass. Among those attending was Mayor Francis Slay. Said Carlson, "We must examine the tragic events taking place in the St. Louis area, seek to understand 'Why?' and work toward dismantling systemic racism. Until the causes are addressed and rectified, there will be no change.”Carlson said the archdiocese would reestablish a human rights commission and work to provide more school scholarships.Among the concelebrants was Rev. Robert "Rosy” Rosebrough, pastor of Blessed Teresa of Calcutta parish in Ferguson. "Beneath the surface of Michael Brown's death are a lot of issues,” Rosebrough said. Prayer cards handed out included a special appeal to God: "May you console Michael Brown's family with your healing grace, and walk with the family of the policeman involved in the shooting.” Said Slay, "The archbishop invoked St Louis' bravest Catholic moments to call for a new activism. I thought his tone was both inspiring and very practical." - Lilly Fowler, 8 p.m. WednesdayClergy and others march to Justice CenterShortly before 7 p.m. Wednesday, about 100 people marched from Clayton High School eight blocks to the Justice Center for a rally organized by a clergy group. It called for replacement of St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch with a special prosecutor, "an expedited grand jury hearing to indict Officer Darren Wilson" and an investigation into racial profiling. A group of about 90 clergy members from several faiths called Clergy for a Moral Missouri march in protest from Clayton High School to the Buzz Westfall Justice Center in Clayton on August 20, 2014, to emphasize a list of demands for St. Louis County Prosecutor Robert McCulloch regarding the handling of the shooting death of unarmed teenager Michael Brown by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson. Photo by Christian Gooden, cgooden@post-dispatch.com Participants sang and carried signs saying, "Black lives matter," and "Taser, then talk." A few officers stood outside the Justice Center when the marchers arrived.The Rev. Julie Taylor, a minister at Emerson Unitarian Universalist Church in Ellisville, said she had been to Ferguson and believed that clergy there had reduced tensions and save lives. "We uphold the principle that every life has inherent worth and dignity." Taylor said. "Talk is talk, but I need to put my body on the line, too."The Rev. Chuck Tobin of Kansas City, a retired Catholic priest, said he visited Ferguson Wednesday."I'm here for solidarity more than anything and to listen what's going on with the people," Tobin said. "Until you walk it, you really don't get a feel for it." - Valerie Schremp Hahn, 8 p.m. Wednesday• • •City releases videotape showing Darren Wilson The city of Ferguson released a videotape Wednesday that showed Officer Darren Wilson being commended for outstanding police work.The videotape, taken at a city council meeting in February, marked the first time the city confirmed any kind of image of Wilson, who has not been seen since the Aug. 9 shooting.
