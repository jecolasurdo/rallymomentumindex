According to fans, some members of the team have been kneeling for several weeks at games. The high schoolers have joined in protest of police violence. San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started the trend by not standing during the national anthem to protest brutality and racial injustice. Like it or not, the protests have taken hold in the minds of young people and the Aurora Public School System is standing behind its players. "Aurora Public Schools staff members respect the right of our students to protest in a peaceful manner," the district said in a statement. "We are using this opportunity as a teachable moment and a catalyst for meaningful dialogue.” However, in the stands, not all agree with the protest. "To me, it's disrespectful. They don't really know what they're doing," Barb Albrecht said. "I had a lot of family during the second world war and I lost an uncle. He was killed in the Normandy invasion." Albrecht said the students at the school have had it pretty easy and they don't understand the sacrifice that goes on when someone is at war. Others think the protest is justified and are proud the students are doing something proactive. "I think it's great for them to take a kneel down. Let the world know that this is something we need to handle as a people. This is something that needs to be done. No if ands or buts about it," Marquis Cox said. "Regardless of race or color, we need them to voice their opinions. We need them to learn at an early age what we learn late."
