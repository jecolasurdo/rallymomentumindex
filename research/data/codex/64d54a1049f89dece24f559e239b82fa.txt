He told the small crowd: "We are talking about innocent lives that are being taken constantly and they never, never are being held accountable for the crimes they are committing.” While Thursday's protest and other events been in the works for some time, they are coinciding with a tragic event – the killing of a New York City police officer, Randolph Holder, in the line of duty on Tuesday night. Holder, a decorated five-year veteran of the department, was shot in the head after a chase. A 30-year-old man with a history of arrests has been charged with murder.

But "that murder does not discount the hundreds of deaths that we are seeing and continuing to see and the lack of any indictments and the lack of any justice and that's why I'm here today,” she said. Those who spoke at the rally included family members of people killed in interactions with police all over the country, both recent deaths like that of Akai Gurley in November 2014 and others going back years, like Heyward's. The RiseUpOctober events were the brainchild of activist Carl Dix and academic Cornel West, and are scheduled to culminate on Saturday with a march in Manhattan. Recent deaths at police hands have spurred protests nationwide over police use of force. "We are talking about something that is widespread and intense when we talk about losing their lives at the hands of law enforcement,” Dix said on Thursday.
