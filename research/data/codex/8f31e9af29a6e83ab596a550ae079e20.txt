Cleveland police blocked side streets, intersections and freeway exit ramps to allow the protesters to pass.It was a peaceful protest that started at the Cudell Recreation Center in mid-afternoon. Supporters of the Rice family left stuffed animals, coloring books and at least one wrapped Christmas present in the gazebo where the shooting occurred.At about 4:30 p.m., demonstrators announced they were starting their march. As they walked, they shouted various chants, including, "If killer cops walk the streets, so do we."They also shouted,"Hey, Hey, ho, ho, these killer cops have got to go," and, "If we march today, maybe a kid doesn't die tomorrow."Every so often, bystanders yelled out support to the demonstrators.On Lorain Avenue, the weather turned rainy, and everyone was drenched in seconds. The protesters only shouted louder.Police sirens wailed and blue and red lights flashed. Police cruisers took up the rear of the protest and raced ahead to block intersections.On West 130th, residents watched the march from their front porches. For some it was business as usual, as they dragged garbage cans to the curb for pickup.Marchers stopped at the police station, where officers locked the lobby. Police said the station was open, but residents said they tried to report a car accident and other incidents, but could not get inside.One protester, Terry Tolefree, yelled to police, "if you're that scared of a 12-year- old, don't be a cop."A man from the neighborhood screamed profanities at protesters. He said he lives there and objected to their presence. The protesters said they live there, too. A police officer guided the man away.As the protest wound down, someone served hot chocolate and chili to the demonstrators, who announced there would other protests Tuesday, starting at noon at East 55th Street and Union Avenue and at 3 p.m. at the Justice Center.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).Â© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
