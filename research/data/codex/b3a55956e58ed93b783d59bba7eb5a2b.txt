Mike Lowe, an organizer with SATX4, addressed the group of several dozen as they stood in front of the Confederate statue in Travis Park, encouraging them to attend the Citizens to be Heard meeting Wednesday at City Hall to voice concern over a lack of accountability in the contract drafted between the city and the San Antonio Police Officers Association. "They are passing a contract void of any accountability,” Lowe said. "They wanna pass it now and talk later and that's not going to fly.” The San Antonio Police Officers Association approved the terms of the new collective-bargaining agreement Thursday. The City Council is expected to vote next month on the terms of the agreement. Local activists say the contract blocks accountability by disqualifying complaints, preventing officers from being interrogated immediately after an incident, and gives officers access to information that civilians do not get. People against the contract said it prevents the release of information on past misconduct, thus limiting disciplinary consequences. "You're setting it up to always protect the officers,” activist Mary Kay Johnson said. "We want to make sure San Antonio becomes proactive and not reactive.” "This contract allows that loophole when it comes to officer statements and how they're interrogated,” Lowe said. Lowe said that the city needs to have accountability of the SAPD to handle incidents such as the death of Antronie Scott, who was fatally shot in February when officer John Lee mistook a cell phone in his hand for a gun. Rey Saldaña, Lowe said, has been the only city councilman to voice the same concerns held by the protesters Saturday. Johnson addressed the group of several dozen activists who gathered just before their march. "The most troubling things is just how laid back they are about how serious things can get so quickly,” she said. Johnson said she moved to San Antonio from Chicago when she felt it was no longer safe to raise her 2-year-old son. Johnson responded to SAPOA President Mike Helle who was quoted in a Texas Public Radio segment, saying that Black Lives Matters did not represent the voice of the community, and that they were more similar to an anarchist group. "I don't see that here. I see concerned citizens,” Johnson said. "Saying Black Lives Matters is like the KKK lets me know you are not listening to community that is so unified.” After the talk, the protesters walked past the Majestic Theater, the Alamo Plaza, and through River Center Mall, monitored by several bike patrol officers. The response from observers varied from shouts of support with a fist held high while others crumpled the pamplets they were handing out and yelled "All Lives Matter!” jbeltran@express-news.net Twitter: @JBfromSA Most Popular 1 Man left bloodied after defending woman from racist tirade at San Antonio gym 2 Fort Hood investigating sexual harassment against Vanessa Guillen 3 Authorities in Florida arrest man who allegedly shot eight people at San Antonio bar 4 Texas students will return to school campuses this fall, Gov.
