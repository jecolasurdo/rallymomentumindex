Angry clashes broke out on Friday evening after protesters blocked part of Kingsland Road and set mattresses alight.Some of the protestors carried Black Lives Matter placards. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is investigating his death.

That death is also being investigated by the police watchdog.Police warned that anyone using Saturday's events "as an excuse to commit crime" would be "dealt with robustly".

Scores of missiles were later launched at police as they attempted to disperse the group.Police in Hackney tweeted: "Officers have been subjected to abuse and violence. Whatever the frustrations, this is patently not what the family of Rashan Charles wanted."

He was taken to an east London police station where he remains in custody. The Met said a police officer injured his eye and a member of the public was knocked off his bike and assaulted as he tried to pass through the protest. Det Supt Claire Crawley, from Hackney Borough, said: "The disorder of last night was separate from the peaceful protest at Stoke Newington Police Station that was held earlier that day."She added: "We will always support the right to lawful protest but behaviour such as that seen last night cannot be tolerated."One man who was at the demonstration told the BBC the protesters were "angry and confused" because they were "not being represented". He suggested young people were "living in fear", adding they "don't understand how to live, how to make money, how to work for what they want", with some "forced into" situations such as selling drugs or carrying knives. Image copyright PA Image caption Protesters also gathered outside Stoke Newington police station on Monday Shadow home secretary and Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP Diane Abbott said: "The anger and upset at the death of Rashan Charles is understandable."But Rashan's family have explicitly spoken out against hostile actions. We must respect their wishes and any protests must be peaceful."Philip Glanville, the mayor of Hackney, said the community intended to hold peaceful protests, but some people from outside the borough wanted to "engage in vandalism and unrest"."What we've tried to do all week is separate the two groups, to recognise the rawness of the anger out in the community," he said.Mr Glanville said he did not think there was a problem between the police and the community, as a lot of work had been carried out in the area following the 2011 riots.
