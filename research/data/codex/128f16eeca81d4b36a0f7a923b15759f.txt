The students exited OPRF's main entrance, walked south on Scoville Avenue toward Lake Street and headed south on Ridgeland Avenue toward Julian Middle School. There, approximately 300 seventh- and eighth-graders (according to District 97's count) joined the demonstrators as they headed to the Oak Park police station. As they marched, police stood watch, sometimes facilitating traffic and safe passage, while some school employees walked with the students to manage the crowd. Outwardly, the protest appeared typical of the many student-led demonstrations in Oak Park within the last few years, particularly after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida last February and in the wake of any number of race-related conflicts that have taken place at least since former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee in 2016. "I often fear for the life of my sister who happens to be older than me, but is African American," said Savannah Broderick, a 16-year-old sophomore about her adopted sister. "This is like in the 1960s, like the love-ins in San Francisco," said her friend, 15-year-old Scout Brown. "Those are the people who created the culture. Those are the icons we see now. Those were the figureheads of this movement that is now celebrated. And someday we'll be the figureheads. The ones that TV specials are made about and books are written about." Malachi Gant, 16, said that as an African American male, he was prompted to take part in the march to express his frustration with how he's been treated in Oak Park. "People usually stare me down and look at me weird and make me feel uncomfortable," he said. But the Feb. 26 walkout, unlike the majority of demonstrations that have preceded it over the last few years, has forced both school administrators and organizers alike to confront some difficult questions, such as: When is a student protest appropriate? How will school administrators handle the increasing volume of student-led protests and demonstrations, some of which, like Tuesday's, may present safety concerns? And what are the boundaries of acceptable student expression? Antoine Ford, the 16-year-old sophomore who organized Tuesday's walkout, said he got the idea for the demonstration after administrators at Julian Middle School didn't allow a group of African-American students to perform a play he recently wrote includes a re-enactment of Trayvon Martin's famous death. Ford said that the students are members of an extracurricular group called Reinventing Student Education (RISE), which he founded roughly a month ago. Ford, who has two siblings at Julian, said he often walks from OPRF to Julian after school to facilitate the group. The group wanted the play to commemorate Martin's birthday, which is Feb. 5. "The principal [of Julian] let us purchase these hoodies we're wearing, get the script together and have our rehearsals and everything," Ford said. "Two days before the actual reenactment he denied it and told us he felt uncomfortable with us doing it. The play was appropriate. It was no type of language in there whatsoever. So, I don't understand why he told us we couldn't do it." Ford said that when his group, which has roughly a dozen members — all of them either African-American or Hispanic — requested to have a moment of silence instead, the principal "denied that, as well." Todd Fitzgerald, Julian's principal, could not be reached for comment on Tuesday afternoon. District officials directed all questions to Chris Jasculca, D97's senior director of policy, planning and communication. In a statement Jasculca issued on Tuesday afternoon, district officials explained that they found out about the walkout on Sunday. District 200 officials sent out a statement to families on Monday. Both school districts said that they would not stop students from walking out, emphasized the importance of students expressing their voices and said that they prioritize the safety of students. Regarding Ford's motive, D97 officials stated that there "have been a few different reasons given as the impetus for the walkout (commemorating the death of Trayvon Martin, speaking out against issues of violence and police brutality, etc.). However, we have not spoken directly to the organizers about what prompted the specific decision to hold today's event." In an interview on Feb. 25, D200 Superintendent Joylynn Pruitt-Adams and D200 board President Jackie Moore both agreed with Fitzgerald's decision to not allow the re-enactment, which they said was not appropriate. They also expressed concerns about how Ford's walkout was planned. In the days leading up to Tuesday's protest, Ford had a flyer designed and circulated throughout the community and online among his peers at OPRF and Julian. The flyer included his name and contact information. He said he urged students to keep the planned demonstration to themselves, because he wanted to take administrators and Oak Park police by surprise. During an interview on Sunday evening, Ford lambasted the racism he said is prevalent in Oak Park, calling a proposed racial equity policy at District 97 "a cover up to cover the racial issues that go on" and explaining that he anticipated "police pushback" on Tuesday because of his message. On Monday, Pruitt-Adams said that she met with Ford multiple times to understand his reasons for planning the walkout. "We encourage our students to have 'voice.' They're very insightful and when they exercise their voice, we try to know the rationale and to do it in a manner so you know people are listening and are going to take action," she said. "My discussion was not intended to stop him, but to talk about why and how you get your message out." The superintendent's advice was consistent with what she's told student organizers and protesters in the past. It's a message that she may be reiterating more and more often as demonstrations happen with increasing frequency. On Feb. 22, around 100 students at OPRF staged a peaceful protest outside of her office in response to the high school's treatment of black students. "They sat silently and peacefully against the walls of the hallway; there was no disruption or impediment for passersby," Priutt-Adams explained in a statement sent out to families. "I engaged individually with students about their signs. However, I did not address the group as a whole, as the protest leaders shared with me that they were not looking for a response and they were not going to respond if I did speak." The superintendent said on Monday that the silent protest did not seem to be related to Tuesday's demonstration. There were some demands connected to the Feb. 26 walkout, but they were included in a press release that went out hours before the march started and seemed rushed and disjointed. Many of the demands included things that are already happening at Districts 97 and 200, including the adoption of racial equity policies by April 30 (D97's is on track to be adopted sooner than that). Some were related to issues that fall outside of the scope of school, such as the demand that the policing system be "defunded." Moore, a longtime advocate of students using their voices to demand change and a supporter of OPRF groups like Black Leaders Union and Students Advocating for Equity — groups that Ford said helped organize the walkout — said that Tuesday's march was different from the disciplined demonstrations that BLU and SAFE have carried out in the past. "My concern as I have watched over the last few months, in particular, has been, and I've expressed this to SAFE students and others who view me as a trusted adult, is, 'Don't allow yourselves to be co-opted by someone else's agenda.'" Moore said that adults in the building should be urging students to join groups like SAFE and BLU, and to be aware of the issues happening at OPRF and in the wider community; not helping them with potentially hazardous demonstrations. "I want the adults in our community to not do harm to our children and to understand that, you know, we are working desperately to make school a safe place," she said. "I have concerns about our students leaving school, walking to Julian, walking to the police station and I don't know who is encouraging them that this is the best approach."

I actually have a kid at OPRF and wouldn't attempt to argue against their issues. That's not really the point. They should speak up BUT there needs to be a real plan of attack and not have 100 walkouts that don't seem to accomplish anything. Their concerns might be very valid but their approach to trying to make things better seems half baked.Tom Leeds Facebook VerifiedPosted: March 4th, 2019 12:31 PMThe #1 killer of black males 15 - 34 are other black males. Not the police, not people of other races. Just because you say it often enough doesn't make it true. Nick A Binotti Facebook VerifiedPosted: March 4th, 2019 10:19 AMAll student walkouts should include the chant, "Donna Martin Graduates!"Ramona Lopez Facebook VerifiedPosted: March 3rd, 2019 9:46 PMI agree Jason, these walkouts and marches lose impact when it becomes borderline routine. I also wonder how many students would come out for a march if it was on Saturday morning at 8am. Probably not as many since I'm sure quite a few "march" just to be with the in crowd or to get out of class for the afternoon. Instead, the teachers should be educating our youth on how to articulate their position on social, poitical, etc. issues (i.e. socialism, communism, equity, etc.). What I see now, is a bunch of kids who march with signs, but once confronted with someone who disagrees with them, have absolutely no idea how to have civil discourse or confront that person maturely. Without this skill, these youth (including millennials) will NEVER sway another's opinion. They are incapable of a civil debate. Instead, I see a lot of shouting, violence and marching which does nothing more than make things worse. It seems that the need for "safe space" has removed critical thinking from our schools and universities. Kids these days surround themselves with people who look like them, think like them, act like them, etc. etc. so when they hit the real world, they have absolutely no idea how to handle it and thus have acquired the label "snowflakes". OPRF should have guest speakers who are Pro Life, capitalists, libertarians, etc. and have debates or discussions with students who are Pro Choice, Pro Socialism/Communism, etc. Would do more to prepare the kids for the real world than marching down the street shouting with a placard in hand. Lastly, by allowing these marches, OPRF now has put themselves in a position where kids who are Pro Life, Trump supporters, etc. have to be given the same freedom despite its unpopularity. The more of this I see, the happier I become for sending my daughters to parochial schools. I'm broke, probably won't ever be able to actually retire, but it was well worth it. Les Golden Facebook VerifiedPosted: March 3rd, 2019 9:32 PM Why don't the black kids have a rally to stop the destruction of the Amazonian rain forests, to stop puppy mills, to stop Japanese whale hunts, to stop cereal manufacturers from destroying primate habitats to harvest palm oil, to stop Canadian pup seal massacres, to stop Palestinian Arabs from sending rockets into Israel (1000 last year), to stop trafficking in African bush meat and elephant tusks, to get Putin to withdraw from the Crimea, to legislate term limits in Illinois, to have merit selection of Cook County judges, to force insurance companies to speedily settle claims, to remove red light cameras from speed traps, to force Triton College to hire more full-time professors, to force food manufacturers to remove the additives leading to nationwide obesity, to ban fois gras, to stop inhumane food farming of pigs, chickens, and cows, to remove all elephants from circuses and zoos and place them in warm climate sanctuaries, to have Oak Park inoculate the remaining elms and ashes against DED and ash borer, to open up the park district field houses for summer supervised play, etc. etc. etc. Jason Cohen Facebook VerifiedPosted: March 3rd, 2019 5:19 PMJust got an email that another walkout is planned for tomorrow. Just walking out literally does nothing and it's losing any impact it could have because it's now a regular thing. I am all for peaceful protesting but there needs to be a plan behind it. Are there people speaking? Is there a plan to meet with the administration? At some point the school will be forced to discipline these students. What are these student leaders recommending? I think this can be a great learning experience for the students and a growth opportunity for the school but only if there's a tangible outcome to attempt to achieve. Walking around outside doesn't seem like it's moving the needle. Brian Slowiak Facebook VerifiedPosted: March 3rd, 2019 10:19 AMAnd yet not one of the racist teachers is identified, and terminated. Why doesn't the school board and upper management staff identify and terminate the racist teachers?Kathleen Priceman from Oak Park Facebook VerifiedPosted: March 3rd, 2019 8:43 AMCongratulations to Antoine Ford, the 16-year-old OPRF sophomore who recently founded the extracurricular group called Reinventing Student Education (RISE). Ford, who has two siblings at Julian, said he often walks from OPRF to Julian after school to facilitate the group. Why does a 16-year-old feel the need to "Reinvent Student Education?" I think Wednesday Journal should interview him to find out. Then interview some teachers and find out what is not happening in our schools today...progressive education. Perhaps when Dr. Kelly and the D. 97 Board "gifted" the Multicultural Education Department to the library in 2017, they created a gaping hole in our children's educational experience? Maybe Antoine had learned from his educational experience the importance of cultural pluralism and wants the same for his younger siblings? Maybe the students of Oak Park are as frustrated as their parents and teachers that the people who are elected and those who paid huge sums of money to run our public schools are ignoring our cultural and intellectual values? "While we try to teach our children all about life, our children teach us what life is all about," is a quote that I have on my desk. I hope that all of you who are disappointed that you pay so much in taxes and are given so little in return, take a look at these young people and follow their lead. It is time to put Multi-Cultural and Multi-Lingual Education in Oak Park back on center stage where it belongs. And while you're at it, stop harassing your teachers and give them the voice and respect they deserve. John Duffy Facebook VerifiedPosted: March 3rd, 2019 8:21 AMThank you Katie Wilkie for your ideas--yes, we all need more tools for peaceful and proven methods for reaching a truly democratic and racially just world. The walk-out and march to the police station were the very tactic by young students who stood up against Jim Crow schooling and voter repression generations ago. Surely, we all want our students in classrooms learning math and the lessons history can teach them about how to live and act for social justice today. They live and understand the racial injustice in education, housing, jobs, mass incarceration and police brutality which surround all of us; they are frightened, but they are not immobilized. The adults who understand this must show the same courage and resolve our children continue to demonstrate. In that process, we all together can learn and grow. That is why I joined them on Thursday. And now, 2 of our loving and supportive adult teachers are suspended, apparently for 2 brief departures in student behavior which adult supporters and school administration redirected--walking on Madison Street for 2 blocks and pounding on the windows at Julian--what is really happening here?Rob Ruffulo Facebook VerifiedPosted: March 3rd, 2019 7:32 AMWhy can't the protest be on their own time? Why are they allowed to leave school?? Force, Demand, etc....Everybody in OP RF afraid to stand up and say no. Marc Martinez from Oak Park Facebook VerifiedPosted: February 28th, 2019 2:24 PMThe problem for the school administrations is that they have lost focus on their purpose - delivering a curriculum of courses in an orderly environment. Their purpose is not to endorse, enable, promote or accommodate 'activism' or protest. So the simple answer is that students that are not disrupting classes should be allowed to do whatever they like. Students that choose to skip class for whatever reason should all face the same consequences. The school should also not be held responsible for students that choose to leave the campus. This is only a dilemma when the administration attempts to sanction some actions, some causes, some spaces, and some timeframes. Having approved or endorsed one action they will be mired in the dilemma of why any other action is not also approved or endorsed.Marc Martinez from Oak Park Facebook VerifiedPosted: February 28th, 2019 11:48 AMDeborah, no place is safe! The world is a terrifying and dangerous place full of fiends and villains (many with guns). The schools can barely deal with the daily risk of invaders, sexual predators, bullies and harassers. Not to mention our racist community and trigger happy police. The streets are rife with drunk and distracted drivers. I hope I haven't overlooked some insipient terror for children that the media, teachers, and activists have identified. But even though these kids walk around outside during non-school hours, you can be sure that if one of these waifs sustained any sort of injury while on a sojourn the district would be sued for failing to provide proper control, supervision, and protection. I am not surprised that administrators would be focused on 'safety'.Tom MacMillan from Oak Park Facebook VerifiedPosted: February 28th, 2019 8:03 AMDid anyone demand a new Olympic sized pool?Deborah Wess Facebook VerifiedPosted: February 28th, 2019 12:18 AMWhat exactly was unsafe? I've read the account 2x and don't get it. Katie Wilkie from Oak Park Facebook VerifiedPosted: February 27th, 2019 2:08 PMMy suggested solution is give them MORE tools. Don't restrict their protesting, but encourage them to do a variety of active nonviolent peace work- including (more powerful) work IN school. Those concerned should check it www.peacejam.org, as my first suggestion. I think there are good ideas from these students, and I also see the concern for having it be functional and appropriate (not interrupting their academics). Honestly, a walk out can be disruptive in a good way, but I think education on the even more powerful tools used by successful activists in our global community is the way forward. We can learn from King, Tutu, and Gandhi. We need to study India, South Africa, Guatemala, Northern Ireland There are many ways to protest, and marches and rallies are only one. Why not teach them IN school, so they can use their time without walking OUT of school. Sit ins vs walk outs. Civics wiring assignments. Debates and crafted requests for policy changes. Assessment that those policies are uplifting for the community. I wrote previously about a program called Peace Jam. That's one tool I hope can support an even more school supported activism, that doesn't disrupt the learning of these young activists. http://www.oakpark.com/News/Articles/2-12-2019/Oak-Park-schools-would-benefit-from-Peace-Jam/ www.peacejam.orgBert Fischer Facebook VerifiedPosted: February 27th, 2019 8:02 AM "....And someday we'll be the figureheads. The ones that TV specials are made about and books are written about." This quote pretty much sums up where the head of a 15 year old is on these issues. I don't think these were the same types of quotes we were hearing in the 60's. I think she is missing the point. Facebook Connect Please Enable JavaScriptFor All Site Features.
