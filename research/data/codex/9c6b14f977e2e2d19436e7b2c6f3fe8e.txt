When the girls exited their vehicle, one of the men charged at one of the girls and knocked a sign out of her hand, he said."That's when I turned my car around, and I got out to defend them,” Aparicio said. "One of the guys pulled out a knife and another guy pulled out a gun, but he dropped it and his clip fell out.”Several witnesses, including Aparacio and teacher Thomas Kerman, told the Daily Press that Sheriff's deputies responded, but did not file a report after speaking to the men in the Jeep and those involved in the incident."The police basically told us not to press charges,” Aparicio said. "They just let the guys in the jeep go and that was it.”Sheriff's spokesperson Cindy Bachman told the Daily Press on Wednesday that a caller reported a man with a gun and deputies who responded found that it was a verbal disturbance between a couple of people."No injuries and no gun found on either party, or seen when deputies reviewed a video taken by a bystander,” Bachman said. "Deputies determined no crime occurred.”Wednesday's protest was the latest in the High Desert and followed two nights of protest near the Mall of Victor Valley in Victorville over the weekend in response to George Floyd's death.Late Sunday, some demonstrators in Victorville became violent in incidents near the mall that left one deputy injured and resulted in eight arrests, according to a previous Daily Press report.Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck while he lay handcuffed on the ground.Four officers were fired. Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, was arrested and charged last week on suspicion of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.The three other officers at the scene of Floyd's death will face charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder, the Minnesota attorney general announced Wednesday.Additionally, Chauvin's charge was amended to second-degree murder Wednesday.Many in the crowd on Wednesday told the Daily Press they were mostly protesting "police brutality,” especially against those in the black and minority communities.Navy veteran and retired firefighter Jonny Reece, 47, said the death of George Floyd has driven many across the nation to unite."I fully support law enforcement, but the death of George Floyd is just another example of the police using excessive and brutal force,” said Reece, who lives in Apple Valley. "Something has got to change.”Also at the event was a Tonyan Coffee truck which offered free coffee to protesters outside of Rite Aid.Just east of the protest, on the corner of Bear Valley and Reata roads, a group of about 60 members of Oath Keepers, led by Stoney Lee Wright, held American flags and signs that read "All Lives Matter.”Many drivers who passed by honked in support while others yelled profanities and waved middle fingers at the group. At one point, several protesters walked slowly past the group, while a couple of Oath Keepers yelled, ”Jesus loves you.”Wearing a "MAGA” hat and holding an American and Trump flag, bodybuilder Stephen Davis, 36, stood with the Oath Keepers group and shared his thoughts on Black Lives Matter protests, as well as the violence, riots and looting that have occurred after some demonstrations across the country."As a black man, I've been called a coon, a sell out and other words that are not fit for print,” Davis said. "Protesting is fine as long as it's peaceful. But it's ridiculous when some people demonstrate their animalistic tendencies by looting and rioting and destroying neighborhoods.”Oath Keepers is a non-partisan association of current and former members of the military, police and first responders who pledge to fulfill the oath all military and police take to "defend the Constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic,” the group's website said.Holding a "No Justice, No Peace” sign, 25-year-old Monica Diaz said she's "tired” of reading accounts of police officers across the U.S. taking the lives of "innocent” men and women."You can add George Floyd to a growing list of black people who have been killed by cops while they were handcuffed and not a threat to anyone,” said Diaz, who lives in Victorville. "I'm Mexican, but to sit back and not say anything about this evil is just wrong.”During the protest, Apple Valley Mayor Scott Nassif and Director of Animal Services Gina Whiteside observed the growing crowd just outside of Red Robin."I'm very impressed by the diversity here, the youthfulness, the calmness as these guys are getting their voices heard and being very peaceful and obeying the traffic laws,” Nassif said. "This is a good showing of how people can express their feelings in a peaceful way and get their voices heard.”Also during the protest, several deputies were seen investigating an incident between two men near the corner of Bear Valley and Reata roads.One of the men, who wished to remain anonymous, told the Daily Press that he was "sucker punched by a Trump supporter.”"One guy was talking smack to my mom, so I told him to back off,” the unidentified man said as blood ran down his face. "Next thing I know, this other guy hit me from behind.”Rene Ray De La Cruz may be reached at 760-951-6227, or by email at RDeLaCruz@VVDailyPress.com. Follow him on Twitter @DP_ReneDeLaCruz.
