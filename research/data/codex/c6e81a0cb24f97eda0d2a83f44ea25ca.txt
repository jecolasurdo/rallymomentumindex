Withrow football team's national anthem protest grows Mark Curnutte, mcurnutte@enquirer.com Published 4:47 p.m. ET Sept. 23, 2016 | Updated 9:48 p.m. ET Sept. 23, 2016CLOSE Four Withrow High School football players joined in the protest movement started by Colin Kaepernick, raising their fists during the National Anthem before their game against Loveland High School.

A few uniformed players and injured players in street clothes took a knee. Only three or four players appeared to not participate in the protest.Their head coach, Zack Davis, who is white, stood several yards away from his players on the field, at attention, with his hand over his heart during the anthem.Anderson Township is a predominantly white, upscale community, and almost its entire varsity football roster is made up of white players. No criticism of the Withrow players could be detected from Anderson fans or its student section.Four Withrow players joined in the national movement of peaceful anthem protest during their game last week at Loveland, another largely white, affluent community.CINCINNATI.COMFour Withrow footballers raise fists during 'Banner'The Withrow players are part of a growing movement of athletes, almost exclusively African-Americans, who are making a peaceful protest during the national anthem before games.San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was the first to protest, initially sitting on the bench during the anthem before modifying his protest to taking a knee. Players with several other NFL, college and high school football teams and women's professional basketball players are following the lead in protest of the police shootings of unarmed black men around the country and of prevailing racial injustice.The Withrow players, in an earlier interview with The Enquirer and Cincinnati.com, had promised to make another protest gesture at Anderson. Two more police shooting deaths of African-American men in the past week steeled their resolve to again protest and involve more players, they said.Dressed in black uniform pants and white jerseys, Withrow players lined up on their sideline and faced the flagpole at the south end of the Anderson stadium. They fixed their eyes on the flag, holding their places without noticeable body movement or facial expression. No player placed his interests above those of the team.They should not face any disciplinary action for their protest, according to a document circulated to Cincinnati Public Schools building principals Friday ahead of that night's football games.The brief statement reads: "Cincinnati Public Schools, in respect of the flag and all who have served our country, encourages its students to stand during the national anthem. If a student chooses not to stand as an expression of the student's individual beliefs, Cincinnati Public Schools respects the student's right to freedom of speech."Janet Walsh, the district spokeswoman, said students would not be disciplined or punished.The players' protest Friday night met with approval from their parents and alumni at the game.Alandes Powell of Forest Park is the mother of senior offensive lineman Julian Powell."I asked him to articulate for me why he was going to protest,” she said. "He told me, 'The disparities with black people we are always talking about. I could be one of those black men killed.' ”Powell, a board member at the Urban League of Greater Southwestern Ohio, said the protest by black athletes has "zero to do with disrespecting the men and women who serve or who have served in the military. It has to do with the dangers and disparities we face.”Orlando Albright, a 1989 Withrow graduate, former football player and Withrow athletics booster, appreciated the thinking and awareness behind the Withrow protest."They're paying attention to current events, which is good,” said Albright, of Walnut Hills. "These kids know what's going on in the world around them. The issue of police-community relations is huge right now.”CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://cin.ci/2d4BQ2eFind JobsShare your feedback to help improve our site experience!
