Dozens of protesters took part in the four-mile trek, but organizers said the 90-degree temperature certainly decreased the anticipated turnout since previous rallies attracted hundreds. One of the people continuously at the front of the march leading chants was Kaylee McNeil, 16, of Plymouth, one of the organizers. "I'm exhausted. I almost had a heat stroke. My knee almost gave out. My voice is shaky,” McNeil said. But those who participated say it was well worth it making their voices heard in the streets with chants like "I can't breathe” and "Enough is enough.” "The weather was against us. It wasn't easy,” said Moustafa Almeky, 20, of Dallas, one of the organizers who also led many of the chants. Toward the end of the march, the group laid face down on the north lawn of the Luzerne County Courthouse with their hands behind their backs. They laid there for more than eight minutes to mark the length of time George Floyd's neck was pinned down by a Minneapolis police officer's knee prior to his death in custody on Memorial Day, a crime that has sparked protests nationwide and calls for police reform. "I'm not going to lie. I thought there would be more people, but it's 90 degrees out,” Almeky said. "You guys are strong as hell.” With multiple police vehicles serving as escorts and barriers between other traffic, marchers walked down Market Street over the Market Street Bridge into Kingston, down Wyoming Avenue to Pierce Street and then over the Pierce Street bridge back into Wilkes-Barre and to Public Square. They largely were greeted with support by passing motorists and others watching, including a honk and wave from the crew of a Kingston garbage truck and a FedEx driver. However, they did get heckled a few times, including by a man passing the courthouse who gave them the middle finger and another who shouted, "You're wasting your time and everybody else's, too.” Back at Public Square, after a few speeches, the group raised their fists and shouted "Black Lives Matter” to complete the day's journey. "Not one of you gave up,” McNeil said. "I'm so proud of you, but this is not the end.” McNeil said she thinks it is important to be a leader in the movement despite the fact she is a teenager. "I think it's important to help make change because it starts with the younger generation,” McNeil said. Candice Harris, 34, of Edwardsville, arrived at the march with her infant daughter in a stroller with a sign saying, "That could have been my daddy.” "This anger and frustration has built up,” Harris said. "This wasn't an isolated incident.” No incidents were reported during the march, although three marchers temporarily collapsed from heat exhaustion, Kingston police Chief Rick Kotchik said. Police gave one man a ride to catch up to the group, while two others asked for a ride to the courthouse, to be there when the protest arrived. "That shows what we're about,” Kotchik said. "We're not the bad guys.” Kotchik said he believed in their right to protest and police were there to do what they are sworn to do: protect and serve. "I believe in their right to protest. It's a constitutional right. Just like I believe in the Second Amendment and all the other amendments. That's why our country is free,” Kotchik said. "I respect the fact they were peaceful. We were there to protect them from hecklers and people getting mad about the traffic. That's why we were there. I hope they recognize that.” Contact the writer: bkalinowski@citizensvoice.com 570-821-2055, @cvbobkal We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.
