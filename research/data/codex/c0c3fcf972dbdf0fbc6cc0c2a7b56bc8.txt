Carlton Branscomb of the First Baptist Church of Princeton. "Doing nothing to fight against the racism and the culture of violence that has become passé in America is not an option for those good folks among us.”Branscomb said that while the country must continue to fight racism, it is important to remember that not all police officers are party to it."Some of the officers that we have became police because they wanted to do good things, to be good folks who protect and serve, inspire and empower the communities they live in and work in,” Branscomb said. Organizers thanked Princeton police for quickly accommodating their demonstration request.In between the speakers, Daniel Harris, the poet who organized the rally, rattled off call-and-response chants to the crowd, such as "What do we want? Justice. When do we want it? Now!”"When something awful happens to one of us, it happens to us all,” Harris read from a joint statement from Princeton Mayor Liz Lempert and Councilman Lance Liverman in support of the rally.The rally attracted people from other communities, as well. Rev. Francisco Pozo of Christ Episcopal Church in Trenton spoke about the harm that racism inflicts on society."We want justice for everyone, not just one group,” Pozo said. "It diminishes all races to allow racism to be the law of the land.”Many speakers urged the rally's attendees not to allow their passion to wane, saying that in order to change society, there must be this type of protest every time a young, unarmed, black man is unjustly killed by the police.Rev. Bob Moore, who serves as executive director of the Coalition for Peace Action in Princeton, spoke about his shock not only at Brown's death, but also at the way peaceful protesters have been treated in Ferguson since Brown was killed."What country am I looking at?” Moore asked.The militarization of police forces around the country poses a major threat to the country, he said."We need to stop this,” Moore said.While many of the speakers were older, Joseph Dawes, a black student at Princeton High School, stepped up to speak about the difficulty of realizing that he could be profiled."I look forward to a time in our society when my brother and even my father are not viewed as automatic suspects,” he said.The event lasted more than an hour, before Harris concluded it with a short speech."Mike Brown's death is mine as well as yours,” Harris said.He then led the entire crowd in a chorus of the traditional spiritual, "We shall overcome” to end the event.Brendan McGrath may be reached at bmcgrath@njtimes.com.
