"No justice, no peace," they shouted as they left Town Square Park on their journey that ended at the Delaney Park Strip. "We know why we're here," said East Anchorage High School student Markus Vinson who organized the protest. Vinson and the others showed their support of George Floyd, the man who died while in the custody of police in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The demonstration also wanted to highlight others who died after an encounter with law enforcement officers, especially African Americans in Alaska. "We're here because the color of my skin could get me a death sentence. We're here because when I want to go on a run, I have to think twice," Vinson said. "When I want to hold my cell phone, I have to think twice. When I want to play a game outside, like a kid should be able to, I have to think twice." Downtown is not the only place where a demonstration took place. "I can't breathe. I can't breathe," shouted the huge crowd that packed the REI parking lot for a similar demonstration. Organizers of the "I Can't Breathe" protest delivered the message that police brutality is unacceptable anywhere. Like the other demonstration, this one also called for an end to violence by law enforcement officers against minorities, including Alaska Natives. "At what point do our kids go from cute to suspect?" Jasmin Smith asked the crowd at the rally she organized. "It's a worry parents of color have every day. It's real, you see it every day. You see in on the TV, but you feel it. It's that PTSD that's deep inside that you don't know where it came from, you just know that it's there." Protesters have not ruled out taking their message to the streets again. Editor's note: This story has been revised to correct a misspelling. Copyright 2020 KTVA. All rights reserved.
