Author: KIII Published: 11:00 AM CDT September 25, 2016 Updated: 11:00 AM CDT September 25, 2016 SAN ANTONIO -- Because of police shootings involving African-American men, tensions have risen across the country. Some cities are reaching a boiling point, but what about San Antonio?On Saturday afternoon, demonstrators demanded change before something tragic happens in San Antonio.With each death comes greater resolve. "Even though it enrages me, I have to find peace," said demonstrator Genica Handy."It doesn't matter where it's happening. Injustice is injustice. And I can't stand for it," said another demonstrator, Jake Goforth.More than 100 people marched through downtown San Antonio to demand justice for two black men killed by police across the country.Co-organizer Johnathan-David Jones said this is the fifth time he's led a march after watching the death of a black man – or black men."We lose one of our brothers, we all feel that weight," Jones said. "I hate to say that I'm used to this. I don't wanna be the guy to say that because the reason we have to gather is that someone died."The march also comes amid increased scrutiny for the cause.Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick recently told the Texas Tribune he blames Black Lives Matter for the recent mass killing of Dallas police officers.While this protest was not part of that movement, the words still hit home."If it weren't for the system, none of this would have happened in the first place," Jones said. "If it weren't for the officers that killed those individuals, there wouldn't have been a response.And these San Antonians say they'll continue to respond as long as there's injustice to fight -- with one loud voice."I see people who don't look like me who believe in the same things I believe in," Handy said. "To have that support, it means a lot."
