Speakers demanded justice for Michael Brown and others killed and brutalized by the police and vowed to continue their fights for justice, including support for a Sept. 30 Milwaukee rally to demand justice for Dontre Hamilton, a 31-year-old Black man who was unjustly shot and killed by Milwaukee police in a public park. Before the protest, Michelle Alexander, author of "The New Jim Crow,” spoke to a crowd of 2,000 at the college.
