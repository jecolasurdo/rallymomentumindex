Protests reignited nationwide this month after officers shot and killed black men in Baton Rouge, La. and St. Paul, Minn. on July 5 and 6, and then a sniper shot and killed five Dallas police officers at a protest on July 7.Terry Chappele said he marched Monday "for justice. Police shouldn't be killing anybody, and we shouldn't be killing police."Protesters met at Frances Stevens Park, marched south on Palm Canyon Drive to Tahquitz Canyon Way, then returned, despite temperatures topping 100 degrees. In cooperation with police, they walked two-by-two on city sidewalks, chanting "No justice, no peace" and "Hands up, don't shoot," the slogan that originated in Ferguson, Mo. in 2014.Buy PhotoStacy Black leads a chant as about 150 people march through downtown Palm Springs as part of the Black Lives Matter movement, July 25, 2016. (Photo: Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun)Several passersby in cars honked their support. One pedestrian stopped to shout, "All lives matter," and another driver, to proclaim his support for Donald Trump in the presidential election.Palm Springs Police Department Lt. Mike Kovaleff touted communication between organizers and police as a critical piece of the rally's "success.""We serve such a responsive and involved community that, as expected, the event went off without a hitch," Kovaleff said.Organizer Lasoya Nicholson shared frustration in a speech after the march, but said she hoped the rally would be merely a first step to improving community-police dialogue."When I first heard of the death of Alton Sterling, I was beyond frustrated. Another death of a black man," Nicholson told the crowd. "We're here organizing another march... another hashtag, another name to add to the list."READ MORE: Black Lives Matter organizers on their motivations, experiences with policeStacy Black, who works with the Health and Wellness Committee of Desert Highland Gateway Estates — a historically African-American neighborhood at the north end of Palm Springs — said she feels there's been a long history of distrust between the city's black community and the police, dating back to the city's eviction of residents from Section 14 in the 1960s.Black said organizers were glad the protest was peaceful and organized. During the march, at least one protester talked to a police officer about incidents of bias he'd faced in the past.Next, the group wants to have a community forum where police and citizens can talk to one another directly, "so we can build trust between the police department and the citizens," Black said.PSPD's Kovaleff confirmed that discussions about a forum are underway, and said the department's communication with Black Lives Matter activists "has been nothing but positive."And in response to black residents wary of police, he said, "The men and women of the Palm Springs Police Department are dedicated to providing courteous, ethical and professional service to all... if there is any question about how they were treated, contact us and we look forward to resolving any issues."READ MORE: Coachella protest echoes anti-violence rallies across the U.S.FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInBlack Lives Matter protest in Palm Springs FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
