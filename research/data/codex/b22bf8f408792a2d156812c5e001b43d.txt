(Photo by Stephanie Keith/Getty Images) NEW YORK CITY — Hundreds of New Yorkers with covered faces and dressed in black took to city streets Friday to tell law enforcement officials across the nation, "We can't breathe." Marchers and faith leaders gathered at Foley Square about 4 p.m. to protest the death of George Floyd, a Minnesota man who died with a local cop's knee on his throat, and a 911 call made against a Central Park bird watcher who asked a white woman to put her dog on a leash. "We'll gather with clergy and the families of victims to say the names of those killed," organizers Justice League NYC wrote on Facebook. "And demand our city and our nation value Black Lives." #JusticeForGeorgeFloyd #WeCantBreathe pic.twitter.com/8KFSbbtonO— Justice League NYC (@NYjusticeleague) May 29, 2020 To keep up to date with breaking news in NYC, sign up for Patch's newsletter. Marchers planned to head toward Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance's office to demand the arrest of Amy Cooper, the woman who called 911 to report bird watcher Christian Cooper, who is Black, with hate crime charges, organizers wrote. Protesting was complicated by the novel coronavirus pandemic and a fight to stop its spread which includes state regulations mandating face coverings and barring large gatherings.

NYC!!!!! WE CANT BREATHE. We at FOLEY SQUARE TOMORROW AT 4PM!!!! See u there. Pls wear ur mask! pic.twitter.com/Ok1SAA2Hsy— Cyn Santana (@Cyn_Santana) May 29, 2020Derek Chauvin, the Minnesota police officer who pinned down Floyd, faces charges of unintentional murder and manslaughter, Minnesota prosecutors said Friday. The arrest came one day after Floyd's death spurred protests across the nation, including a Union Square rally where more than 70 people were arrested. President Donald Trump has called the protesters "thugs" in a message that Twitter initially unpublished for "glorifying violence" then republished because it was of "public interest." "When the looting starts, the shooting starts," wrote the president. New York leaders have shown support for the protesters, with Mayor Bill de Blasio tweeting he was "horrified" by the video of Floyd's death and calling for the officer to be charged. "I couldn't believe the officer's lack of concern," de Blasio said during his Friday press briefing. "This kinda thing just can't happen." Gov. Andrew Cuomo declined to comment on the safety of protesting during the pandemic during his daily press briefing, saying New Yorkers had a right to gather. "I get it," said Cuomo. "I'm with the protesters." Another rally is slated to take place outside the Barclays Center in Brooklyn at 6 p.m.Subscribe Back to the New York City Patch More from New York CityUp next on New York City Patch Local News | 29m Cuomo Gives Last Coronavirus Address In The Wake Of NYC Reopening 29m Local News | 2h Juneteenth Will Become Official NYC Holiday, Mayor Announces 2h Local News | 22h City Council Passes Chokehold Ban Mayor Promises To Sign 22h Read more local news from New York City What are Featured Events?
