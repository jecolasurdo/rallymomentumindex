A couple of hundred protesters holding signs chanted, "Black lives, they matter here” near a Stater Bros. market on Yucaipa Boulevard before marching to the sheriff's station where they knelt and observed a nine-minute moment of silence for George Floyd, matching the length of time a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck before he died.

Two groups came together in the parking lot and spoke loudly and passionately at each other, face to face, watched by security guards and deputies. The message, though, seemed to be about peace. "Prayer is effective,” Yucaipa resident Michele Wilson tells the crowd of a couple hundred at Yucaipa police station during #GeorgeFloydProtest. #BlackLivesMatter @ivdailybulletin @RedlandsNews @sun @pressenterprise pic.twitter.com/3pb7XulH6M — Cindy Yamanaka (@Cyamanaka7) June 2, 2020 One group appeared to be protesters; the others a group of mostly white men who said they were there to "protect” the city. One man who declined to give his full name said both groups were fearful, and if they just calm each other down, things would stay peaceful. Another man, who would not give his name, said he was one of those seen armed Monday night on Yucaipa Boulevard. He said he was there to protect a friend's business. The tensions were a continuation from Monday night when, according to videos posted on social media, protesters and another group clashed in the city. YUCAIPA PROTESTS-In collaboration with the Mayor & City Council @CityofYucaipa your Police Department would like address concerns of recent activity within the community. While the Police Department was extremely busy with calls for service overnight, we responded to numerous — Yucaipa Police (@YucaipaPD) June 3, 2020 The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department on Tuesday afternoon said they investigated reports of fights and people illegally carrying weapons. "Deputies responded to a fight call at the ARCO gas station. When deputies arrived, two subjects were contacted and they both refused to press charges,” the Sheriff's Department said in a series of Twitter messages. "No other victims came forward during that time. In light of social media posts and video that has surfaced, we believe there may be additional victims. They are encouraged to contact the Yucaipa Police Department to be included in the investigation.” Deputies investigating a brandishing report stopped a car and arrested a felon in possession of a firearm. Sheriff's officials also said they are aware of photos showing business owners on rooftops and on their property carrying weapons. Deputies reached out to business owners and residents to educate them on firearms laws, the department said. At Tuesday's protest, counter demonstrator Jerry Bender, of Yucaipa, arrived clutching a Trump flag saying he wants to protect the city he loves. During a civil conversation he told protesters, "I wish I could invite you all for BBQ.” Protesters on Tuesday were not focused only on the treatment of blacks. Juan Rodriguez, a senior at Yucaipa High who is a native of the city, said every day someone tells him to "go home.” Rodriguez said his school doesn't do enough to confront racism. "Look at what we can do together,” he told the protesters who assembled at the sheriff's station. "We will always overpower the hate.” By about 4 p.m. the protest started winding down. In official social media accounts Monday night the city said it is "not enforcing a curfew at this time,” though other cities in the county were following fires and looting, notably in San Bernardino Sunday night. Yucaipa Mayor David Avila didn't immediately respond to questions about whether the city planned a curfew for Tuesday night. Floyd died May 25, after Minneapolis police arrested and handcuffed him on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a deli. Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for more than 8 minutes, while Floyd repeatedly said he could not breathe and eventually lost consciousness. Chauvin has been fired from the police department and, on May 29, was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter.
