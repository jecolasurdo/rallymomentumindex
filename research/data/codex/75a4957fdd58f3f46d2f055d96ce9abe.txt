"We are taking steps for next Friday to ensure our young men can make a stand for social injustice, while at the same time not showing, what is perceived as, disrespect,” coach Jordan Johnson said. "We support our young men in an effort to make a change for their future.” RELATED: Entire team in San Francisco takes a knee during anthem That alternative was that the entire team took a knee after the first play of the game and took a delay of game penalty. "I am so proud of our young men and their desire to see change occur! I could not be at a better place!,” Johnson tweeted after the game. Among those supporting Tre Chappell, the lone player to take a knee last week, were members of the Kentucky Green Party, as seen in the video above. A number of other players initially kneeled but stood when the music began playing. RELATED: Pregame threats for Maryland team that kneeled @WHAS11Heather This is Allison frm Green Party.
