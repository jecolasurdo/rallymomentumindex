The Cincinnati Police Department said 1,500 people gathered to help make a change with a march through the streets of downtown Cincinnati. People from all walks of life attended, highlighting the police shooting deaths of Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Sam DuBose, Timothy Thomas and more. Before the march took place, Sam DuBose's mother, Audrey DuBose, spoke before the crowd. "His life was just taken, stolen from him, that's what to focus on, focus on this man executing my son, murdering my son," said DuBose. While Audrey Dubose still feels the pain of losing her son, some others are worried about their family's future. "I have five brothers and I refuse to let them be victims of police brutality," stated Shawna Hedges. "It's just a shame to see that they had to go that way for nothing, neither of their deaths were justified. And I refuse to let any of my family members go like that. None of my five brothers are going like that." The group marched from the police station, down Central Avenue, around City Hall at East 7th Street and moved to the corner of Republic. That's where a throng of people took a minute to remember Thomas, who was killed by an officer in 2001 in that very spot.

"Everybody is entitled to live their life without having to be in fear of someone coming after them or someone doing something to them because of the color of their skin," said Lashay Hunley. Black Lives Matter organizers read aloud the names of individuals that have died because of altercations with the law. Supporters then continued to call for cultural change before a quiet and peaceful ending in Washington Park. Copyright 2016 WXIX.
