Paxson Haws/The Daily Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Hundreds of students protested two anti-Black Lives Matter demonstrators who came to campus without a permit and without notice."You're a racist," the anti-BLM demonstrator told multiple students."Liberals have no sense of humor," he told another student. "I don't let women tell me what to do." These are just examples of the messages the man, who wore a Donald Trump button by his right shoulder and a shirt that said "Allah is Satan" on the front, spewed verbally.The other demonstrator held a sign that read "BLM Rent A Riot" on one side and "BLM Are Racist Thugs" on the other. "You have no place to be here," OU President David Boren told the men through a megaphone after being helped up onto the time capsule north of the Seed Sower Statue. .@President_Boren here."You have no place to be here.
