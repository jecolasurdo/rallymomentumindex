"I feel as though that the death of Freddie Gray is the tip of the iceberg."After the 30 or so protesters had gathered on the circle, they began to march toward the City-County Building. About 10 minutes into the march, a pit-stop was made in front of the City-County Building where demonstrators were given the opportunity to speak about their experiences with Indianapolis police."They say, 'Is Indy next?' Yes, Indy's next," one demonstrator told the group. "Getting people to move from inaction to action is a difficult thing...we're too inactive in Indianapolis."Then, for a few moments, the protest became more about how to garner support from Hoosiers than accusations of law enforcement's abuse of power and force. Many of the protesters agreed that each of them needed to reach out individually to people in their communities and discuss the importance of what was going on in the country."If they haven't heard about it yet," one demonstrator shouted, "they're going to hear about it tonight."We're not going to take it from IMPD, we're not going to take it from Chief Hite, we're not going to take it from the sheriff's department, Beech Grove, we're not going to take it from Carmel, we're just not going to take it," said a protester who said she wanted to be identified as Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old boy who was shot and killed by police last year in Cleveland.Another protestor, who identified herself as Rekia Boyd, a 22-year-old woman killed by police in Chicago, said she's going to continue to keep talking about those who have died at the hands of police, spreading the word and creating events for Hoosiers to voice their opinion."People don't want to believe it's going on," said Boyd. "But it's happening here."Call Star reporter Michael Anthony Adams at (317) 444-6123.
