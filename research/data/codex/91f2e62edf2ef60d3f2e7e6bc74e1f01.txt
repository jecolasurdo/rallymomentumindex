Protesters faceoff with police in downtown Fargo FARGO — Roughly 2,000 demonstrators are still marching through the streets of Fargo and more recently West Fargo Saturday, May 30, in protest of the death of George Floyd. Floyd, a black man, died in the custody of Minneapolis police after a white officer, Derek Chauvin, knelt on his neck for several minutes on Monday, May 25. Floyd's death has sparked massive protests in Minneapolis and other cities across the country. Chauvin has been arrested and charged with murder and manslaughter. The Fargo protest, which has so far remained peaceful, began at 10 a.m. at Island Park before it continued through the downtown streets, moving west 20 blocks to police headquarters at 25th Street and First Avenue North, and then south on 25th Street. At about 1 p.m., the Fargo Police Department posted on its social media pages, asking people to avoid 13th Avenue South and 25th Street South because "the area is becoming impassable." Police later said the marchers were moving west toward West Acres mall but the group appeared to get smaller as time went on. Protesters shouted various chants, including "I can't breathe", referring to the fact that Floyd could be heard in a video of his arrest saying he couldn't breathe as the officer knelt on Floyd's neck. Protesters also chanted "What's his name? George Floyd", "No justice, no peace" and "Prosecute the police." Law enforcement officers in riot gear was stationed in front of Fargo police headquarters, but there have been no reports of violence. Moorhead Mayor Jonathan Judd and Fargo Mayor Tim Mahoney interacted with protesters at Fargo police headquarters, and the crowd moved on shortly afterward. Protesters headed west, eventually arriving at the West Fargo Police Department, where they peacefully protested for about a half hour while about 100 police officers from various jurisdictions stood watch, most wearing helmets and face shields. At one point, there was a mild confrontation between a nearby homeowner and some protesters. A half-dozen officers calmed the situation and the protesters kept marching through the street. Protester of all ages, some pushing baby strollers and walking with kids, are taking part, and some people have been handing out water, snacks and masks.
