Gary in 2016 accused a former Charlottesville police officer, Christopher A. Seymore, of sexual assault CHRIS SUAREZ/THE DAILY PROGRESS Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save About a dozen people gathered in front of the Charlottesville Police Department on Tuesday morning to protest the slow-turning wheels of justice in the case of a former police officer charged with sexually assaulting a city woman in November 2016 and the harassment of the alleged victim by unknown persons.Christopher A. Seymore, 36, had been a city officer for 18 months when he was arrested in December 2016 and charged with two counts of forcible sodomy.Shortly after his arrest, he was released on $10,000 bond on the condition that he not contact the woman who claimed he had assaulted her or return to Charlottesville except for court-related matters. Among Tuesday's protesters was the alleged victim, Ronna Gary, who said she has been harassed and her property vandalized since she filed the complaint against Seymore and that continued delays in the case have caused her emotional duress.The Daily Progress does not identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they wish to be named. Gary was supported by local activists associating with the Black Lives Matter and Me Too movements, the latter having recently captured the national conscience following a flurry of sexual assault allegations against high-profile political and media figures who have been fired or resigned from their jobs as a result.Gary said she is frustrated with the yearlong effort to prosecute Seymore. His case was sent to a grand jury in April, and he was formally indicted in June. His trial was scheduled for last week, but it was canceled due to a witness being hospitalized. Attempts to reschedule it for this week were unsuccessful, due to another witness being unavailable."I just want a fair and speedy trial. I want to be done. I want my life back,” Gary said.Virginia's statute requiring a speedy trial only applies to the person charged with a crime and not the victim. But Charlottesville Commonwealth's Attorney Dave Chapman said the Seymore case is a "high priority,” especially because of Seymore's position as a police officer at the time of the offense. He said the delays were unfortunate, but unavoidable. Chapman said the trial could be rescheduled informally before a hearing in the case next week.
