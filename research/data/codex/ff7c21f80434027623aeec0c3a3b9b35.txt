Protests there ended with 80 arrests and several businesses up in flames.In Cleveland, protests drew on the fact that Tamir, like Brown, was young, black and died at the hands of a white cop.Police here responded calmly to the protests, which started on Public Square and moved to the Shoreway, which closed for about an hour. Officers closed intersections as the crowd moved through streets. A police spokeswoman said no arrests resulted from the protests.Police to surrender some informationIn an investigation that has been largely guarded from the start, Cleveland police are finally conceding to pressure from the media and Tamir Rice's family to share more information with the public.After receiving a written request Tuesday from Tamir's family, Cleveland police said they would release the surveillance footage that shows the boy's killing. The release is scheduled for 1 p.m. Wednesday at a news conference.The family's letter rejected Cleveland police's defense that they wouldn't release the video out of respect for Tamir's family."We feel the actions of the patrol officer who took our son's life must be made public," the letter said.Police also plan to release the name of the first-year officer who shot Tamir and is now on administrative leave.The release of the video also follows negotiations between the city and Dave Marburger, an attorney for the Northeast Ohio Media Group, which maintains that video is public record and can't be shielded by criminal investigations.Amid questions about whether the officer might have been too quick to fire shots because he mistook Tamir for a man, the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office denied requests from Northeast Ohio Media Group for the boy's height and weight.A spokesman cited legislation that makes an exception to public records law that enables the office to withhold autopsy information, but does not prohibit the release of such information.Community demands answersAt an evening public forum that had citizens lined up outside the Cudell Rec Center, people pressed police and city officials about training and police protocol for dealing with children and mentally disabled people.A rowdy crowd reacted as some audience members expressed their frustration with the department. One speaker called Cleveland police "neo-Nazis" who shouldn't be allowed in the black community."To us mothers who are losing children, it seems to me that the police are the biggest gang," one woman said.Police Chief Calvin Williams said officers will be equipped with body cameras by the end of January.Northeast Ohio Media Group reporters contributed to this story.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).Â© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
