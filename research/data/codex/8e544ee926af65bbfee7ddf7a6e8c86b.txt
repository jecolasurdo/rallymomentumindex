Roger DuPuis | Times Leader A demonstrator holds aloft a sign on Pierce Street Wednesday afternoon. Among its slogans is 'I can't breathe,' a saying associated with the Black Lives Matter movement after three black men — Eric Garner, Javier Ambler and most recently, George Floyd — uttered the words to police officers who were restraining them prior to their deaths in three separate incidents across the U.S. between 2014 and last month.

Roger DuPuis | Times Leader WILKES-BARRE — Sweltering, yes, but Wednesday afternoon was otherwise a beautiful day to be out on Public Square. Except that Candice Harris and her family weren't there to socialize. Rather, the Edwardsville resident, with her three sons and two-year-old daughter, gathered to join others in the latest in a series of local rallies protesting racial injustice and police brutality. On their shirts: "Black Lives Matter.” On her daughter's stroller, a more pointed message: "That could have been my daddy.” It referred, of course, to George Floyd a black man who died while being pinned down by a Minneapolis police officer on Memorial Day, leading to protests across the nation. "I think it's important to educate your children on it,” Harris said. And she believes peaceful protests such as these make a difference. "I know some people don't feel that way, but I do,” said Harris. "I attended my first rally in Wilkes-Barre a few years ago. Just from then to now, to see the difference, to see more people come out and spread awareness, that's what it's all about.” Harris and her family were among about 100 people who gathered on Public Square in the early afternoon to hear several speeches before they embarked on a 3.5-mile walk to Kingston and back. 'Get our message out' Lakina Hughes and Kaylee McNeil — both local high school freshmen — and Wilkes University student Moustafa Almeky organized Wednesday's protest, as they've done with multiple protests over the past week. "We just want to get our message out there,” McNeil said before the march. "This isn't easy to pull off, but we've got great support and we want everyone to be vocal.” With the help of the Black Lives Matter Wilkes-Barre Facebook group, the three organizers were able to spread the word about Wednesday's gathering quickly. The crowd wasn't as big as some of the other Public Square protests, but Almeky wasn't deterred. "It's hot out here, a lot of people can't physically make the walk all the way through,” Almeky said. "But whether it's 50 or 500 people, I'm fine with it.” Temperatures were up around 92 degrees Wednesday afternoon. Several speakers also underscored the importance of voting, and a voter registration table had been set up on the square. "We want to help you, and the best way to help yourselves is to register to vote and get people out of office who don't want to help,” local criminal defense attorney Theron J. Solomon said. Also on scene was attorney Larry Kansky, acting on behalf of the group as a legal observer. "These protests have been peaceful and well-done,” Kansky said. "The police have been fully cooperative.” Officers from Wilkes-Barre, Kingston and Forty Fort led the way as the march began, crossing the Market Street Bridge into Kingston and turning onto Wyoming Avenue. Squad cars blocked off a lane of traffic for protesters to be able to walk safely, and everything ran smoothly as the group came back up Pierce Street and across the Pierce Street Bridge before making a stop outside the Luzerne County Courthouse. The Courthouse served as a backdrop as the group paused for what has become a signature moment of these Black Lives Matter protests: in recognition of Floyd's nearly nine-minute struggle under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer, everyone got down on their stomachs, hands behind their back, and chanted "I can't breathe.” More marches planned The march ended where it began, back on Public Square. The crowd dispersed, but the movement isn't going away anytime soon. Black Lives Matter Wilkes-Barre already has a protest set up for Friday afternoon. And on Sunday, an event posted in the group touts a walk from Kirby Park to the courthouse. The crowds aren't going away, and the noise won't be turned down. "I know some people think we're just standing here screaming,” McNeil said. "We just want everyone around here to know what we're fighting for.” PreviousWolf, lawmakers clash over emergency declaration NextState issues guidelines for sports on all levels to follow Nurses Month: Kayla Galdieri May 01, 2020 The heroes among us today don't wear capes, but scrubs and face masks. Kayla Galdieri is among those who belong on the hero pedestal. Galdieri is a nurse at Geisinger Wyoming Valley in the Progressive Care Unit, just one notch below the ICU. Typically, she helps patients. However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Galdieri's job has become much more than it was. "We have pretty sick patients usually, and I am assigned three patients at a time,” Galdieri said. "We'll go in and take care of our patients normally, some of them will be in isolation depending on how sick they are.” During the pandemic though, things have changed drastically for all nurses, including Galdieri. "Now, we still have three patients but now a lot of them are in isolation because of COVID-19 and everything,” Galdieri said. "So, we have to have full blown isolation gear and have (n95 masks) on our face which is really hard to breathe, and we have to wear masks even when we aren't in the COVID rooms. "It is good that we are wearing them, but it is rough. I work 12 hours each day and its rough to wear them all day.” This pandemic has also changed how each of these nurses does their job. "It's hard because no matter what we can't be in those rooms as much as we want too,” Galdieri said. "It's like everything we have learned as a nurse is totally different now.” On top of the struggle and risks taken at work, every nurse has had to make an even greater sacrifice, which is limiting contact with their families. "I live with my fiancé who still works as an essential worker, so we have been going forward together as normal at our house,” Galdieri said. "I am very close with my family though. I usually see my mom and dad and go to their house like three or four times a week before all of this. Now I haven't been able to see them because I don't want to get them sick. "On top of all of this I am supposed to be getting married in August so hopefully it doesn't get pushed back. We had so much planned into this and it is all so stressful.” The pandemic and shutdown have affected many people and unfortunately it continues to affect the lives of many, including the heroes on the front line. We thank Kayla Galdieri for her sacrifice to help others, even at the expense of seeing her own family for the time being. Fire And Ice celebrates its grand re-opening with ribbon cutting January 17, 2020 TRUCKSVILLE — Fire And Ice was only closed for 10 days as its new owner, Rob Friedman, renovated it, but those 10 days were enough to drastically rejuvenate the venue's already good looks. The bar and restaurant has been a Back Mountain staple for years, but now it's been added to Friedman's growing repertoire of hospitality properties. On Friday night, the restaurateur officially held a ribbon-cutting to celebrate its grand re-opening. "This place has such a rich history,” Friedman said to those gathered in attendance, over-sized scissors in hand before the ribbon-cutting. "And we hope to make it better.” According to Friedman, some of the improvements that are being brought to Fire And Ice include a brand new menu, intricate stained glass windows, a new bar area and even a new happy hour. Friedman said he employed a small team of local contractors — who he said did "amazing work” — in the 10 days the restaurant was closed in order to wrap the renovations up as quickly as possible. And while Friedman said it was important to freshen up the space, it was also important to keep it original. For example, the bar space has been substantially updated, but still maintains its original flavor. "We kept the original bar back,” he said. "But the bar could originally fit only six people, and now you can fit about 14 people.” Friedman said an important part of the process was bringing on a team of experts, including head chef David Shrader, sous chef Jack Higgins and general manager Theresa Kazminski. Fire And Ice will be debuting a new happy hour, which will occur on Fridays and Saturdays from 8:30 to 10:30 p.m. Fire And Ice was sold to Friedman in November, and it joins his list of other restaurants, which include Kevin's Bar & Restaurant in Kingston, the Beaumont Inn in Dallas, Cork Bar and Restaurant and Le Manhattan Bistro in Wilkes-Barre, Grico's Restaurant in Exeter, Back Mountain wedding venue Friedman Farms and the River Street Jazz Cafe in Plains Township. Second lawsuit filed over escalator injuries at Boscov's January 16, 2020 WILKES-BARRE — A Hanover Township man has sued Boscov's, claiming he was injured when the store's escalator violently sped up. It is the second such suit filed against the store since October. Joseph Ferraro and his wife, Maria, filed the suit against the department store chain Thursday, claiming he was injured inside the store's Wilkes-Barre location after a mechanical failure of an escalator. The suit also names the Schindler Elevator Corp. as a defendant. According to the suit, which was filed through Ferraro's attorney, Angel Mae Webby-Zola of the West Hazleton Zola Law Offices, the Ferraros were at the store on Oct. 9, 2019. While there, Ferraro claims he was standing on the escalator when it "violently sped up,” causing Ferraro to fall backward. He says the teeth of the escalator continuously dug into his bag, causing damage to both his body and his clothing. Ferraro is seeking compensation in excess of $50,000, saying he had to undergo "great pain and agony” and incurred extensive physical therapy and other medical bills. Notably, Ferraro's injuries occurred the day after Webby-Zola filed a very similar suit against Boscov's on behalf of Viola Shemanski, who claimed she was also thrown from an escalator. In Shemanski's account, the escalator also suddenly sped up, throwing her from it. She fell, causing a head injury and a broken rib. It is not immediately clear from the suits if Ferraro and Shemanski were injured on the same escalator, or if multiple escalators in the store have had the same mechanical failure. Attempts to reach both Webby-Zola and Boscov's for comment were not successful Thursday afternoon. Police chief sues Exeter Twp. over pressure to issue tickets January 16, 2020 EXETER TWP. — The police chief of Exeter Township has filed a suit in federal court against the township, claiming he was pressured to illegally force the department to issue more traffic tickets. The suit comes from Chief William Knowles, Cpl. Charles Neff and Sgt. Scott Viadock, and was filed earlier this month by Pittston-based attorney Cynthia L. Pollick. According to the suit, Exeter Township Supervisor Daniel Fetch repeatedly directed the police department begin issuing more traffic tickets. Fetch allegedly also said he wanted to hire more young officers, with the suit's plaintiffs claiming Fetch made comments that new officers would be more willing to listen to this directive. According to the officers, the suggestions from Fetch first began on Feb. 22, 2019, with Fetch allegedly telling Knowles that he "wanted police officers to write more tickets.” The suit says this is illegal and official misconduct. On the same day, Knowles says he told Fetch that he cannot order officers to write more tickets. Knowles contacted other members of township government, including Chairman Robert Kile Sr. and solicitor Gene Molino. Afterward, Fetch allegedly threatened to transfer Knowles on March 1. On March 14, Kile issued a directive that no one on the board of supervisors could not perform on-the-spot or impromptu disciplinary actions against police officers. However, the officers in the suit claim this did not stop Fetch, with Fetch allegedly threatening to move Neff off his normal shift should he continue to refuse to issue more tickets. On April 1, Fetch allegedly stated "he wanted younger cadets since they would have no issue writing a ton of tickets.” The officers went to Exeter Township about Fetch's conduct on May 6, with Kile saying Fetch was "on his own” should the officers pursue further action. On July 1, Fetch, continuing this line of dialog, allegedly told Knowles that "if the township hired young kids out of the academy, they would write everyone up for everything related to traffic citations and hit traffic hard.” Knowles took this as an implication that he should be writing more tickets. In the fall, Fetch told officers that the township would be putting up a new traffic signal and that officers "would be writing a lot more red-light tickets.” The officers filed the suit in federal court, claiming that Fetch's alleged threats to transfer officers to other shifts for speaking out amount to a violation of their First Amendment rights. "Defendants have intimidated Plaintiffs and have affected the way they perform their work duties because of their reporting of official misconduct and corruption,” the suit reads. The officers are seeking an unspecified amount in damages. Attempts to reach Exeter Township for comment were not immediately successful Thursday afternoon. Weis debuts new Dallas store with 'dollar zone,' donations January 16, 2020 DALLAS TWP. — The new Weis Market in the Country Club Shopping Center will be "clean, well-organized and very friendly,” store manager Carmine Lupio said Thursday. Lupio will be pleased, then, to hear what one Weis shopper had to say when the Times Leader asked what she thought of the new store. "I find this store to be very clean, very well-organized and very friendly,” said Ann Kay of Dallas. Weis Markets opened its newest location Thursday in the former Thomas Foodtown, which it purchased in September. Weis also acquired Thomas' Food Basics store in Shavertown, which was then closed. Lupio said the new store occupies 45,000 square feet and employs 45 full- and part-time associates. Half of the employees at the new store came to Weis from the former Thomas' locations, corporate spokesman Dennis Curtain said. It also includes a "dollar zone,” the first such discount section at a Weis store. The supermarket on Tunkhannock Highway marks the seventh Luzerne County location for the Sunbury-based chain — and Weis' second store in the Dallas area, albeit less than two miles from an existing Weis store on the Memorial Highway. Both stores will remain open, Curtin said, noting that the company saw an opportunity to expand its business in the Back Mountain by opening the new market. "We are confident we will do even better thanks to our loyal customer base,” Curtin said. The chain's other Luzerne County locations are in Plains Township, Nanticoke, Mountain Top, Duryea, and West Hazleton. What started as a neighborhood market in Sunbury in 1912 is now a seven-state chain with 198 stores, 126 of them in Pennsylvania. Weis has undergone substantial growth and expansion in recent years in the Mid-Atlantic region, as the Central Penn Business Journal pointed out in a 2017 report, opening a new flagship superstore in suburban Harrisburg following a year in which Weis spent $65 million on buying stores from rival companies. The company also makes a point of supporting community organizations, a policy continued Thursday as the Dallas ceremony included donations to two Back Mountain charities — Blue Chip Farm Animal Refuge and the Back Mountain Food Pantry, each receiving a check for $500. "This donation is very much appreciated,” said Marge Bart, owner of Blue Chip Farms. "It really helps us survive. We recently received two dogs that were pregnant and needed C-sections. That's a big and unexpected expense.” Blue Chip Farm Animal Refuge has provided thousands of animals a sanctuary where older, stray, abandoned, sick or abused animals can wait to be adopted, or simply live out their lives in safety and peace. Joseph Hardisky, associate manager of the Back Mountain Food Pantry — located in the Trucksville United Methodist Church — said the food pantry serves about 185 people and he said the number of people in need is always growing. "We see people who have recently lost jobs or found out they have a serious illness,” Hardisky said. "They suddenly find themselves in a tough position and they come to us for help.” For Lupio, a 12-year Weis employee, those donations also meant a great deal. "It's a good feeling to work for a company that gives back to the community so much,” he said. Retreat closure report draws strong reactions, mostly angry January 16, 2020 Reaction to the state Department of Corrections report recommending closure of the State Correctional Institution at Retreat may not have come as a surprise to many. Neither should the reactions — mostly angry — from political and union leaders who have been speaking out against such a move since the proposed closure was first announced last summer: • State Rep. Gerald Mullery, D-Newport Township, called the entire process "a charade.” And Mullery took his disappointment a step further, recommending that Department of Corrections Secretary John E. Wetzel be removed from Gov. Tom Wolf's cabinet. "I remain steadfast in my belief that (Wetzel) doesn't possess the temperament, professionalism, or competence to run a used car lot, let alone the DOC,” Mullery said. "I have genuine concern for the safety of all DOC personnel under his command.” DOC Executive Deputy Secretary for Institutional Operations Tabb Bickell was placed in charge of the process amid ongoing outrage over profane remarks made by Wetzel during a public hearing on plans to close the state prison, located in Newport Township. "We've known from the onset of this process that it was nothing more than a charade and violative of the spirit of Act 133,” Mullery said, referencing a law that requires closures of public institutions like correctional facilities to come after a period of public comment and investigation into the economic impact of the closure. • Larry Blackwell, president of the Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association, also referenced Wetzel in his statement on the report's recommendations. "Secretary Wetzel's comments caught on a microphone at the first SCI-Retreat hearing told us all we needed to know,” Blackwell said. "This process has been a sham from the beginning — and it's a dangerous one because it puts money over public safety.” Blackwell said Pennsylvania's prisons are bursting at the seams and are more violent than ever — "no matter how often the Department of Corrections manipulates its statistics on violence and inmate population.” Blackwell added, "It's time for the Pennsylvania General Assembly to hold this department accountable, or more prisons are going to close in their districts.” • C. David Pedri, Luzerne County manager, called the report "truly upsetting,” saying "it does not take into account the truly negative economic impact that this closure will have on Luzerne County and Newport Township.” "After review, it seems that the department made a decision first and then put together a report to back that decision,” Pedri added. "Our thoughts are with the many courageous employees who will now have to uproot their families and their way of life. I'm hopeful that Gov. Wolf changes course and chooses to keep SCI Retreat open.” A reversal from the governor seems unlikely. Mullery, among others, said he expects an announcement by week's end, and that "it appears he will move forward with his recommendation.” Social media also was filled with comments from readers weighing in on the report's conclusions, though not all were opposed. From the Times Leader Facebook page: • Jeremiah Scutt: "This is the right decision. Let's get that deathtrap closed and start housing them in the the brand new $400 million facility in Montgomery County. That is why it was built.” • Michael Li: "They never planned on keeping it open,” Li wrote, suggesting the decision to close was made back in August and calling the Act 133 process "a joke.” • Mary Lou Yerke: "Maybe the employees can ask the White House to intervene. After all he opened more mines (sarcasm) ... I feel for the employees and the effect it will have on the local economy. I hope all the employees can be placed in other reasonable distance positions.” Regarding the employees, Mullery said that once closure is finalized the state must focus on their transition to new facilities, adding that those who can't transition should receive education and/or career training. "Secondly, we need to assist the communities directly affected by this closure,” Mullery said. "I, along with a few colleagues and the governor, have begun preparing legislation directing assistance to employees and municipalities burdened by the closure of a large, state-run facility. I expect that legislation to be finalized and introduced shortly.” Mullery https://www.timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/web1_Mullery_Jerry_mug-cmyk-1.jpgMullery Pedri https://www.timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/web1_PedrinewCMYK-1.jpgPedri Blackwell https://www.timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/web1_TTL083019prison-meeting3-1.jpgBlackwell By Bill O'Boyle and Roger DuPuis boboyle@timesleader.com Reach Bill O'Boyle at 570-991-6118 or on Twitter @TLBillOBoyle. Police: Loaded firearms found with intoxicated man January 15, 2020 JACKSON TWP. — Township police arrested a Dallas man they say was intoxicated inside a truck that contained firearms, ammunition and beer on Tuesday. Police said they found three loaded handguns and an unloaded handgun inside a Dodge truck occupied by Donald Joseph Scavone, 25, of Meeker Outlet Road. Scavone does not have a conceal weapons permit to possess the handguns, police said. Scavone was arraigned Wednesday in Luzerne County Central Court on three counts of firearms not to be carried without a permit and two counts of driving under the influence. He was released without bail. According to the criminal complaint: Police were patrolling in the area of Hillside Avenue and Cobblestone Lane when they spotted a Dodge truck parked off the side at about 11:58 p.m. Scavone was found slumped over the steering wheel and had trouble waking up. When Scavone exited the vehicle, police noticed an open can of beer in the center cup holder. Police said Scavone reeked of an alcoholic beverage and had to lean against the truck to maintain his balance, the complaint says. Scavone allegedly told police he consumed two beers. Full and empty beer cans were found inside the truck, police said. Police searched the truck allegedly finding two loaded handguns under the driver's seat, an unloaded handgun under the passenger seat and a loaded handgun inside the center console. Ammunition was also found under the passenger seat. Scavone told police he was searching for his girlfriend at several taverns and was on his way to a friend's house, the complaint says. Police said in the complaint a breath test showed Scavone had an alcohol level of 0.163%. — Staff report https://www.timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/web1_blottericon.-5.jpg House approves bill that would halt closure of White Haven, Polk centers January 15, 2020 WILKES-BARRE — The Pennsylvania House of Representatives Wednesday passed Senate Bill 906 that would prohibit the closure of White Haven State Center and Polk State Center. The House voted 139-55 to advance the legislation. It now returns to the Senate for approval. "This bill, as amended, does exactly what Gov. Tom Wolf and his Council on Reform should have done from the start, before moving to close these centers,” said Rep. Gerald Mullery, D-Newport Township. "It corrects his mistake and ensures all avenues will be explored before making such a critical decision.” Under S.B. 906, a moratorium would be enacted on the scheduled closing of White Haven Center in Luzerne County and Polk Center in Venango County. The House further amended the bill to include the appointment of a task force which will evaluate the state centers and provide recommendations to the Department of Human Services prior to the closure of one or more state centers. Sen. John Yudichak, I-Swoyersville, thanked Rep. Lee James and the members of the Luzerne County House Delegation, both Republican and Democrat, who he said fought hard to advance Senate Bill 906. "The passage of SB 906 is a significant victory for people with intellectual disabilities, the families that love them and the dedicated employees who provide loving care to them at our state centers,” Yudichak said. "I look forward to working with Sen. Michele Brooks, Sen. Scott Hutchinson, Sen. Lisa Baker and my other Senate colleagues to concur on the House amendment and send Senate Bill 906 to the governor for his signature.” Yudichak introduced Senate Bill 906 with Brooks, R-Jamestown; Hutchinson, R-Oil City, and Baker, R-Lehman Township. As amended by the House, the bill creates the Task Force on the Closure of State Facilities to analyze and manage the closure of any state center and prevents a closure of those centers for a minimum of five years. "I am pleased to see my colleagues on both sides of the aisle recognized the importance of protecting hundreds of residents, their families and their caregivers,” Mullery said. Baker echoed these sentiments in a statement Wednesday. "This is an important step toward recognizing the rights of the residents of the two institutions, their families, and the workers, who deserve a more deliberative process in deciding their future,” she stated. "There is a larger principle at stake as well. Legislators have a role in establishing, funding, and overseeing state institutions. That involvement does not suddenly terminate because a governor arbitrarily decides to pursue closure.” State Rep. Tarah Toohil, R-Butler Township, called Wednesday's vote "a huge victory the White Haven Center and its residents.” "These individuals and their families deserve to have a state center safety net. The intellectually disabled deserve a choice in the type of care and housing they are afforded,” Toohil said. The White Haven and Polk centers serve individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities — 111 in the case of White Haven, many of whom have lived there for decades. White Haven also has 429 employees. In October, Luzerne County Council declared its opposition to the White Haven State Center shutdown, passing a resolution supporting the Senate bill.

Arena authority approves budget, projects profit January 15, 2020 WILKES-BARRE TWP. — The Luzerne County Convention Center Authority on Wednesday approved its annual budget and projected an approximate 10% increase in net income from operations compared to last year. At its monthly meeting at the Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza, authority Chairman Gary Zingaretti focused on the net income entry of $332,115. The prior year's figure was $303,059 and did not include the non-operating income from the county's hotel tax that goes toward the payment of the bonds issued for construction of the facility that opened in 1999 and for the county's tourism bureau. The hotel tax is budgeted to bring in $2.4 million in revenue this year. When factored in with other non-operating revenue, expense and depreciation, the budget projects a net income of $729,777 compared to $759,030 for 2019. Zingaretti noted that the budget includes the naming rights contract, the lease with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins hockey franchise, the management contract ASM Global and the new food and beverage agreements. "We feel this accurately represents all the contractual changes and there's certainly some things that will still need to play out as we're in the first year of this contract to see how everything goes,” Zingaretti said. The much anticipated WiFi project is moving closer to actual installation of the custom-made system, said Donna Cupinski, chairwoman of the authority's Capital Improvements & Strategic Planning Committee. "All the equipment is on order. There's stuff that (Turn-Key Technologies Inc. does) at their home office to prep for this, so they're not on site yet. But we anticipate them being on site in February,” Cupinski said. The authority also approved several other expenditures: • Hiring an engineering and architectural firm at a cost not to exceed $50,000 for future projects that are expected to be funded by state grants. The grants would cover the cost of hiring the firm, Zingaretti said. • A new computer server at a cost not to exceed $20,000. • A new digital mix board at a cost not to exceed $3,500 to replace the 20-year-old, analog mixing board for the portable sound system. The authority unanimously voted 10-0 to retain its leadership for this year: Zingaretti, chairman; Cupinski, vice chairman; Tony Ryba, treasurer; and Tom Woods, secretary. Ryba did not attend Wednesday's meeting. After adjourning the meeting the authority met in an executive session to discuss a personnel matter, Zingaretti said. The authority's next meeting will be at noon on Feb. 12.

WVW votes to keep tax hike within limit, but faces big shortfall in budget January 15, 2020 KINGSTON — Wyoming Valley West School Board voted unanimously to keep any property tax increase within a state-set limit, but business consultant Joe Rodriguez said the district had little choice. Calculations done by the business office showed the district would not qualify for either of two state-allowed exceptions to exceed the limit. The limit was set by the state law known as Act 1 of 2006, which authorized the use of money from legalized gambling to help offset homeowner property taxes through a "homestead exemption. The stat annually sets a maximum tax hike for all districts. Wyoming Valley West's limit this year is 3.7%. Districts can only exceed the limit, known as the Act 1 Index, by either getting voter approval in the spring primary via a referendum, or by getting exceptions allowed by the state for a limited number of reasons. Rodriguez, who worked as the business manager for years but has been offering free consulting services since retirement, said the district looked into applying for exceptions for rapidly rising special education costs or to cover escalating retirement contribution costs. "After we looked at the numbers, we didn't qualify for either,” he said. Voting to stay within the limit gives the district more time to draw up a preliminary budget, and Rodriguez said it's too early to tell what staying within the limit will mean, but early numbers suggest a steep shortfall between revenue and spending without exceeding the limit. The board will have to find savings before the end of June, the legal deadline for passing a balanced budget. Near the end of the meeting, Board President Joe Mazur pointed to two agenda items that he said shows the budget problems the district faces. Abiding by court orders, the board had to approve tax refunds to HCSC Laundry totaling $39,495 and refunds to Platinum Health at River Run LLC totaling $146,868. Both orders came as a result of tax assessment appeals for the years of 2016, 2017 and 2018. After the meeting, Rodriguez offered data that he said shows that assessed property values in the district have dropped by $65 million in the last nine years. https://www.timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/web1_Wyoming-Valley-West.jpg By Mark Guydish mguydish@timesleader.com Reach Mark Guydish at 570-991-6112 or on Twitter @TLMarkGuydish VIDEO: WB police reach out to Rolling Mill Hill residents January 15, 2020 WILKES-BARRE — The Residents' Association of Rolling Mill Hill held their monthly meeting Wednesday night with multiple topics of discussion, including police statistics, aggressive driving in the neighborhood and illegal street parking. The meeting was run by association president Linda Joseph, who offered snacks and refreshments to the crowd of neighborhood residents before turning the meeting over Wilkes-Barre City Councilman Tony Brooks. Brooks didn't have too much to say, opting to let the evening's two guest speakers do the talking. He did add that "the city can't do everything, so if we could pitch in and help out, it would be great.” Wilkes-Barre Police Chief Joe Coffay and Community Policing Officer Kirk Merchel addressed the crowd for over an hour, answering questions and letting the people know where the police stand with major issues in Wilkes-Barre. "When I took over a year ago, it was at this meeting that I said I wanted to make some changes,” said Coffay. He brought along some statistics so citizens could better understand the scope of the work he's done as chief. In December of 2019 alone, according to Coffay, Wilkes-Barre police responded to almost 4,000 calls to service. Of those calls, about 340 turned into actual cases on which police were able to follow up. Coffay also lauded the work of his Anti-Crime Unit for helping get drug and violent offenders off the streets. The unit made 149 felony drug arrests and took multiple firearms off the street, including three weapons from a juvenile offender that Cofay referred to as "Wilkes-Barre public enemy No. 1.” "I'm very proud of the work our police officers have done,” said Coffay. Merchel focused primarily on the work police have done in responding to some of the minor crimes piling up around town. "Everything has to be taken care of, we can't just let the minor crimes go,” Merchel said. "All of these minor things lead to bigger things.” Merchel highlighted the department's use of social media as a highly effective tool, saying that many arrests have been made based off of tips from Facebook users who identify suspects based on images that the department uploads to its Facebook page. He also confirmed that the department would be expanding onto Twitter this year. After Merchel's comments were concluded, the floor was opened to Rolling Mill Hills residents, who seemed to have a lot of similar things to say, mainly regarding speeding and parking in the city. Citizens cited roadways like Hazle and Blackman streets as places where motorists regularly push speed limits. After the event had concluded, Coffay and Merchel were both feeling positive. "Now, we take all the information and concerns, and we take action on it,” said Coffay. "I thought this meeting went very well.” Duane Lindbuchler, a member of the residents association, felt the same way. A longtime resident of Wilkes-Barre, Lindbuchler says that he's noticed the change in the city since Coffay took over as chief. "I walk my dog every night, and four or five years ago I would have been nervous,” Lindbuchler said. "Now, especially in the last year or so, you could feel the difference.” Wilkes-Barre City Councilman Tony Brooks, standing, addresses the crowd while Wilkes-Barre police Chief Joe Coffay, left, Officer Kirk Merchel and Rolling Mill Hill Residents' Association president Linda Joseph look on at Wednesday night's monthly meeting. https://www.timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/web1_Rolling-Mill-Hills-2.jpgWilkes-Barre City Councilman Tony Brooks, standing, addresses the crowd while Wilkes-Barre police Chief Joe Coffay, left, Officer Kirk Merchel and Rolling Mill Hill Residents' Association president Linda Joseph look on at Wednesday night's monthly meeting.

Andre Fuller, 29, was found convicted of two felony counts of making terroristic threats on Wednesday, after having been on trial before Luzerne County President Judge Michael T. Vough since the beginning of the week. Fuller, who was on parole for the 2013 attempted homicide of then 19-year-old William Uggiano, was arrested in September 2019 after Kingston police say a woman came to the police station to report the threats. The woman, who is not identified by name in court records, told police she had previously been in a relationship with Fuller, and that Fuller had been making threats of violence against her and her current boyfriend. The woman provided the text message thread between herself and Fuller, which implied that he could have people do harm to her boyfriend. He also sent her photos of a pistol, saying, "I got one too but I use mine.” Fuller also texted the woman, saying that her new boyfriend should change the color of his vehicle, because Fuller would be looking for it. Court records show that, after jurors completed their deliberation Wednesday, Vough scheduled sentencing for March 25. The sentence could be harsh, since the threats were made while Fuller was on parole for the attempted homicide of Uggiano. Fuller entered a guilty plea in that case in July 2014. Fuller was accused of firing seven shots at Uggiano, striking him in the head, shoulder, arm, hip, waist and buttocks. Uggiano testified he had gone to the area of Wayne and South Grant streets to meet a woman who had invited him to smoke some marijuana. He said he waited about 10 minutes, then began to walk home when he turned around and saw Fuller with a gun. That's when Fuller opened fire, Uggiano said. Fuller was sentenced by Luzerne County Judge David W. Lupas to spend between six and 12 years in state prison for that crime. https://www.timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/web1_gavel-4.jpeg By Patrick Kernan pkernan@timesleader.com Reach Patrick Kernan at 570-991-6386 or on Twitter @PatKernan Angels & Airwaves postpones Kirby Center show January 15, 2020 WILKES-BARRE — The rock band Angels & Airwaves has postponed the second leg of their winter tour, including Sunday's performance at the F.M.

As it stands right now, Saturday afternoon is expected to see a burst of snowfall possibly mixed in with some sleet, before giving way to mixed precipitation on Saturday night. Joanne LaBounty, a forecaster with the National Weather Service, doesn't expect much in the way of delays or travel issues, but the possibility of sleet can make any weekend travel a little tricky. "We could see some sleet mixed in with the snow during the day on Saturday,” LaBounty said. "Still, it all comes down to whether or not the roads are treated properly.” LaBounty says that the Luzerne County area could see up to 3 to 4 inches of snowfall on Saturday, with temperatures hovering in the mid-30s before dropping below freezing on Saturday night. "The high temperatures during the afternoon should prevent the roads from freezing over,” LaBounty said. It's still a little far out to predict just exactly what's going to happen, but the early prediction will allow for residents and travelers to make preparations for the possibility of snowfall. In addition, the National Weather Service has issued a wind advisory for Thursday from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., with a slight chance of less than an inch of snow falling Thursday night. Gusts are expected to be consistently from 10 to 20 miles per hour, with some gusts reaching as high as 40 miles per hour.

Aimee Dilger|Times Leader By Kevin Carroll kcarroll@timesleader.com DOC report recommends closing of SCI Retreat January 15, 2020 WILKES-BARRE — The Pennsylvania Department of Corrections issued a report Wednesday morning that recommends the closing of the State Correctional Institution at Retreat. Three local state senators then issued a terse statement, which included calling on Gov. Tom Wolf to reject the recommendation and keep the facility open. The full report can be found here. A news release issued by the DOC stated: "Department of Corrections Executive Deputy Secretary Tabb Bickell announced today that the Department of Corrections submitted its SCI Retreat final report to Gov. Tom Wolf and the minority and majority leaders of both the House and Senate. That final report recommends the closure of the facility. "A final decision will be forthcoming.” State Sens. John Yudichak, I-Swoyersville; Lisa Baker, R-Lehman Township; and John Gordner, R-Berwick, issued a joint statement following the announcement. "We stand with the brave men and women who have given their heart and soul working at SCI Retreat and the communities of Luzerne County. We vehemently disagree with the findings made in the report by the Department of Corrections to recommend the closure of SCI Retreat. "Act 133 of 2018 was enacted to ensure that any prison closure would be thoroughly vetted in an open and transparent manner. The Department of Corrections clearly gave less than a good faith effort during the hearing process, and we do not believe it was fair to the workers of SCI Retreat, their families or the communities of Luzerne County. "As we have done in the past, we stand in a bipartisan manner to call upon Gov. Wolf to reject the findings made in this report and keep SCI Retreat open.” State Rep. Gerald Mullery, D-Newport Township, addressed the closure via Twitter, including a video of past meetings on SCI Retreat and protests to keep it open. "We have an obligation to explore all of our options and protect our residents, their families and caregivers,” Mullery tweeted. The DOC report was compiled after two public hearings were held to discuss the impact closing the facility would have on the host municipality and the region. The hearings were held as a requirement of Act 133. The DOC report details why the department has decided to recommend closing the prison that houses more than 1,000 inmates and has 384 full-time employees. In the executive summary of the report, it is stated that the DOC continues to experience a significant decrease in the inmate population. "In fact, a reduction of 1,900 inmates in fiscal year 2018/2019 was the largest one-year decrease in the Department's history — all at a time when crime rates continue to fall,” the report states. "Furthermore, current population projections anticipate a continued decline in the prison population over the next five years.” At the same time, the DOC says it is also faced with the challenge of a projected budget deficit of approximately $140 million for fiscal year 2019/2020. As a result of that significant budget deficit and continued decrease in the inmate population, the DOC said it would be fiscally irresponsible not to consider a facility closure. "The DOC is able to continue to prioritize the safety of staff, inmates and the community in addition to remaining a good steward of taxpayer money,” the report states. The report goes on to say that the Justice Reinvestment (JRI) Act, along with the closures of SCIs Cresson, Greensburg, and Pittsburgh provided a "cost avoidance” to the Department of $543 million. "This report will show that the DOC considered all appropriate and relevant factors in reaching its final recommendation. The DOC formally organized the closure steering committee on Aug. 26, 2019. The report further states that SCI Retreat has significant physical plant and infrastructure concerns where renovation and upgrades are needed to preserve the operations of the facility. Specifically, a structural inspection of the access bridge over the Susquehanna River has recently identified structural deficiencies that are in need of immediate repair, the report states. An expenditure of $15-$20 million for a full replacement of the bridge in the next 10-15 years is recommended by PennDOT — $1 million would be required to paint the bridge to prevent further corrosive damage. The bridge was previously painted in 1993. As far as the loss of revenue to the Shickshinny Municipal Authority, the report calls for a $32,000/quarter usage fee. The DOC is committed to paying a quarterly usage fee for a period of 5 years from the closure date. The report estimates that annual mothballing costs for the facility will total $1.2 million, including minimal utility services to maintain the facility as well as contracted operations for the boiler plant and security to oversee the closed facility. The report states the ability to offer positions in Northeast Pennsylvania will minimize the economic impact to this area and potential negative impacts to families. "The selection of SCI Retreat is the least impactful selection of the DOC facilities because it is one of the oldest facilities and presents significant physical plant challenges,” the report states. "It provides the most reasonable relocation options for staff with SCIs Dallas, Mahanoy, Frackville, Coal Township, Muncy, and Waymart available within 65 miles of SCI Retreat.” On Dec. 20, the office of Gov. Tom Wolf announced that the decision on SCI Retreat would not come until sometime after the first of the year. In August, Wolf's administration and the Department of Corrections announced their current proposal to close SCI-Retreat. DOC Executive Deputy Secretary for Institutional Operations Tabb Bickell was placed in charge of the process amid ongoing outrage over profane remarks made by DOC Secretary John Wetzel during a public hearing on plans to close the state prison, located in Newport Township. In November, a meeting was held at the Newport Township Municipal Building that was attended by Sen. John Yudichak, I-Swoyersville, and representatives of Sen. Lisa Baker, R-Lehman Township; Rep. Gerald Mullery, D-Newport Township; Shickshinny Borough and Sewer Authority and Conyngham Township. Yudichak said Bickell and DOC officials attended the meeting, along with representatives of the Department of Community and Economic Development and the Department of Environmental Protection. "It was a very positive meeting,” Yudichak said at the time. "We provided detailed information on the devastating impact that closing SCI Retreat would have on the community.” After that meeting, Yudichak said a strong argument was made by the Shickshinny Sewer Authority, which expanded its facility to accommodate the prison. He said if the prison closes, the authority would have to raise rates significantly, putting a severe financial burden on users. Yudichak also said Newport Township would face cutting its police department because of the loss of revenue. "Newport Township would lose cops on the street,” Yudichak said. We have an obligation to explore all of our options and protect our residents, their families and caregivers. #PeopleFirst #WHCStrong pic.twitter.com/DbeyAAq5yJ— Rep. Gerald Mullery (@RepJerryMullery) January 15, 2020 The bridge leading to SCI-Retreat recently underwent an inspection around the same time the meeting was held. During the initial stages of the process, the DOC pledged to offer SCI 's employees positions at about a half-dozen other state prisons that are within 65 miles if the facility does close.

Gerald Mullery Monday expressed his disappointment over a Department of Corrections report recommending the closure of the State Correctional Institution at Retreat, calling the entire process "a charade.” And Mullery, D-Newport Township, took his disappointment a step further — recommending that Department of Corrections Secretary John E. Wetzel be removed from Gov. Tom Wolf's cabinet. "I remain steadfast in my belief that (Wetzel) doesn't possess the temperament, professionalism, or competence to run a used car lot, let alone the DOC,” Mullery said. "I have genuine concern for the safety of all DOC personnel under his command.” DOC Executive Deputy Secretary for Institutional Operations Tabb Bickell was placed in charge of the process amid ongoing outrage over profane remarks made by DOC Secretary John Wetzel during a public hearing on plans to close the state prison, located in Newport Township. Regarding the announcement to close the facility, Mullery said there were no surprises contained in the DOC report or recommendations. "We've known from the onset of this process that it was nothing more than a charade and violative of the spirit of Act 133,” Mullery said. Mullery said he recently met privately with Gov. Wolf and discussed the impact of this proposed closure. "But it appears he will move forward with his recommendation,” Mullery said. "I expect an announcement by week's end.” Mullery said once the closure is finalized, the next step to be taken will be to focus on the displaced employees and ensure their transition to new facilities is expeditious and safe. For those who cannot undertake a transition, Mullery said the state must offer assistance in the form of education and/or career training. "Secondly, we need to assist the communities directly affected by this closure,” Mullery said. "I, along with a few colleagues and the governor, have begun preparing legislation directing assistance to employees and municipalities burdened by the closure of a large, state-run facility. I expect that legislation to be finalized and introduced shortly.” PSCOA responds Pennsylvania State Corrections Officers Association (PSCOA) President Larry Blackwell issued a statement on the decision by the DOC to close SCI-Retreat: "Secretary Wetzel's comments caught on a microphone at the first SCI-Retreat hearing told us all we needed to know,” Blackwell said. "This process has been a sham from the beginning — and it's a dangerous one because it puts money over public safety.” Blackwell said Pennsylvania's prisons are bursting at the seams and are more violent than ever — "no matter how often the Department of Corrections manipulates its statistics on violence and inmate population.” Blackwell added, "It's time for the Pennsylvania General Assembly to hold this department accountable, or more prisons are going to close in their districts.” Pedri: 'Truly upsetting' Luzerne County Manager C. David Pedri said this about the report: "The report Department of Corrections is truly upsetting as it does not take into account the truly negative economic impact that this closure will have on Luzerne County and Newport Township. "After review, it seems that the Department made a decision first and then put together a report to back that decision. "Our thoughts are with the many courageous employees who will now have to uproot their families and their way of life. I'm hopeful that Gov. Wolf changes course and chooses to keep SCI Retreat open.” Blackwell https://www.timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/web1_TTL083019prison-meeting3.jpgBlackwell Pedri https://www.timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/web1_PedrinewCMYK.jpgPedri Mullery https://www.timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/web1_Mullery_Jerry_mug-cmyk.jpgMullery By Bill O'Boyle boboyle@timesleader.com Reach Bill O'Boyle at 570-991-6118 or on Twitter @TLBillOBoyle. Police: Illinois fugitive captured in UberEats car January 15, 2020 WILKES-BARRE — City police arrested a man they say is wanted in Illinois from a vehicle parked the wrong way on Tuesday. Robert Totra, 25, of Waterloo, Ill, was a passenger in a Subaru that was parked facing the wrong direction and impeded traffic in the 300 block of Hazle Street. Police said the female driver, Olivia C. Popov, 28, of Chicago, Ill, claimed she was an UberEats driver. A records check showed Totra is wanted by the Monroe County Sheriff's Department in Illinois on allegations he failed to appear for a sentencing hearing on drug offenses. An online court docket from Monroe County, Ill, indicates Totra was scheduled to be sentenced Aug. 1, 2019 after he pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of a controlled substance. According to the criminal complaints: Police spotted the parked Subaru with an out of state license plate parked the wrong way and impeding traffic at about 6 p.m. Officers detected a strong odor of marijuana emitting from the vehicle. Totra claimed he did not have any photo identification. When Totra exited the vehicle, an officer observed him attempt to hide something under the front passenger seat. Police said they recovered a bag from under the seat allegedly containing marijuana. Police later found a wallet in Totra's pocket with his driver's license, and a fanny pack Totra had around him contained methamphetamine, two prescription tablets and 10 THC cartridges, the complaint says. THC is an ingredient in marijuana. Totra was arraigned Wednesday in Luzerne County Central Court on charges of possession of a controlled substance, possession of drug paraphernalia and fugitive from justice. He was jailed at the county correctional facility for lack of $30,000 total bail. A preliminary hearing on the drug possession charge is scheduled Jan. 21 and an extradition hearing is scheduled in county court Jan. 24. Popov was cited with a summary offense of drug paraphernalia. https://www.timesleader.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/web1_handcuffs_2-3.jpg By Ed Lewis elewis@timesleader.com Weis Markets to host grand opening Thursday at new Dallas store January 15, 2020 DALLAS — Weis Markets Thursday is opening a new location in Dallas in the Country Club Shopping Center and the company will present donations to local causes.

West Pittston man charged with unlawful contact with girl January 15, 2020 WEST PITTSTON — A man from West Pittston vomited during a break in an interview with police about his alleged sexual grooming of a girl, according to court records. Andrew Anthony Terek, 28, of Race Street, was arraigned Tuesday night on charges he had unlawful contact with the girl and sent her sexually explicit messages on social media. According to the criminal complaint: The mother of the girl spoke with police on Nov. 1 regarding a man, identified as Terek, sending messages to her daughter. Police reviewed the messages including one from Terek asking the girl to meet him on tracks on Luzerne Avenue. Terek indicated in the message he wanted to give the girl a necklace as an apology for putting her into a stressful situation, the complaint says. Police spotted Terek on the tracks and asked him why he was in the area. Terek responded he was on his way to a restaurant to pick up a menu but police said the eatery was closed at the time. Terek voluntarily agreed to speak with officers about an incident After police briefly told Terek about why they wanted to question him, Terek went into a restroom and was overheard throwing up and gagging. When the interview resumed, Terek admitted to having sexual conversations with the girl and asking her to have sex. He told police he pressed his genitals against the girl's buttocks on Oct. 29, and sent the girl a picture of a penis he copied from the internet because "He was embarrassed of how small his penis was,” the complaint says. The girl told police Terek added her as a friend on "Snapchat” on Oct. 18, a date she remembered because it was at a football game between Pittston Area and Wyoming Area. She claimed Terek told her he was 16-years-old. Police said the girl reported "all he wanted was sex from me and there was times all I wanted to do was talk,” the complaint says. When they met on Oct. 29, the girl said Terek begged to have sex and turned her around pressing his genitals against her buttocks. She admitted to sending four sexually explicit videos to Terek on Snapchat. Police said the girl was questioned by a forensic interviewer at the Luzerne County Children's Advocacy Center. Police said Terek in messages he sent the girl requested her to send him sexually explicit pictures and videos. In several of the messages, Terek called the girl "My baby,” the complaint says. Terek was arraigned by District Judge Joseph Halesey in Hanover Township on two counts of unlawful contact with a minor and one count each of corruption of minors and criminal use of communication facility. He was jailed at the Luzerne County Correctional Facility for lack of $100,000 bail.

Josue Valdez, 30, of Grant Street, had a blood-alcohol level of 0.128% when his 2008 Honda became airborne while traveling over the Ashley Plane Bridge on North Main Street in Ashley on April 8, 2018. The car veered into oncoming traffic and collided with an unmarked Ashley cruiser, injuring Patrolman Joshua Smith and Sgt. Joseph McGlynn, according to court records. Smith and McGlynn were treated at Wilkes-Barre General Hospital. An officer from Sugar Notch detected an odor of an alcoholic beverage emitting from Valdez. A bottle of whiskey that was nearly empty was recovered from Valdez's vehicle, court records say. Valdez failed a series of field sobriety tests at the scene. He was treated at Wilkes-Barre General Hospital where a blood test revealed his alcohol level. Hanover Township police investigated the crash. Court records say Valdez pleaded guilty to driving under the influence of alcohol and driving with a suspended license on Nov. 12. Luzerne County Senior Judge Joseph M. Augello on Friday sentenced Valdez to six months in the county's Intermediate Punishment Program with the first five days on house arrest with electronic monitoring and perform 15 hours of community service.

Isaiah Humphries, who was recruited by Penn State but eventually left the program, is suing Franklin and ex-teammate Damion Barber. All-America linebacker Michah Parsons is also mentioned as a participant in the suit, along with NFL-bound defensive end Yetur Gross-Matos and linebacker Jesse Luketa. However, these players are not named as defendants. Among Humphries claims in the suit are that Barber, Parsons, Gross-Matos and Luketa would wrestle under classmen to the ground and while holding them there "place his genitals on the face of the lower classman” and place "their penises between the cheeks of the buttocks of lower classmen, such as the plaintiff, while naked in the locker-room shower. " The players also allegedly made reference to former coach Jerry Sandusky, who is serving a lengthy jail sentence for sexually abusing boys involved in his charity. The suit, which was filed by Humphries through his attorneys Steven F. Marino and Joseph Auddino of the Philadelphia-based law firm Marino Associates, states Humphries joined the team after being awarded a full athletic scholarship to the university in late 2017, beginning at the school for the 2018-19 academic year. Penn State issued a statement Tuesday saying its Office of Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response and the Office of Student Conduct investigated, and that Penn State police turned over results of its own investigation to Centre County District Attorney Bernie F. Cantorna. "The DA reviewed the case and decided that no charges would be pursued,” the school said. "No claims of hazing were substantiated against anyone.” A message was left seeking comment from Cantorna. Beginning in January 2018, the suit says, Humphries was made victim to rounds of hazing which he says were "orchestrated” by Barber, Parsons, Gross-Matos and Luketa. The suit says the hazing rituals included the aforementioned "organizers” saying they would make the lower classmen "their (expletive) because this is a prison.” The suit goes on to say the defendant and the participants explicitly threatened sexual abuse, allegedly saying, "I am going to Sandusky you.” The participants allegedly forced contact on the lower classmen, including Humphries. Their actions allegedly "included the participants overpowering lower classmen, wrestling the lower classmen to the ground, and while maintaining a restraint of the lower classmen, another participant would present his penis close to the face of the lower classmen and stroke his genitalia, simulating the action of ejaculation.” The participants also allegedly placed their penises between the buttocks cheeks of lower classmen and on their faces. The suit says this behavior is a clear violation of both laws prohibiting hazing and Penn State's own anti-hazing policy. However, Humphries says when the alleged behavior was reported by his father, former Penn State and NFL player Leonard Humphries, to Franklin and other staff members, he was retaliated against and no other action was taken. In regards to the allegations against Franklin, Penn State responded, "Based on extensive interviews, we did not learn of any information that would substantiate the claims.” Barber did serve a one-game suspension for what Franklin called a "violation of team rules,” missing the 2019 opener against Idaho. Asked to clarify further on Tuesday in light of the lawsuit, Penn State responded, "The discipline of individual students is generally a confidential matter consistent with federal law.” Humphries claims he was forced to participate in drills that were designed for him to fail. That failure, in turn, was used as an excuse to keep him from playing. He also claims he was denied medication from the coaching staff he needed to treat anxiety and narcolepsy. Additionally, Luketa allegedly threatened to have Humphries gunned down should he ever visit Luketa's Canadian hometown. Humphries is seeking an unspecified amount in damages in his suit. Current Penn State players took to social media to respond to the allegations. "Lying,” safety Lamont Wade wrote on Twitter, "looking for attention....” "I hope y'all don't believe that nonsense,” defensive tackle Fred Hansard wrote. "This is a real brotherhood over here! We would never do anything to jeopardize our future. The only thing we are focused on is winning this National Championship next year. Lil dude I just want you to know that KARMA is real my friend!” "I don't speak out often, but not going to sit here quietly while (Penn State football) is falsely being dragged through the mud by someone who quit on the program...” safety Garrett Taylor wrote. Humphries, who grew up in Texas, also played safety for Penn State, though he did not appear in any games while redshirting during the 2018 season. He ultimately transferred to Cal, announcing his departure in November 2018. "After many months of prayer and thought, I will be leaving Penn State,” Humphries wrote. "I'm so thankful for the coaches and the staff for allowing me to come here all the way from Texas. I have made many friends here that I will dearly miss and it's going to be hard to leave them here. "But in order to grow and not lose the passion that I have for football and for everything that I value. I unfortunate(ly) will be transferring from this place. I appreciate everything that has been given to me and the relationships that I have made along the way. Good luck to the Nittany Lions on their bowl (game).” The Associated Press contributed to this report. Read the suit here.

Police arrested Joseph Scott Daniel Bender, 23, of Defuniak Springs, Fla., after a records check showed he was wanted in Florida. Bender was one of three passengers inside an Acura driven by an Uber driver who was stopped in the area of Main and Northampton streets just after 12 a.m., according to court records. Bender was arraigned by District Judge Brian James Tupper in Luzerne County Central Court as a fugitive from justice. He was jailed at the county correctional facility without bail pending an extradition hearing in county court. Bender is listed as a sexual offender on the Florida Department of Law Enforcement's website. Online records from the Florida Department of Corrections indicate Bender was sentenced to two years in prison in June 2014 for molesting a person younger than 12-years-old in May 2013. Bender's status on Florida's sexual offender website is listed as 'absconded' as having no longer residing at the last reported address.
