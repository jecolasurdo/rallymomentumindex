One of the victims, librarian Cynthia Hurd, was a graduate of Clark Atlanta, earning a bachelor's degree from the institution in 1982 and a master's degree in 1989, university officials said. "Our hearts are especially heavy at the death of alumna Cynthia Hurd, one of nine killed by a senseless, hateful act of violence at Mother Emanuel AME Church,” read a statement from the school. Hurd, 54, was the manager of one of the busiest branches of the Charleston County library system.She and the eight other Emanuel AME parishioners were gunned down Wednesday night during Bible study by confessed killer Dylann Roof, 21. The Clark Atlanta vigil was set for 10 a.m. in the auditorium of Haven-Warren Hall. Support real journalism. Support local journalism. Subscribe to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution today. See offers.
