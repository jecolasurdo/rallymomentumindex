This past Monday in Virginia, a TIME Magazine photographer was assaulted by a Secret Service agent was who caught on camera slamming the journalist to the ground. Later that night in Georgia, the former host of "The Apprentice" instructed local authorities to remove 30 African-American students from the event, despite reports noting that they were "standing silently" by a set of bleachers. To make matters worse, the following day at a rally in Kentucky, a African-American female protester was physically assaulted by Trump supporters who were later identified as members of a local Neo-Nazi group. Despite the controversy, Trump is leading the GOP primary and is considered the inevitable nominee.
