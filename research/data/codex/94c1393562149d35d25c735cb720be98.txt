Standing there like a small mountain, he exudes a calm protective strength as his gaze searches the crowd. Also note his Bernie campaign name badge. Just who is this man? Gyasi Ross. He is a member of the Blackfeet Nation and Suqauamish Nation Territories, and he was there to hear Bernie Sanders speak because he supports Bernie for President. Yeah, I was that big-ass Native dude on stage. A Forrest Gump moment, a Kramer moment—damn, I wasn't trying to be there. But it was not a coincidence. KL and I understood that, whether we agreed with the young ladies' actions or not, there were two brown-skinned females on stage and a crowd of angry white folks, and history tells us that it's not unreasonable to expect the worst in these situations. [All bolding is in the original] In a guest editorial in The Stranger Slog, Gyasi Ross writes one of the most cogent and timely pieces that I have read on this incident and how we need to have these "uncomfortable-ass conversations" about race in America, and we need to have them now. (I very strongly suggest that you stop reading this now and go read Gyasi's editorial I Support Bernie Sanders for President and I Also Support the Black Lives Matter Takeover in Seattle.) Ross wrote about the obligation to "protect these sisters" but also to protect "the integrity of the situation". He writes about his own disappointment because, as a Bernie supporter, he'd wanted to hear Bernie speak. He laid the anger of the crowd mostly to this bait and switch. I think that he's by far, the best candidate for Native people and for black folks (and for civil rights, in general). Moreover, he's always been on the right side of history and I think the BLM beefs with him are misplaced. Yet, I also understand that in the grand scheme of things this was simply one small drop of discomfort in an ocean of white supremacist comfort. These small moments are the smallest, tiniest micro-adjustments to white male hegemony, and as dope as he is, that hegemony also includes Bernie Sanders. In my town, I was witness to what happens when a white man disrupts an event where African-American women are speaking and grabs the microphone from their hands. Did the assembled crowd erupt in anger? No. Did anyone speak up to stop him? No. Did a strong protective man leap up onto the stage? No. This was a memorial to Sandra Bland, organized by the local chapter of Showing Up for Racial Justice, which featured young African American women who spoke to this tragic murder of one of their own. One after another, women filtered from the audience to bear witness to their incredible pain over this one woman's death and others like her. One woman sang beautifully. Another woman had the emotionally difficult task of reading out the very long list of women of color of all ages who had lost their lives in this newest genocide by the state. Someone who could be their sister or niece or themselves. As they spoke of the America they lived in where everyone they love is under siege even in their own homes all day long at all hours, tears ran down my face as I listened to their pain. I thought I got it. I didn't. It was a small crowd that could clearly hear the women speaking without the microphone. Nonetheless, an elderly white man took it upon himself to interrupt, not just one but three of the women as they poured out their hearts to the mostly white audience to school them in the proper use of a microphone. It would have been a small matter for me to walk the twenty feet to where he was standing. In hindsight and being my best self, I could have walked over and grasped his wrist and whispered in his ear: This is a memorial. It is not a workshop on using a microphone. Stop this. But I failed my best self. I just stood there with fifty other people and watched this blatant exercise of white patrimony as if it was the most normal thing in the world. Only later, did I realize that it was the most normal thing in America. Racism does not solely exist in the human heart but is made real in the actual public places where we live. It exists on our streets and in our movie theaters, surrounding us like the water which goes unnoticed by the fish. These two young women made us notice the water. It is up to us to recognize and acknowledge the racism in the actual fabric of our society. I am proud of the third woman whom he interrupted because she finally stopped him by saying: It's not about the microphone! However, I am not proud of myself. Neither am I proud of my community. Confederate flag waving red necks were not in attendance. This was a crowd of liberal individuals who had worked for progressive issues all their lives. However, familiarity can breed contempt when we lose the power of true outrage as an over-militarized police force terrorizes and carelessly kills men, women and children guided overwhelmingly by the simple color of their skin and what that means in America today. We thought we got it but we really didn't. Not that particular day in the park. We were unable to overcome the racism present in the very air we breath. Those in the crowd in the park that day surely thought this man's actions were rude, grossly so; however, within the context of our public lives, we did not immediately recognize it for what it was: White patriarchy. As mostly white people are celebrating a political revolution, those who have been marginalized as a matter of course believe that they will--once again--be left behind and forgotten. It is right for them to disrupt to have their voices heard. It is up to us to listen. Honestly, I wasn't crazy about the disrespect for an elder when I saw the young women yelling at Bernie Sanders. But in the big picture, that's light—to disavow a human rights movement because of a moment of disrespect? Therefore, I doubt the sincerity of the so-called white allies who said (and I heard), "Black Lives Matter just lost a supporter!” Oh really? You stopped supporting basic human rights and equal treatment because of two individuals' actions? Damn. Okay—to hell with all black folks because you disagree with two. That's too convenient. If folks truly want to be allies then they're going to have to get cool with uncomfortable-ass conversations. We have to get it this time. We have to get cool with "uncomfortable-ass conversations" which allow us to notice the water first and then act upon that knowledge. Gyasi Ross has the last word: White folks don't ever want to talk about race. Ever. It will ALWAYS be jarring, it will ALWAYS be disruptive and it will ALWAYS be inconvenient. Yet, we have to do it. I'm thankful for these two young ladies for jarring us into a conversation about race even if not at the "right time”—history shows us that if we wait for the "right time” ("right time” = "when white people are ready”), it will never happen. Talking about race is not convenient. Thank you to all Black Lives Matters organizers for forcing this conversation. Thank you, Bernie, for being wise enough to listen.
