Here are the players who protested in Week 6:San Francisco 49ers: Colin Kaepernick, who made his first start of the season, knelt during the national anthem before the 49ers' matchup with the Bills in Buffalo. Kaepernick was again joined by linebacker Eli Harold and safety Eric Reid in taking a knee. Safeties Jaquiski Tartt and Antoine Bethea, running back Mike Davis and cornerbacks Keith Reaser and Rashard Robinson once again raised their right fists as the anthem played. -- Nick WagonerMiami Dolphins: Running back Arian Foster, wide receiver Kenny Stills and safety Michael Thomas knelt for the anthem before the Dolphins' matchup against the Steelers. They've done so for every game this season. Foster said recently that the main purpose of their demonstration is to create a healthy dialogue on systemic racial issues, such as education, the prison system and police brutality toward minorities. In turn, Foster added, productive conversations could help lead to change. "It's just so easy to hate," he said. "If you're proclaiming to be a true American, freedom runs in our bloodlines, right? It's supposed to. If somebody is telling you they don't feel like they're free, why wouldn't you listen to them?" -- James WalkerColin Kaepernick made his first start of the 2016 season against the Bills.

They have done so before every game this season. -- Sheil KapadiaOakland Raiders: Linebackers Bruce Irvin, who raised a fist during the national anthem in previous weeks, instead twirled a pink towel around his head before the Raiders' game against the Chiefs. -- Paul Gutierrez FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmail
