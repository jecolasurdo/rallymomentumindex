Their mistakes could have led to disaster. Coronavirus Friday update: 17 more Minnesota deaths and 356 new cases Access to some major entrances at the Minnesota State Fair was shut down at times Saturday as protesters from Black Lives Matter St. Paul gathered outside the gates. After a 75-minute march from Hamline Park up Snelling Avenue, the protesters first tried to enter Gate 7 on Como Avenue. Police rolled the gates shut just as the first protesters arrived, so the march then headed to the main gates on Snelling Avenue, which they found closed. Outside the main entrance, organizers called for more attention to be paid to social and political injustices faced by minorities. Gov. Mark Dayton and Fair officials were singled out for what protesters saw as a lack of communication and support. "Right now, we've got a governor who cares more about the Fair than he does black bodies in the streets,” said Michael McDowell of Black Lives Matter Minneapolis, a sister organization to the St. Paul group. Fair manager Jerry Hammer said the protest wasn't a major disruption. "There are 17 gates into the Fair,” said Hammer, who thought attendance was not affected by the rally. "This is your basic, typical Saturday. A few of the gates — three along Como — were closed intermittently. I don't know that we lost anybody.” The march, called the BlackFair protest, targeted The Great Minnesota Get-Together on its opening weekend as a way to highlight economic and social disparities. Police estimated the crowd at 350 to 500, and they said about 100 officers were on the scene. "There are going to be thousands of people, low-income people, in St. Paul who are going to smell that food, but they're not going to be able to have any,” BlackFair organizer Rashad Turner said. "A lot of people want to put the (Black Lives Matter) in a box and say, 'You should focus on police brutality,' but it's also about the economic and social justices and how they're interrelated.” Earlier in the week, Turner and others said they believed minorities weren't adequately represented among the Fair's vendors. Fair officials denied that claim. On Saturday morning, before the march began, organizers seemed pleased with the array of ethnic backgrounds present among the marchers. Representatives from the Asian-Pacific Islander community spoke in favor of the Black Lives Matter movement and several speakers called for attention to be paid to transgender women of color and sexual minorities. "There's a lot of white people out here. This ain't a black thing. It's a people thing,” McDowell said. "We understand that in order for us to be liberated, we have to be collaborative.” The protest also sought to capitalize on the statewide attention the Fair attracts. "I don't know how you make people care other than disrupting something,” said Monique Collins-Doty. "So that's what we're going to do.” That approach was met with mixed reviews. Fairgoer Marcus Mitchell, 31, of Minneapolis, and his wife spent Saturday visiting vendors and attractions. They didn't find the demonstration inappropriate. "I'd say it's the right place, right time,” Mitchell said, "as long as there's no violence. It definitely is a good cause.” Bob Schneider of St. Paul was more bemused. "I don't get why they're here,” he said. "They don't have a goal. I don't understand what they're trying to accomplish.” Police closed off Snelling Avenue so that protesters could march on the street. After leaving Hamline Park around 11:45 a.m, the march stopped briefly to block the intersection of West Minnehaha and Snelling avenues. Once it reached the Snelling overpass of Energy Park Drive, marchers lay down in a four-minute "die-in” to call to mind minorities who have been killed by police. Overall, the protest unfolded smoothly. Before the march began, organizers reminded the participants that they sought nonviolent activism and encouraged them not to engage with hecklers. No injuries were reported to St. Paul police, and all streets around the Fairgrounds were open by 3 p.m. The Fair released a statement saying some gates were closed "intermittently” between noon and 2 p.m. The only apparent major disruption to the day's planned activities was the cancellation of a 2 p.m. parade. Hammer, the Fair manager, said five high school marching bands scheduled to participate in the 2 p.m. parade were disappointed that their event was canceled. Some had driven hours to be there, and their performance stage was outside the Fairgrounds. Other than that, the most common complaint he fielded was about the noise from television news helicopters. Someone scratched a profanity into a small sign near a Snelling Avenue entrance, and groundskeepers were inspecting possible damage to flower beds. Hammer said that the rally would not change how the Fair selects vendors, which is based on a colorblind process that does not ask the race of the business owner. He said any preference based on race would be illegal, and that a recent court case involving the Kansas State Fair affirmed the importance of a merit-based application system. Nevertheless, of the six new food vendors this year, three are racial minorities, he said. "The only thing that holds up in court is that everyone is treated exactly the same,” Hammer said.
