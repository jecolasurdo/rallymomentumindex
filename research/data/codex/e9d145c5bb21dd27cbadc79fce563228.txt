They listened to Dallas police chief David Brown urge them to be part of the conversation about race and the tension that exists between law enforcement and minority communities. They'd walked onto the field as part of a moving ceremony, arm-in-arm with Brown, Mayor Mike Rawlings and the families of the victims of the July ambush that left five Dallas officers dead.Weeks later, Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers backup quarterback, initiated a national controversy and discussion by sitting, then kneeling, during the national anthem before games to protest oppression in America, including the excessive use of deadly force by police. Some NFL players and other athletes have joined him, though no Cowboys players.With the Cowboys playing Sunday at the 49ers' Levi's Stadium, Dallas players and coach Jason Garrett were asked for their thoughts about using their platforms to make statements and raise awareness of issues that go beyond football.Thoughtful and guarded answers ensued. Other players told The News they were uncomfortable speaking about the Kaepernick protest because of the sensitive nature of the topic."Everyone is entitled to your own belief," Cowboys cornerback Brandon Carr said. "And our beliefs are shaped by what we've experienced growing up. So we're all going to have a different thought process about what's going on right now."It's clear what the Cowboys brass thinks. Garrett and Cowboys owner Jerry Jones have spoken publicly about their respect for the American flag and the national anthem.Following Dallas' season opener, Jones congratulated the Cowboys on KRLD-FM 105.3 The Fan for not taking part in the protest and called it disappointing to use the visibility of the NFL for anything other than supporting contributors to the flag."The value that we have for the flag, the value that we have for the national anthem, I think it's really, really important," Garrett said. "Our team has chosen to handle it the way we've chosen to handle it. In general, athletes using the platform that they have and the voice that they have in the community can be a positive thing."We did something as a team. ... We came out arm-and-arm with the police chief and the mayor of Dallas. We had the families of the victims in Oxnard with us. ... We thought that was an important demonstration to show our support for the police force and what they do in our communities."Tight end Jason Witten, a 14-year veteran and team captain, was a key figure in conceptualizing the arm-in-arm ceremony."He certainly has his freedom to do that," Witten said of Kaepernick. "The biggest thing I acknowledge is the issue has been brought to the forefront. I think we're all better because of that. ... I certainly stand and put my hand over my heart and honor the flag and show tribute to that because it's something that I'm extremely proud of."Witten has pointed to a letter that he carries in his backpack. It's written by University of Texas System Chancellor Bill McRaven. Garrett has acknowledged reading it.A retired Navy Admiral who was the architect of the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, McRaven urged his athletes to stand for the anthem, according to The Texas Tribune."While no one should be compelled to stand, they should recognize that by sitting in protest to the flag they are disrespecting everyone who sacrificed to make this country what it is today -- as imperfect as it might be," he wrote in August.McRaven also lauded the value of freedom of speech and noted, "Those that believe the flag represents oppression should remember all the Americans who fought to eliminate bigotry, racism, sexism, imperialism, communism and terrorism."Witten pointed to McRaven's overall message and said: "What we've done as a country over the years, it's not perfect by any means, but continue to honor that and working through it, that's something that I'm proud of."Carr, a social conscience of sorts for the Cowboys, didn't hesitate to share his thoughts on Kaepernick."I think he's a very brave and courageous person," Carr said. "When he first made a statement, he was all by himself. And to stand by yourself and to be firm in your stance and your beliefs and to not even flinch off of all the backlash that came with it ... I know I tip my hat off to him to start this movement."Carr said that while change is uncomfortable, it's important to be having discussions that can lead to solutions. He said that he wouldn't choose to protest. Instead, he's active in his community outreach programs and tries to make the differences that he can there, including through education."The true I guess test will be once the season is over and we walk away from the game," Carr said. "Are we still going to be talking about hopefully getting a handle on what's going on in different communities with the police and the interaction with the citizens and get that to a mutual understanding or some kind of peace?"Carr, in his ninth year in the NFL, felt comfortable expanding on the topic, but that's not the case for all players."Some guys aren't comfortable just because of the box we've been put in as athletes, we can only talk about certain things," he said. "But we have a life outside of these walls. We have children. We have families. We grew up in these communities as well, so we experienced it."Cornerback Morris Claiborne said he feels a responsibility to speak out when it's an issue that needs it, but that athletes must also be aware of the criticism that can come with it.Claiborne said Chief Brown's message at training camp stuck with him."It meant a lot," he said. "I feel like all the things that go on in this world today, no one deserves to lose their life, I don't care who it is, a police officer, a regular human being. No one deserves to lose their life."Rookie defensive end Charles Tapper was drawn into a discussion about race while in college at Oklahoma. A video emerged of OU fraternity members signing a racist chant. The football team walked arm-in-arm in a silent protest and then tried to take action."I respect the guys doing it and the guys not doing it," Tapper said of those speaking out. "People are trying to make a change. It's not one race, it's a bunch of different races. It's good to see we can make some changes. I saw a soccer woman, a baseball player -- Adam Jones ... People are taking strides to make this world better, I'm happy to see that."But Tapper also sees why Kaepernick's protest is a sensitive topic."It's hard because the national anthem, it's so big," he said. "It's your country."While Kaepernick's protest has drawn all kinds of reactions, he has continued to be supported by 49ers coach Chip Kelly, even when the focus on the protest has seemed at times to dwarf the attention placed on football.Kelly said it hasn't been a coaching challenge."It's a choice of every citizen in the United States to express their feelings," he said. "I don't think we're doing anything special to handle that. I think Colin has an opinion on subjects that are very valid. He's expressing those opinions. That's what being a member of this country is all about, that we're allowed to do that."Locally, with the Mavericks preparing to start their NBA season, owner Mark Cuban and coach Rick Carlisle made it clear this week that they will support whatever their players decide to do -- if anything -- regarding making a protest or statement.On Sunday, Kaepernick will likely again kneel during "The Star-Spangled Banner" and the 49ers-Cowboys will kick off and football, as usual, will be the focus.But the discussion goes on."I think the team did a good job of handling that in training camp and trying to get our message out there that it's a bigger deal than sometimes it's seen, but also that everybody needs to work together to solve the issues," said Cowboys center Travis Frederick, also a team captain. "It's not one guy doing one thing, or one side doing one thing. There needs to be open communication between both sides of the stories."Email IconKate HairopouloskHairopoulos@dallasnews.com @kHairopoulos Dallas Protest UpdatesCoronavirus UpdatesGraduation announcementsYour city's newsFind takeout & deliveryLocal business gift cardsInspired: Good newsTimeless in TexasCurious TexasNewspaper ArchivesPuzzles and gamesAl Día - Noticias en Español ObituariesToday's ePaperTop Sports StoriesWas that so hard?
