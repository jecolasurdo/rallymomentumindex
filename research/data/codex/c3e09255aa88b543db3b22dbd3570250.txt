Nelson Travis DormanKnoxvilleAfter a Knoxville police officer shot and killed a 33-year-old man on Monday night, activists are mobilizing to demand answers to their questions about his death.About 75 protesters showed up to Tuesday's City Council meeting the day after the shooting of Channara Tom "Philly" Pheap at a northwest Knoxville apartment complex. Activists who spoke during the public forum portion of the meeting criticized officials for funding a new police headquarters instead of equipping officers with body cameras, demanded an independent investigation into the shooting and called for the ouster of Knoxville Police Department Chief Eve Thomas.Activist Denzel Grant brought Pheap's young daughter and her mother to the podium. As Grant spoke, the girl smiled at audience members from her mother's arms."This beautiful young girl, she just lost her father to murder," Grant said. Few details have been released about the shooting. The protest came a short time after Knoxville Mayor Madeline Rogero released a statement urging "everyone to remain calm and withhold judgement until the investigation is completed and we are aware of all the facts."Additionally, Rogero's statement said, in part: "I know we are all awaiting the completion of these investigations. But please understand that gathering the facts and getting to the truth takes time. I urge everyone to be patient."She expressed her "heartfelt sympathies" to Pheap's family and friends.Moments before the shooting, Pheap was involved in a hit-and-run crash on Merchant Drive, according to a KPD statement. The officer was responding to the crash when he became involved in a "physical altercation" with Pheap and ultimately shot him at Clear Springs Apartments, KPD said.The officer was injured, taken to a hospital, treated and released, according to KPD.In addition to his biological daughter, Pheap "had two other kids that he raised as well, that also called him father," said Grant, who after the shooting broadcast video from the scene on Facebook. "And they watched on the balcony as their father lay in the cold rain for three hours."Knox County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Kimberly Glenn declined Tuesday to release more details surrounding the shooting, including whether Pheap was armed, citing the ongoing investigation. The Knox County Sheriff's Office is investigating the shooting, which is part of an agreement between the departments so officers don't investigate their own.That's not enough to ensure a fair investigation, activists said."We all know about the sheriffs," candidate David Hayes said at the meeting, hours before he would know the results of his primary election bid for City Council. "Having the sheriffs police the police? Come on." Ahead of the meeting, Hayes' campaign released a statement calling on Rogero and the City Council to release all dashboard camera footage, to appoint an independent investigator and to expand the powers and resources of the city's volunteer citizen Police Advisory and Review Committee, or PARC.Speakers at the meeting, including activist Constance Every, pointed out that Pheap's death marks the fourth fatal shooting by police in Knox County within a year.Pheap is of Cambodian descent. But Every said the history of mistrust between the black community and the police has deep roots: from the police's role in retrieving — and abusing — runaway slaves, to adversarial actions during the Civil Rights Movement, to the current day when, Every said, areas of town that are heavily minority and low-income are maligned and "overpoliced" by officers. That sense of distrust extends to other minorities, she said — including lower-income residents.PARC was formed to address issues between law enforcement and the community after after three men of color were killed in controversial struggles with Knoxville police in 1997 and 1998. But the committee hasn't done much to assuage concerns, Every said.Hayes said PARC, long criticized as a "rubber stamp" function, currently has no power to effect change. The committee has subpoena power but has never used it.Unlike Nashville's counterpart organization, Hayes said, PARC has no real budget and no "robust" staff. And the committee lacks the power to discipline police officers, affect the budget of law enforcement "when and if necessary," and change or update police policies and procedures. PARC's executive director can only make recommendations; all changes must be approved by the city mayor and the chief of police.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Public Notices Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My AccountSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJob Network Cars Homes Classifieds 10Best Reviewed Reach Local© 2020 www.knoxnews.com.
