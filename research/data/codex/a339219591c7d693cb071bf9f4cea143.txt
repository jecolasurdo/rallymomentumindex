"How do you expect my son to respect law enforcement when you hit him with a pepper ball? Y'all hit my 6-year-old child with your pepper ball." Reverend Michael Waters, an activist who has repeatedly called for the removal of the city's Confederate monuments, said Jean's death is part of a pattern in Dallas. "On April 25, city council had the opportunity to make a statement to the world that black lives matter. Instead council decided to uphold the legacy of white supremacy in Dallas...by not bringing down monuments to white supremacy," he said. "I want you to see historical connection. Only a few blocks from where a monument to white supremacy stands, a young black man was executed in his own home. When you put that together, the city decided black lives don't matter."
