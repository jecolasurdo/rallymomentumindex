An hour into the evening protest, about 10 demonstrators were arrested and charged with obstructing a roadway after they chained their bodies together and blocked the entrance to the Chicago Police Department's Homan Square facility.

I'm here to imagine a world where that money would be spent on education, mental health, to open school, clinics, create jobs." The demonstration coincided with similar protests Wednesday in New York and Washington, D.C. Advertisement Organized by a group called the Let Us Breathe Collective, the march started at Douglas Park in front of the home of Chicago police Officer Dante Servin. Protesters then marched down residential blocks and joined activists who were chained together in the road in front of the Homan Square police facility at South Homan Avenue and West Fillmore Street. After singing songs, chanting and reciting poems, the crowd was asked to leave by police. When the group that was chained together refused to move, police took them into custody. Police had to gather tools and use hand saws to remove the protesters. It took police about an hour to make the arrests. Another march pushing for an end to traditional policing is planned Thursday in Chicago and will take the cause directly to Chicago police headquarters. Breaking News Hundreds protest police brutality, gnarling traffic on downtown streets High school students urge young people to confront present-day racism, injustice By Patrick M. O'Connell and Marwa Eltaguori Jul 12, 2016 | 8:24 AM "We want a full divestment from policing and a full investment in black communities," said Charlene Carruthers, national director at Black Youth Project 100. "We want a world where we don't deal with conflict with police and prisons. It's a process. It's not just about tearing things down but building up alternatives, institutions and practices that deal with conflict and harm without punishment." The protests come as the nation is still reeling from the shooting deaths of five police officers in Dallas and three in Baton Rouge, La., and also dealing with the police shootings of Alton B. Sterling in Baton Rouge and Philando Castile in Minnesota. The marches continue a longstanding push against police violence directed at African-Americans.

"Our movement has never called for the execution of police officers," Carruthers said. "What we have done is called out the amount of power (police) have in our lives. At this moment, black families are also grieving and our actions continue because black people continue to be killed, live in poverty and live in communities that are hyper-surveilled and policed." Protesters set up a gathering site in a vacant lot near Homan Square and called it Freedom Square. It was another way to engage the community and promote the message to end policing, said Kristiana Rae Colon, co-founder of the Let Us Breathe Collective.

"Almost 40 percent of Chicago's budget goes to CPD right now, while we claim we're too broke to fund our schools or pay for mental health services. There is a myth that Chicago is broke. Chicago is investing in what it deems necessary, which is different from what the people deem as necessary. "Violence in black lives comes in the form of police abuse sometimes," she said. "But state violence is also closing schools, closing mental health facilities, funding housing inequities." lbowean@tribpub.com Twitter @lollybowean Recommended on Chicago Tribune Advertisement Latest Breaking News Breaking News Live updates: Large crowds expected downtown and elsewhere in Chicago area for marches and Juneteenth events 9m Coronavirus Coronavirus in Illinois updates: Chicago will offer $200 to each taxicab to help pay for personal protective equipment 10m Coronavirus Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot delivers commencement speech at Northwestern, says democracy will fail 'if we do not see the humanity in each other' 21m Advertisement Most Read • Breaking News Live updates: Large crowds expected downtown and elsewhere in Chicago area for marches and Juneteenth events 9m Eager to head back to the lakefront?
