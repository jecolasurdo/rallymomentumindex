His death has led to massive protests across Minneapolis and the country, at times turning violent, with clashes between law enforcement and protesters. Friday's protest was largely peaceful, but marked by verbal confrontations between some protesters and police. At least initially, there were few arrests. In one case early on it took at least two officers to subdue a demonstrator who they held to the pavement and cuffed.Anger over the Minneapolis killing was evident as some protesters made their way out of Foley Square, to a local police precinct, and eventually down Canal Street shouting "Hands up! Don't shoot!” and "I am a revolutionary!”Some held up signs of past police brutality victims: Eric Garner, Sandra Bland, Philando Castile and Jamar Clark. At one point someone spray painted "we have nothing to lose but our chains" on the fountain at Foley Square.Later in the Manhattan protest, demonstrators blocked traffic at the intersection of Centre and Broome streets. The group moved on to Houston and Lafayette, some of them kneeling while blocking traffic in both directions.Story continues after photo galleryDemonstrator Ashly Vidal of Brooklyn said she was there "for justice, for the people."She said she wasn't surprised by Floyd's killing."We see it all the time," she said. "People are really angry now."A cellphone video captured Floyd pleading with officer Derek Chauvin to remove his knee from Floyd's neck while police were investigating the use of a counterfeit bill at a corner store. Chauvin and the three others officers involved were fired Tuesday.By Friday afternoon, Chauvin was arrested. He was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. An investigation into the other officers was ongoing.During Friday's protest in Manhattan, a robotic announcement from the police kept repeating, warning demonstrators to get out of the street or face arrest."I don't want my son to be scared of you,” one demonstrator said to a line of police officers."Let's us sit on your neck... any volunteers?” an organizer with a megaphone said to police across the street from the demonstration.Police on bicycles rode along the edge of the street as some of the protesters walked along the sidewalk away from Foley Square, and cars dove by tooting their horns in support. One protester held a sign that said, "I'm tired. #BLM,” a reference to the Black Lives Matter movement."We're having a peaceful protest and these cowards are trying to run us over with bikes in broad daylight," said one of the demonstrators, a man in his 20's.PROTESTS: Across the country, protests are erupting over the death of George FloydPOLICE: Officers at center of George Floyd death had a history of complaintsGEORGE FLOYD: Vigil held in White Plains on FridayThe protest, located in lower Manhattan near the Brooklyn Bridge, was the second one in as many days in New York City, with organizers encouraging protesters to wear black and face masks.A protest Thursday night that started at Union Square resulted in the arrest or summonses of more than 70 protesters, mostly for violating social distancing rules, according to the New York Police Department.
