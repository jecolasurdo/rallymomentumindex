A white Minneapolis police officer was charged Wednesday with third-degree murder for his alleged role in the 46-year-old black man's death while in police custody. The St. Louis region still hasn't healed from the death of Michael Brown Jr., who was fatally shot by a white police officer Aug. 9, 2014, in Ferguson, Missouri, a North St. Louis County suburb, where similar protests took place following Brown's death during an altercation with police. The Black Lives Matter movement began as an online campaign in summer 2013, after George Zimmerman's acquittal for the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, in Florida. The movement began with the hashtag #BlackLivesMatter and gained momentum when peaceful protest rallies and violent riots occurred in Ferguson six years ago. Some of the protesters who were in Edwardsville are part of the movement. Sunday's rally was organized as a Facebook event by Jaymisen Leigh-Ann Bushong, who according to her Facebook profile works in Jerseyville, and Haylee Gaines, who according to her social media profile, is from Alton, but lives in St. Louis. They stated in Facebook posts that they did not expect much of a showing, but roughly 300 people showed up to protest police brutality and excessive use of force, particularly with black people. Protesters also said they wanted to shed light on equality injustice. Some of the activists told personal stories regarding injustices that they said occurred in Edwardsville. A graduate of Edwardsville High School who would not give her full name said her family has faced inequality and injustice. She said she was called racial slurs by EHS classmates and was proud of the atmosphere Sunday. "I cried — just to see all the love and courage is heartwarming,” the woman said. "I've never seen anything like this in my life.” More Information Police express support for rights of those gathered at courthouse EDWARDSVILLE — The Edwardsville Police Department issued a prepared statement Sunday night following a protest rally. "The men and women of the Edwardsville Police Department were shocked and saddened by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. It was difficult to watch the video of Mr. Floyd begging for help while a police officer was kneeling on his neck. This action clearly did not represent proper restraint tactics in policing. "Edwardsville Police officers take pride in providing professional and courteous service for our community, while respecting the dignity of all people and the sanctity of human life. As individuals, and as a department, we support and defend the rights of all people. "To that extent, we support the rights of those who have gathered at the Madison County Courthouse (Sunday) in order to have their collective voices heard. We share in their grief, frustration and anger over the death of Mr. Floyd. Our officers have worked hard to develop a strong collaborative relationship with the members of our community. We have trained often in the appropriate use of force, safely taking individuals into custody and de-escalation techniques. "The men and women of our police department will continue to provide respectful, compassionate and professional service to the citizens and visitors of Edwardsville. We will always be there when our community needs us. Thank you for allowing us the opportunity to serve." Most attendees agreed that the atmosphere was positive and peaceful. While most of the activists brought their voices and many brought signs, a few brought drums and other instruments. Bob Gill, of Alton, said he brought his drum to help get the crowd more lively. He said previous protests have "fallen on deaf ears” and that he hopes that will soon change. "It's amazing to hear all the emotions in voices,” said another woman, who would not give her full name but said she lived in Fairview Heights. "Honestly there are more Caucasians than black people out here, and I honestly didn't know that was possible.” She held a sign that read "Stop killing us!!!” while standing next to her was her son, Jayden, 11, holding a sign that read "Am I next??” She thought twice before she decided to bring her son to the rally. "I was a little skeptical at first, but as I thought about bringing him, the more I realized it's everywhere,” she said. "He sees it on TikTok, YouTube and Snapchat, and he needs to know about it.” Some participants who said they have not had personal experiences with inequality or injustice, said they still feel the need to protest and help the cause. A Glen Carbon resident said her son and daughter moved to Minneapolis and live close to where some of the riots are occurring. She said she does not condone any use of violence and she said she also does not condone what happened to Floyd and the other black men and women who have been killed as a result of interaction with police. "Inequality has gone on for a long time, and we need to fix our laws and legislation,” she said.
