LOUIS • Monica Foxwell admitted to a slight case of nerves on Sunday afternoon as she climbed the stone steps of Lafayette Park United Methodist Church for an event billed as "Faith In Action Mobilizing Training.”Her unease was understandable, considering that the event's flowery designation veiled a disagreeable prospect."I guess I'm here to learn how to get arrested,” said Foxwell, 48, of downtown St. Louis.The program was part of the weekend's FergusonOctober rallies and protests. It included lessons and demonstrations in civil disobedience in advance of what event planners had called Monday's "series of actions” in Ferguson and St. Louis. Organizers would not divulge their plans for Monday. They asked reporters to leave the church during part of the training session.However, they conducted some activities in the open, including a role-playing game on the sidewalk in front of the church on Lafayette Avenue in which participants acting as protesters rushed a police station. It attracted about 120 people, most of whom, judging by a show of hands, had traveled from outside the St. Louis area.They included Nick Stocks, 31, of Pittsburgh, who arrived late last week. Stocks participated in Saturday's march downtown to protest the death of Michael Brown. Stocks also attended events in Ferguson on Saturday. It was part of a long day for him that included participating with about 150 other protesters in a demonstration at the QuikTrip near the Grove business and entertainment district early Sunday.About 50 of the protesters briefly conducted a sit-in, blocking the entrance to the store.Police said they arrested 17 people for unlawful assembly there.Stocks bristled at the "outside agitator” tag he said some police have applied to out-of-towners such as him."Ferguson is everywhere,” he said. "Pittsburgh has the same issues. New York City has the same issues. It's a common narrative nationwide.” The trainers included veterans of civil disobedience and direct action protests across the country.Lisa Fithian, 53, of Austin, Texas, has organized scores of social, economic and environmental demonstrations.She urged participants to gird themselves for the potentially harsh realities of civil disobedience."This is not a game. This is not a joke,” Fithian said. "When you take direct action, you could be hurt or arrested.”Fithian led participants in various exercises on the church parking lot that included keeping track of each other in confrontations with police, and the differences — as well as the legal consequences — between sit-down demonstrations and fleeing from officers. Foxwell said she has been protesting in Ferguson since Aug. 11, two days after a police officer shot and killed Brown."I came here out of concern for my own son,” she said. "He's a 20-year-old college student, and I want him to be able to live in a world that is less violent and threatening for him.” She said that the prospect of getting arrested frightened her."I've never been arrested,” she said. "But somebody's got to do it.” "When you move (during civil disobedience) pay attn to the spaces between your bodies." #ferguson https://t.co/gYhc62XntQ— Paul Hampel (@phampel) October 12, 2014 0 comments Tags Fergusonoctober St. Louis Civil Disobedience Lafayette Park United Methodist Church Monica Foxwell Nick Stocks Lisa Fithian Be the first to know Get local news delivered to your inbox!
