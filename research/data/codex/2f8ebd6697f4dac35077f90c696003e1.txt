The group held signs and chanted "No justice, no peace,” on the steps of Gary City Hall until four police officers arrived and ordered them off the steps. Some of the protesters, including Jesse Cunningham, the father of Rashad, yelled back at police who stayed for a few minutes before heading back inside the building.

His son was shot and killed by a police officer while he was sitting in a car with two people in the 300 block of Kentucky Street in front of Cunningham's residence. Gary police said they were called to the scene by a "shots fired” call.

She identified the name of the police officer who killed her son, but authorities have not released the officer's name. On Monday, Kim McGee, of Black Lives Matter-Northwest Indiana, said the group has been seeking an independent citizen review of police shooting incidents. "Basically, the mayor agreed and put together a committee. But she came up with a board that wasn't going to be independent,” McGee said of Gary Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson. "It's amazing how quick they are to shoot black individuals,” said McGee. "Cameras aren't the only way to create accountability. Gary was part of a DOJ (U.S. Department of Justice) program,” she said was aimed at deescalating violence. Some of the protesters spoke about the deadly encounters their own loved ones had with police. "If there's no immediate threat, then why are people dead,” asked Tasheena Brooks, the mother of 15-year-old Kemonte Cobbs who was killed by a Gary police officer in 2017 at 19th Avenue and Hanley Street after a pursuit.
