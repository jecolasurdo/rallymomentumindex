The group held signs and chanted "No justice, no peace,” on the steps of Gary City Hall until four police officers arrived and ordered them off the steps. Some of the protesters, including Jesse Cunningham, the father of Rashad, yelled back at police who stayed for a few minutes before heading back inside the building.

His son was shot and killed by a police officer while he was sitting in a car with two people in the 300 block of Kentucky Street in front of Cunningham's residence. Gary police said they were called to the scene by a "shots fired” call. Last week, Gary City Council President Ron Brewer called for the release of the 911 dispatch tape, but on Monday he said he hasn't received anything from police.

She identified the name of the police officer who killed her son, but authorities have not released the officer's name. On Monday, Kim McGee, of Black Lives Matter-Northwest Indiana, said the group has been seeking an independent citizen review of police shooting incidents. "Basically, the mayor agreed and put together a committee. But she came up with a board that wasn't going to be independent,” McGee said of Gary Mayor Karen Freeman-Wilson. "It's amazing how quick they are to shoot black individuals,” said McGee. "Cameras aren't the only way to create accountability. Gary was part of a DOJ (U.S. Department of Justice) program,” she said was aimed at deescalating violence. Some of the protesters spoke about the deadly encounters their own loved ones had with police. "If there's no immediate threat, then why are people dead,” asked Tasheena Brooks, the mother of 15-year-old Kemonte Cobbs who was killed by a Gary police officer in 2017 at 19th Avenue and Hanley Street after a pursuit.

"He was shot in the top of his head, execution style,” Brooks said. "This will keep happening until we stand up as a people and you have to fight back.” Lorenzo Stone-Bey, of Gary, said his stepson, William Spates, was shot and killed by Portage police after a traffic stop. "Police used a (stun gun) on him and he had no weapon,” he said. Authorities ruled the shooting was justified and the officer acted in self-defense. Last year, Spates' family filed a federal lawsuit against the police officer in connection with the shooting. Reba Sykes, of Gary, said police shot her son, Thomas Watkins III, 38, last year in Gary. Police were called to the 600 block of New Jersey Street in response to a call about a "suspicious vehicle.” Latest Post-Tribune Gary marks Juneteenth with celebration as day rockets into American conversation 43m Richard Ligon resigns as Gary police chief after 6 months: 'I just thought it was time for me to step out of the way' 1h Column: When an elderly man living alone in squalor says he doesn't need help, what can we do? 1h Guest column: The Pandemic, the Police and Politics 1h Hutton: Newly hired Portage football coach Terry Chestovich, a self-described 'grinder,' says he has no illusions about the task ahead 2h Police contended Watkins had a gun and the police officer fired in self-defense.
