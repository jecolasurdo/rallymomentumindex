Protesters say they saw the apology that Starbucks made but feel it was made in hopes that the incident would be forgotten after. They came out here to show that is not going to happen until they get more than words. "No longer, no further,” the protesters chanted outside of the Spruce Street Starbucks. Nearly 100 people gathered outside of the Rittenhouse Square Starbucks, where a manager called the police on two African American men and had them arrested on April 12th. The men were sitting in the Starbucks for just a few minutes waiting for a friend to discuss real estate business. Starbucks CEO Wants To Personally Apologize To Men Arrested In Philly Store The incident was captured on camera and inspired public outrage. @Starbucks The police were called because these men hadn't ordered anything. They were waiting for a friend to show up, who did as they were taken out in handcuffs for doing nothing. All the other white ppl are wondering why it's never happened to us when we do the same thing. pic.twitter.com/0U4Pzs55Ci — Melissa DePino (@missydepino) April 12, 2018 "I've sat in this Starbucks, this Starbucks right here, without purchasing anything, you know working on something with my friends,” said Alyssa Posoff. "I've never had a problem.” Despite Starbucks issuing a public apology Saturday, things are not dying down. Protestors are not only calling for a continued boycott of the business, but they are also demanding for the manager of the store to be fired. In order to make that message clear, the crowd went into the Starbucks to speak with a corporate representative. The crowd was clearly unhappy with the representative who was seemingly defending the store manager now. Several of the protesters said they were encouraged by the number of diverse faces that attended Sunday's protest to stand up for the two African American men who were arrested. Attorney Lauren Wimmer, who is representing the men, said, "These guys were doing what people do every single day. They were having a meeting and they were undoubtedly singled out because of their race.” 'Internal Investigation' Underway Following Arrest At Philly Starbucks Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson posted a statement Saturday night to address the situation. He called it "disheartening” and said that it led to a "reprehensible” outcome. Philadelphia-native actor and entertainer, Kevin Hart has been very vocal about his dissatisfaction with the handling of the mens' arrest. He shared several tweets pertaining to Starbucks and the measures that have been taken so far. @Starbucks in Philadelphia I have watched the video and do not see these to young men doing anything wrong....Unless there is footage that shows otherwise you need to do what's right and handle the manager that was on duty accordingly. — Kevin Hart (@KevinHart4real) April 15, 2018 Let's make one thing very clear....This is not a boycott @Starbucks situation....This is horrible management. The manager on duty was wrong. It's that simple...That's who needs to take responsibility for this wrong doing. — Kevin Hart (@KevinHart4real) April 15, 2018 Hart urges Starbucks to "do what's right”. His final tweet in the thread addressing the matter expresses that Philadelphia is "shining bright like a diamond right now”. Message to the @Starbucks in Philadelphia....Our city is shining bright like a diamond right now. Please make this situation right. I repeat please make this situation right!!!!!!! Once again MAKE THIS RIGHT — Kevin Hart (@KevinHart4real) April 15, 2018 Others, such as former professional tennis player Billie Jean King, have made their feelings known as well. The arrest of 2 African-American men in a Philadelphia @Starbucks is deeply troubling. This event is not representative of how Starbucks operates. Kevin Johnson's apology & actions are a good 1st step. An investigation will follow, and we should give them the time to do it. — Billie Jean King (@BillieJeanKing) April 15, 2018 In his official statement, CEO Kevin Johnson said, "You can and should expect more from us. We will learn from this and be better.” The CEO has also stated that he would like to meet face-to-face with the men involved and apologize. Philadelphia councilman Kenyatta Johnson is holding a press conference at 4 p.m Monday, at the Spruce Street Starbucks. Johnson says he plans on joining community leaders to denounce racial profiling in places of public accommodation.
