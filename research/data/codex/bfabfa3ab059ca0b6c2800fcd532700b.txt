(WTNH) ‚Äî New Haven Police Chief Otoniel Reyes sat with protesters Wednesday afternoon, fielding questions, engaging with young people and promising to not just listen, but continue to push for change. A protest march started with a few dozen protesters on the New Haven Green around 1 p.m. Wednesday. Organizers called it a March for Justice and Peace. The crowd grew as they marched through downtown. At Police Headquarters, ralliers were met by top police brass who took a knee in solidarity with the young people who came to air their grievances and their hope.

It hurts so bad,‚Äù organizer Taylor Hill told the officers. "I want to listen and I want you at the table with me when the cameras are gone,‚Äù said Chief Reyes. He sat with about 60 or so protesters, discussing shared outrage over the death of George Floyd, problems with policing, and his own experiences with racism even while in uniform. Reyes fielded angry questions about his department's use of force over the weekend when officers used pepper spray to push back protesters from entering the police department. "Protesters were pepper sprayed right here,‚Äù said one woman.

An officer got hit with a bottle [and] has a black eye..before the pepper spray,‚Äù answered Reyes. He says he plans to release video footage that shows protesters hurling abuse at officers before the use of force. Despite that the conversation Wednesday was constructive. Organizers even called it 'awesome.' They felt heard, and hopeful. Both sides agreed to continue the dialogue. "I've been angry, I've been sad, and there's such an outlet to make a difference...I knew we needed to make a change,‚Äù said Hill. "I know police ultimately want to help sometimes there's this gray area and I want to help be one of the people to help,‚Äù said Maya Donald.
