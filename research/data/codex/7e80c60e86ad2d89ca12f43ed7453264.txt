The rally was held on Black Friday because organizers wanted to draw attention to the economy. Speakers at the rally asked to increase the minimum wage to $15 per hour. But speakers also talked economics, specifically, ending capitalism. Brandi Miller spoke at the rally, and said the Black Lives Matter movement is intertwined with what she calls 'economic revolution'. Miller said she knows that position will scare off some supporters. Brandi Miller joined the hundreds of people for the Black Lives Matter movement rally on Black Friday. Jason Bernert/OPB "That's why things like reparations never go through – that's why affirmative action never goes through. It's because even people who talk the talk never walk the walk in that regard, which ends up being a really big problem,” said Miller. That message was taken to the streets after the rally, as Black Lives Matter supporters marched downtown before returning to a park across from the Lloyd Center and entering the mall.
