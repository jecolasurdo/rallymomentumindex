Here are the players who protested in Week 3:Atlanta Falcons and New Orleans Saints: The two teams came together for a powerful display of unity Monday night by joining hands in a circle around the field following the national anthem. A source told ESPN's Britt McHenry that Saints coach Sean Payton reached out to Falcons coach Dan Quinn with the idea earlier in the week -- and player leaders from both teams loved it. The gesture was inspired by the latest police shootings in Charlotte and Tulsa this past week. The source suggested that a handful of players had been feeling outside pressure to join the cause, but that they didn't want to do it at the expense of the teams. -- Mike TriplettPhiladelphia Eagles: Safety Malcolm Jenkins and cornerback Ron Brooks each raised an arm above their heads during the national anthem prior to Sunday's home game against the Steelers. Jenkins and Brooks made the same gesture prior to Monday's game against the Bears. On that night, they were joined by teammates Marcus Smith and Steven Means in demonstration, but neither of those players showed any visible form of protest Sunday. -- Tim McManusSan Francisco 49ers: For the fourth week in a row, quarterback Colin Kaepernick and safety Eric Reid knelt during the national anthem. Linebacker Eli Harold, who previously had been raising a right fist, joined Kaepernick and Reid in taking a knee. Safety Antoine Bethea, safety Jaquiski Tartt and cornerback Rashard Robinson held up their right fists again and were joined by cornerback Keith Reaser and running back Mike Davis on Sunday in Seattle. -- Nick WagonerIndianapolis Colts: Cornerback Antonio Cromartie became the first Colts player to take a knee during the national anthem prior to Sunday's game against the Chargers. While the rest of his teammates stood along the sideline, Cromartie was on a knee in the row behind them. -- Mike WellsBroncos linebacker Brandon Marshall has been one of the NFL's most vocal players during the last month.

Fluker and King Dunlap in raising right fists in silent protest during the national anthem prior to Sunday's game in Indianapolis. -- Eric D. WilliamsSeattle Seahawks: For the third straight game, the Seahawks linked arms together and stood as a demonstration of unity during the national anthem. -- Sheil KapadiaLos Angeles Rams: Defensive end Robert Quinn raised his right fist in the air during the national anthem in Tampa Bay. This is the third week in a row in which he has done it. -- Alden GonzalezJacksonville Jaguars: Four Jaguars players -- defensive end Dante Fowler Jr., defensive end Jared Odrick, linebacker Telvin Smith and linebacker Hayes Pullard -- raised their right hands during the national anthem before the game against Baltimore at EverBank Field. It was the first time any Jaguars player had done any kind of action during the national anthem. -- Mike DiRoccoDenver Broncos: Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall kneeled for the national anthem in Cincinnati on Sunday. It is the third consecutive game Marshall has taken a knee during the anthem. He was a teammate of Kaepernick's at the University of Nevada. Marshall also met with Denver Chief of Police Robert C. White earlier this month. Marshall has agreed to donate $300 for every tackle he makes this season to charitable programs in Denver. -- Jeff LegwoldMiami Dolphins: Wide receiver Kenny Stills, safety Michael Thomas and running back Arian Foster, who is inactive, kneeled for the anthem. Stills and Thomas shook hands and hugged immediately after standing. Foster said recently the main purpose of their demonstration is to create a healthy dialogue on systemic racial issues such as education, the prison system and police brutality toward minorities. In turn, Foster added, productive conversations could help lead to change. "It's just so easy to hate," he said. "If you're proclaiming to be a true American, freedom runs in our bloodlines, right? It's supposed to. If somebody is telling you they don't feel like they're free, why wouldn't you listen to them?" -- Pat McManamonTennessee Titans: Cornerback Jason McCourty, defensive tackle Jurrell Casey, linebacker Wesley Woodyard and defensive end DaQuan Jones raised a fist after the national anthem prior to the Titans' home game against the Raiders. McCourty and Casey have raised their fists in every regular-season game, but this is the first time Woodyard and Jones have done so. Last week, Casey explained what the gesture meant to him: "A small symbol showing we are looking for equal opportunity in this world, and we just need justice for all the things that's going on around here." -- Paul KuharskyCarolina Panthers: Backup safety Marcus Ball stood with his right hand raised and index finger extended during the national anthem before the Panthers' matchup against the visiting Vikings. -- David NewtonWashington Redskins: Four Redskins players protested during the national anthem by raising their right fists before Sunday's game at the Giants. It's the first time any Redskins players have joined in the growing protests during the anthem. The players who raised their right fist were receiver DeSean Jackson, corner Greg Toler, receiver Rashad Ross and tight end Niles Paul. Earlier in the week, Jackson had posted a message on his Instagram account that read in part, "Us as black people are a threat, so just take our lives smh. The system been set up for us not to live and make it thru all this [nonsense]. Another RIP to [Crutcher] but they say have faith & trust?? In what them to keep killing our [loved ones]?” -- John KeimOakland Raiders: Linebackers Bruce Irvin and Malcolm Smith raised their right fists during the national anthem at Tennessee. Both players spent time with the Seahawks, who organized a show of unity before the first game of the regular season when they locked arms during "The Star-Spangled Banner." During the preseason, Raiders coach Jack Del Rio said his organization respected Kaepernick's right to protest but would remain standing for the anthem. "For us, I think it's more about recognizing you're part of an organization and you're representing our organization and our organization believes you should pay respect to the flag,” Del Rio said at the time. "So save those individual decisions to express yourself for an individual forum. That's how we feel, in talking with [Raiders owner] Mark Davis." -- Paul GutierrezHouston Texans: Texans left tackle Duane Brown raised his fist during the national anthem Thursday night at Gillette Stadium before the Texans faced the Patriots. Coach Bill O'Brien said he supports Brown, who was inactive for the game because of injury. "I understand that there is a lot going on in this country right now and that we all have strong opinions about it," he said. "Duane Brown expressed himself during the anthem, which is his right. It is his right of free speech. It's his right to do what he did during the anthem last night. I support his individual right to do that." -- Sarah Barshop FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmail
