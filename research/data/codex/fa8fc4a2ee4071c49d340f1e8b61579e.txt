Cummings of Maryland – who has urged congressional hearings on Brown and Garner's deaths – said in a statement that "Democrats and Republicans across the country are incredibly frustrated by what happened in Ferguson, Staten Island and elsewhere.” The top Democrat on the House and Government Reform Committee added, "This protest reflects the mistrust they have in the integrity of the criminal justice system.” RELATED: Congressman Hakeem Jeffries joins in 'Hands up, don't shoot' A number of groups reportedly organized the event, including the Congressional Black Associates, Senate Black Legislative Staff Caucus, and the African American Women on the Hill Network. They were joined by those working for the Congressional Asian Pacific American Staff Association and the Hispanic Staff Association.
