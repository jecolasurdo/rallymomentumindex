"These are our brothers and sisters. Today and every day, we honor their lives.” Another restaurant: we interrupt your brunch to honor the names of victims of police brutality. #blackbrunchnyc pic.twitter.com/k1W3YzYgMF— Sharmin Ultra (@sharminultraa) January 4, 2015 #blackbrunchnyc is the opposite of breakfast at tiffanys. #blacklivesmatter pic.twitter.com/Rd2zxLqrNJ— Naima Pepper (@hafrocentric) January 4, 2015 #blackbrunchnyc at Lallisse on Lexington. #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/EfaXbm9eOG— Reuben Telushkin (@telushk) January 4, 2015 Black women killed by police: Rekiya Boyd, Renisha McBride, Shaniqua Proctor. #blackbrunchnyc #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/6Zgj3VTCcb— Sharmin Ultra (@sharminultraa) January 4, 2015 There were no immediate reports of arrests, and the protests were said to be largely peaceful — though there were reports of verbal clashes with brunchgoers and waitstaff. The manager at Resto NYC tried to literally push one of our comrades in order to push us out. We did not move.— jovitasmagnolia (@JovaLynne) January 4, 2015 #blackbrunchnyc at Penelope. Some stood, some grabbed arms and screamed in our faces. We know which side you're on. pic.twitter.com/tA9BTRJCqi— Reuben Telushkin (@telushk) January 4, 2015 Others appeared to show solidarity with the demonstrators. We're asking brunchgoers to STAND for black life. A good number in the last spot stood or raised their fists. #blackbrunchnyc #BlackBrunch— Reuben Telushkin (@telushk) January 4, 2015 Hella folks stood up for black lives at Lungomare. #BlackBrunch #oakland pic.twitter.com/ZmmNa5Ja8P— BGD (@BlackGirlDanger) January 4, 2015 #BlackBrunch protesters entering Oak restaurants 2 read names of dead.

How dare folks go out for an omelette with friends and family on a Sunday! #blackbrunchnyc #BlackBrunch— Ted (@TBillsss) January 4, 2015 #BlackBrunch might have worked better if it wasn't in January. A lot of white people are dieting right now and just had quinoa at home.— Yale Cohn (@YaleCohn) January 4, 2015 I find #BlackBrunch to be hilarious.
