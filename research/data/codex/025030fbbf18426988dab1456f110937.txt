The march began near Pearl and Burck streets, traveled down West South and West Patrick streets to the Frederick County Courthouse and moved to City Hall. Staff photo by Bill Green Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save About 75 protesters rallied Thursday night to voice their feelings about the violence in Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown, a black man, was fatally shot by a white police officer.The group began at Burck and Pearl streets and moved to West South Street and West Patrick Street to the courthouse. From there, the group moved to City Hall.Dylan Petrohilos, one of the protesters, said the group had no specific leaders."We wanted to express our voice on the Ferguson violence," Petrohilos said. "People are getting tear-gassed expressing their First Amendment rights over a black youth being killed."Watu Mwariama used a bullhorn to speak out against police violence. Some protesters carried signs that stated "Don't Trust a Cop" or "Justice for All."Frederick Police Capt. Richard Hetherington was at Church and Court streets observing the peaceful protest."They had talked to us a few days about this," Hetherington said. "We didn't shut down any streets. We followed them along to make sure no one got hit by a car."Hetherington said the police saw messages on Facebook that indicated there could be as many as 150 people in the protest group."We didn't add any extra officers, we reassigned some," Hetherington said.As the group dispersed at City Hall, many of the protesters said hello to Hetherington in a friendly manner.Finn Sheehy, 4, came with family to the rally because a police officer had shot a man with brown skin.Bob Hanson, of Jefferson, said he heard of the rally through social media. Wearing a black T-shirt that stated "Truth," Hanson said protests such as the one Thursday night were formed through social media."It is seen as an organization, with no 'leader' in charge, but all involved," Hanson said."We are here in support of the need for police to be accountable in the communities they serve," Hanson said. "The best example is what happened to Mike Brown. Police need to have knowledge of the minorities in communities they serve."Hanson said the murder rate for young black men in the nation is a disgrace."It needs to change," Hanson said.
