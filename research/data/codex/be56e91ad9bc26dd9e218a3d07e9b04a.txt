In 2014, dozens of Black Lives Matters demonstrators stormed the tree lighting and Westlake Mall. Black Lives Matter demonstrators say they want people to remember the racial injustice throughout the year. A Facebook page for the event said, "#BlackLivesMatter, Not Black Friday,” and" No school, no work, no shopping, no excuses. Just hit the streets.” Seattle police were in the area to keep the protests peaceful.
