(Leon Halip/Getty Images) New season, same protest. Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins told ESPN he's going to continue to raise his fist during the national anthem this season. Before Thursday night's preseason game against the Packers, Jenkins made the announcement and said he's still not happy with the criminal justice system. Advertisement "Last season, I raised my fist as a sign of solidarity to support people, especially people of color, who were and are still unjustly losing their lives at the hands of officers with little to no consequence," Jenkins said. "After spending time with police officers on ride-alongs, meeting with politicians on the state and federal level and grass roots organizations fighting for human rights, it's clear that our criminal justice system is still crippling communities of color through mass incarceration." Jenkins stuck to his word and his hand was up in the air during the national anthem Thursday night. The safety has been outspoken since last season and has been vocal in his support for free agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Advertisement Last year, Jenkins put his fist up in the air during the national anthem for all but one game. On Sept. 11, he chose not to carry out his demonstration out of respect for those who served and lost their lives on that day in 2001. The 29-year-old said he's looking to spread awareness about those who have "unjustly" lost their lives in the hands of police officers.

"There are many players across the league who have joined me in working toward new legislation and reestablishing trust and opportunities in our communities, and you can expect to see much more of that."

However, as of now Kaepernick won't be found on any sideline. The quarterback remains a free agent as no team has decided to sign him yet. Jenkins told delawareonline.com earlier this month that other teams are being "cowards" by not taking a chance on the former 49ers quarterback. He also believes there are owners looking to make an example out of Kaepernick for his protests last season. malcolm jenkins nfl protests colin kaepernick san francisco 49ers espn Recommended on Daily News Advertisement Latest Football Jets' Jamal Adams requests permission to seek trade: sources Jun 18, 2020 Jamal Adams on Jets contract talks: 'Maybe it's time to move on!'
