Mayor Lori Lightfoot declined Thursday to comment on video from the Brickyard Mall where an officer knelt on a woman, saying it's an ongoing investigation, but promised that the police oversight agency investigating "is doing everything it can to identify the officers and then make an appropriate recommendation.” Advertisement Meanwhile, Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's office said that it was conducting its own review of the incident in collaboration with the FBI. Hours earlier, the attorney for the woman, Mia Wright, demanded a criminal investigation. Also on Thursday, Lightfoot said the city will not tolerate vigilantism after groups of mostly white men patrolled the streets of Bridgeport on Wednesday night in response to a nearby city protest. The situation in Bridgeport frightened and angered many residents and activists who expressed concerns about racism and violence.

The South Side rapper, with his face mostly covered, emerged after a series of speeches from students and activists. He did not address the crowd and appeared to have left a half hour later as marchers continued north on State. The Tribune asked organizers for confirmation of West's appearance, but they just pointed to the surrounding security. According to CNN, West has made a $2 million donation to support the families of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor As the sun set, marchers cheered: "CPD, KKK, how many kids did you kill today?” —Morgan Greene 8:21 p.m.: Large crowds turn out at suburban events to decry racism in aftermath of George Floyd's death More than 400 protesters marched through the streets of Grayslake on Thursday afternoon, decrying racism and police actions in the deaths of African Americans in several recent tragedies across the country. Chanting the names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Laquan McDonald, the crowd stretched about a half-mile and shut down Illinois Route 83 and the entrance to the College of Lake County. The march was one of many similar events held throughout the suburbs this week that have drawn large crowds. Many of the protesters in Grayslake were students from local schools. The protesters, some of whom wore red shirts, carried signs reading, "Black Lives Matter" and chanted, "No justice, no peace, no racist police.” "I'm out here because I'm tired of seeing people who look like me getting killed across the country," said Jeremy Glende, 21, of Gurnee. Advertisement Protesters were trying to broaden the focus, he said, from just one incident to many.

Protesters held signs with messages like "Counselors Not Cops” and "No more CPD in CPS.” Organizers walked around with hand sanitizer and water bottles. The crowd cheered "Books not cops” as students shared stories about the possibilities of what the cost of the police contract could instead fund. Michelle Yisrael, a nearby resident, said she came to the gathering because most of the men in her life, including her adult sons, have had problems with police. "And also I am an educator, and I never thought it was OK for the Chicago Police Department to be in the high schools. That's never been OK with me. "I think it's important for us to think about the fact that black people did not choose to be here,” she said. "We built this place. It's just time for things to change. I would like to see my grandchildren and my great grandchildren have a different experience.” Yisrael said she "will march as many days as my feet will carry me.” Shelia Hamlin, 53, of Englewood, said she came to the event for her nieces and nephews. "I just want to get out here and show my support for the young people and let them know it needs to stop,” she said. —Morgan Greene 7:42 p.m.: Hundreds gather near Lincoln Park High School echoing call to defund police Crowds of hundreds of young people and other Chicagoans gathered at Oz Park near Lincoln Park High School Thursday evening to rally and demand that the city defund the police. Many gathered on the peak of a nearby hill holding signs, clapping and chanting. Protesters rode in bikes and skateboards, performing tricks before the rally organizers started chanting into a megaphone. It was another in a series of protests and marches held around the Chicago area in response to the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Several more were taking place around the region Thursday evening, including another student-led march on the South Side. On the North Side, as protesters clapped and cheered, more than 20 police officers stood at the park's perimeter. The group also called for justice for victims of police violence and demanded the release of all protesters from jails. There were also demands for a civilian police accountability council. According to the city's budget overview, almost $1.8 billion was budgeted for CPD in 2020. As hundreds headed west on Chicago Avenue and Halsted Street, Camille Garst, 23, of Edison Park, kept an eye out for fellow marchers. Garst said she has been involved in a march almost every day since Saturday. "I know there a lot of people going out by themselves but I'm encouraging people to stay together,” she said. "I'm trying to take care of my friends.” Advertisement Garst added she'd continue to march until change is made. "This is what you gotta do,” she said. "Come out until they can commit to policy changes.” —Jessica Villagomez 7:25 p.m.: Police killing of George Floyd amplifies calls to remove school resource officers from CPS Outrage over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis is fueling a local push to get police officers out of Chicago Public Schools. Since Floyd's death, the Minneapolis Board of Education has ended its contract with the local police department. Pressure is mounting for school districts nationwide to follow suit, a movement that was already underway in Chicago. Among the demands of protesters this week, including many CPS students, is for the district to nullify the $33 million contract it entered with the Chicago Police Department in August for school resources officers in CPS buildings. The only board member to vote against it was Elizabeth Todd-Breland, who cited research showing that having police in schools often contributes to the school-to prison pipeline, which disproportionately affects students of color. High school senior Diego Garcia, who lives in Brighton Park, cited the same concern when he spoke out against school resource officers. "The city of Chicago should be investing that money ... in our communities. They should be investing that money in after-school programs and mental health resources," said Garcia, 18. "We don't need more cops. At the end of the day we are just being set up for the school-to-prison pipeline.” The police department is currently reviewing its policies for school resources officers, who are assigned to 77% of CPS-run high schools, according to the district. The contract already includes several reforms to the way police are trained and involved with schools, a shift from reactive enforcement to proactive intervention.

Students from Lake Zurich High School said they wanted to stand in solidarity with black victims of oppression such as Floyd, who died after a police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest in Minneapolis last week. They emphasized they wanted a peaceful protest in contrast to the rioting and looting that occurred following protests elsewhere. "It's just as important to educate white people they need to use their voices to stand against oppression of black people," said co-organizer Zach Richards, 17, who is just graduating from high school. The parents of 15-year-old Dana Fleming wouldn't let her attend a protest in Chicago, so she decided to organize her own event. She said it's important for people with white privilege to "stand up for people of color." Isabelle Jordan, 19, said her research showed there was a Ku Klux Klan rally in the area in 1921, suggesting a racist history to the predominantly white area. Along with students and families, some older residents also show their support. Octogenarians Beryl Ibbotson and Bill Ditman said they hoped the Minneapolis incident would bring about change. Ibbotson called Floyd's death "outrageous and disgusting." "This has gone on for 400 years,” said Ibbotson, who is originally from England but now lives in Hawthorne Woods. "I'm hoping this will be a wake-up call for everybody." Lake Zurich Mayor Tom Poynton said some residents were worried about the rally or questioned why it had to be there, but he reassured them it would be a peaceful. "We need to do better," he told the crowd. "We need to be committed to change." And Waukegan parks commissioner Marc Jones called on those attending to be not just non-racist, but anti-racist, actively working to end discrimination. The crowd stayed silent for about nine minutes in memory of the length of time a police officer knelt on George Floyd before he was pronounced dead. They then made a peaceful march through downtown Lake Zurich. As the protesters marched through town, their chants of "black lives matter” could be heard across the lake. Other demonstrations were scheduled Thursday for the Lake County communities of Waukegan, Zion and Buffalo Grove. —Robert McCoppin 7:06 p.m.: Black and Latino Chicagoans unite to condemn anti-blackness. 'Don't let them divide us.' Latino and black Chicagoans organized Wednesday on the Southwest Side to denounce reports of violence against black people in Latino neighborhoods after protests and looting followed George Floyd's killing in Minneapolis. Many joined peace marches and engaged in other collective actions throughout the city in an attempt to begin the dismantling of the anti-black narrative and avoid more violence between the two communities. Racial tension intensified after social media posts showed alleged Latino gang members in Little Village and Cicero attacking black passersby in those neighborhoods. The social media reports fueled more fear and frustration in the black community, said Jai Simpson, who participated in a Little Village unity march organized by El Foro del Pueblo, a grassroots organization made up of volunteers to promote civic engagement. Although he had doubts at first, Simpson, who is black, joined about 200 people at Wednesday's march because he said he believes the wrongdoings come from a small group of Latinos who do not represent the community as a whole.

"We are aware of the incident that occurred at Brickyard Mall and are currently conducting a thorough, independent review of the matter, including the conduct of the police officers involved,” the office said. "We take law enforcement accountability seriously and have reached out to the family involved through their attorney.” The investigation into the officers' conduct is being done in collaboration with the FBI, according to Cook County state's attorney's office spokeswoman Aviva Bowen. The statement came hours after the attorney for the woman, Mia Wright, demanded a criminal investigation into the incident last Sunday.

Many grocery stores that shut their doors this week during the fallout from George Floyd's death in Minneapolis started to open again Thursday with limited hours, hoping the unrest that damaged dozens of neighborhood businesses had quieted. But some remain closed with no word on when they might resume operations, raising concerns about food access in communities that already had limited options. In South Shore, Local Market, which had been boarded up and closed since Sunday, opened with shortened hours Thursday after hearing from residents who said they needed the store to function because they didn't have food, co-owner Eva Jakubowski said. Parts of the neighborhood had been designated a food desert by the city before Local Market opened in December on a site that had been vacant since Dominick's closed six years before. Looters tried to break in Monday but the store's security guards, with reinforcement from police , fended them off before they caused serious damage, Jakubowski said. On Wednesday, close to 500 volunteers gathered to help clean up the store. "The way the community has stepped up to support their store is something I have never seen before,” Jakubowski said. "So many people are depending on us because they really need us.” Read more here. —Alexia Elejalde-Ruiz 4:03 p.m.: Activists call for investigation into how Chicago police handled George Floyd protests Activist groups have asked the court-appointed monitor overseeing reforms to the Chicago Police Department to investigate and report on allegations that officers abused protesters who flooded the streets last weekend to decry police mistreatment of African Americans. The groups also want the monitor, former federal prosecutor Maggie Hickey, to require the city to discourage officers from arresting protesters. The letter to Hickey, who is overseeing a consent decree that mandates broad changes to the troubled police force, also complains of protesters being detained without contact with lawyers and asks her to establish a process for attorneys to communicate with arrested clients. In the letter sent Thursday, Sheila Bedi, a Northwestern University law professor who is among the attorneys for the groups, wrote: "Clearly, the consent decree entirely failed to provide any meaningful protection to the people of Chicago against CPD violence during the recent protests.” "If the independent monitoring team fails to take decisive, urgent action at this moment, the consent decree will be a historic failure,” the letter states.

I'm the mayor and I want COPA to be doing its job, but doing it independently,” she said. "They have to call balls and strikes. I mean, of course I have my own personal opinion about it, but I'm not going to share it, because I don't want to influence what COPA's work is, they've got to, they have the jurisdiction and the mandate, and more importantly they have my full support to do their job, independently." Lightfoot said it isn't easy to identify officers in a "grainy video” but they are being investigated and once they're identified they'll be reported to Chicago police Superintendent David Brown. Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx released a statement Thursday afternoon saying that her office was conducting its own review of the incident. "The Cook County State's Attorney's Office is committed to public safety and pursuing the fair administration of justice for everyone in our communities. We are aware of the incident that occurred at Brickyard Mall and are currently conducting a thorough, independent review of the matter, including the conduct of the police officers involved. We take law enforcement accountability seriously and have reached out to the family involved through their attorney," the statement said. The mayor, meanwhile, rejected calls from some progressive aldermen such as Rossana Rodriguez Sanchez, 33rd, to defund the police department. "I don't think that's an appropriate action at this time. I think that the people in our neighborhoods want and have been begging for more police support,” she said. "In light of what's happened over the last couple days, it would be irresponsible for me to even entertain any idea that we would cut back on our public safety resources at this time." Lightfoot again reiterated her support for some civilian oversight of police but noted that there remain "a final few issues” her administration is stuck on with activists. "It's my hope that we'll be able to break the logjam and move forward,” she said. —Gregory Pratt 3:44 p.m.: More than 400 protesters — many of them students — march through Grayslake More than 400 protesters marched through the streets of Grayslake Thursday afternoon, decrying racism and police actions in the deaths of African Americans in several recent tragedies nationwide. Chanting the names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and Laquan McDonald, the crowd stretched about a half mile and shut down Illinois Route 83 and the entrance to the College of Lake County. Many of the protesters were students from local schools. They many wore red shirts, carried signs reading, "Black Lives Matter," and chanted, "No justice, no peace, no racist police.” "I'm out here because I'm tired of seeing people who look like me getting killed across the country," said Jeremy Glende, 21, of Gurnee. Protesters were trying to broaden the focus, he said, from just one incident to many. Harper Fischer, a social studies teacher at Grayslake North High School, said she joined the crowd because, "I feel I can't look my students in the face and tell them they're safe in America." —Robert McCoppin Advertisement 3:04 p.m.: Family seeks criminal investigation after they say Chicago cops pulled woman from car by hair and placed knee on her neck The family of a woman who says Chicago police pulled her from a car by her hair and placed a knee on her neck demanded a criminal investigation into the officers Thursday. "I didn't do anything,” Mia Wright, 25, said at a news conference in the parking lot of Brickyard Mall, where she said the officers surrounded her car, broke the windows with clubs and pulled her to the ground on Sunday. "I was trying to get out with my hands up. They continue to break the window, and before you know it I was being pulled out of the vehicle, pulled by my hair,” Wright said, crying. "The officer grabbed me. I had my hair tied in a bun. He grabbed me by the top of my bun and pulled me out of the vehicle. And that is when they threw me on the ground, and he proceeded to put his knee in my neck.” Read more here. —Chicago Tribune staff 2:50 p.m.: Mayor Lori Lightfoot denounces vigilantism in Chicago after white men patrol Bridgeport streets with bats Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the city will not tolerate vigilantism after groups of mostly white men patrolled the streets of Bridgeport on Wednesday night in response to a nearby city protest. Multiple streets were blocked in the Bridgeport neighborhood Wednesday night as nearby protests dispersed. Near West 39th Street, water hurled from an open fire hydrant as small groups gathered on corners. Some of the men held bats. One wore a shirt that said "All Lives Matter,” one sipped a beer and another waved at an officer as he drove by. Additional groups of people, some armed with bats, lined West 31st Street. Asked about the situation in Bridgeport, a diversifying neighborhood that served as an Irish-American power base for the Daley political family, Lightfoot said, "It is absolutely not appropriate for people to take up arms, bats, pipes, whatever in patrolling neighborhoods.” "We've seen that end with tragic results across the country and we're not about to allow that practice to happen here in Chicago. If there's an issue, call 911,” Lightfoot said. "I absolutely support neighbors being vigilant as to what's going on on the streets and in their blocks but taking up arms, that leads to chaos and we're not supporting vigilantism in the city of Chicago under any circumstances.” The situation in Bridgeport frightened and angered many residents and activists who expressed concerns about racism and violence. — Gregory Pratt and Morgan Greene 2:47 p.m.: Illinois AG Kwame Raoul among attorneys general asking Congress for broader authority to investigate policing Illinois Attorney General Kwame Raoul joined a coalition of state legal officers in urging Congress to give them broader authority to investigate "unconstitutional policing,” his office said Thursday. The letter to congressional leaders from Raoul and 17 other attorneys general asks for an expansion of the law enforcement misconduct section of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, enacted three years after Rodney King was beaten by Los Angeles police officers. "Once again, our nation has been called to reckon with police brutality against black people in this country and the systemic failures that cause and allow this misconduct to perpetuate,” the letter states. "Many members of the public have no trust in the police, with tensions visible in the streets across this nation. Urgent action is necessary at all levels of government to remedy the injustice of police misconduct.” Read more here. —Jamie Munks 2:11 p.m.: Kanye West launches college fund for George Floyd's daughter, reveals $2 million in additional donations It's been nearly 10 days since the May 25 death of George Floyd at the hand of a Minneapolis police officer, during which time massive protests against police violence have taken place across the country. But while tens of thousands have taken to the streets to express their anger at the systemic racism that has gripped the United States, the usually vocal Kanye West has been surprisingly quiet. Today the rapper revealed via a representative that he has donated $2 million so far to charities associated with Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor and George Floyd and has set up a college fund to cover tuition for Floyd's 6-year-old daughter Gianna. In addition, the rapper has pledged to cover legal costs for the Arbery and Taylor families. And in his hometown of Chicago, he'll also be aiding black-owned businesses with financial contributions.

Tou Thao, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng were making their first appearances in Hennepin County District Court since their arrests Wednesday. The Minneapolis Police Department fired them last week, along with Derek Chauvin, who is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's May 25 death. Widely seen bystander video shows the white police officer pressing his knee into Floyd's neck, ignoring the African American man's pleas that he can't breathe, until he stopped moving.

Bridges at Michigan and Wabash avenues, as well as State, Van Buren, Jackson, Adams and Franklin streets and at 92nd Street remained closed, according to the city. —Chicago Tribune staff 12:10 p.m.: Illinois expands COVID-19 testing to all and urges those who participated in protests to get tested Testing for the new coronavirus is now available in Illinois to anyone who wants it — regardless of symptoms — at nearly a dozen state-run testing sites, state public health officials said Thursday. The availability of on-demand testing was a key component of moving from phase three of Gov. J.B. Pritzker's reopening plan, which began May 29, to phase four, though officials later reframed it as a goal rather than a requirement. The expansion of free testing to anyone, without the need to display symptoms or have a referral or doctor's order, comes as more businesses have opened and as thousands have taken to the streets in recent days to protest the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. Advertisement The state is encouraging anyone who has participated in mass gatherings to get tested.

The video, which surfaced Tuesday, depicts a chaotic scene where police are dispersing a crowd of demonstrators who had gathered along Jefferson Street in Joliet in protest over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. O'Dekirk, a former Joliet police officer, appears to grab a protester by the collar and forcibly walk him backward to a police vehicle. The two then fall to the ground when another man appears to jump on O'Dekirk from behind. O'Dekirk said he would not resign or apologize, and has maintained that he was acting in self-defense.

"He was, from the beginning, trying in his humblest form to show he was not resisting in no form or way,” said the friend, Maurice Lester Hall, 42, who was tracked down Monday in Houston, arrested on outstanding warrants and interviewed by Minnesota state investigators. "I could hear him pleading, 'Please, officer, what's all this for?' ” Hall said in an interview Wednesday night with The New York Times. Hall recounted the last moments with Floyd on Memorial Day, May 25, after they had spent part of the day together.

But that — along with nervous shoppers finding narrow entry corridors through back doors and between shattered glass — was the bittersweet mix of cautious optimism and painful reality that greeted the resumption of Chicago's retail and dining operations from 75th Street to the Southport Corridor, as modified for a coronavirus-scarred reality that had collided with the fallout from the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.

See all newsletters. Indeed, it took decades to even get to the starting line of reforming the historically troubled Chicago Police Department. The police union strongly pushed back, and politicians disagreed on the need for significant change. Overhauling the nation's second-largest police force is a task of daunting scope.
