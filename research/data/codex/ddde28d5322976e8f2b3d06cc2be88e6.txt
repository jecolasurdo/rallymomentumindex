Posted: Jun 9, 2020 7:13 PM Updated: Jun 10, 2020 10:43 AM Posted By: Chelsea Hunt EUGENE, Ore. -- Part of Interstate 105 was shut down due to a Black Lives Matter protest, police said Tuesday. Protesters moved south from the Valley River Center to downtown, and initially the on-ramp at Coburg Road was closed, but police extended the closure to the westbound and southbound lanes of I-105 at about 7 p.m. About thirty minutes later, the highway reopened, but the ongoing protest led police to close it down again. Police are advising drivers to avoid the area and use caution as the area will be congested. This is the 12th night of protests in support of Black Lives Matter in the city.
