FALL RIVER — Standing in front of the Fall River Justice Center, in a group of about a dozen protesters who held signs and made impassioned pleas to reform a criminal justice system they said discriminates against people of color, Everett Hoagland told the gathering he'd like to go "old-school.” By that he meant leading an improvised protest chant. So Hoagland, a professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth and New Bedford's poet laureate emeritus, commenced it by shouting: "What's the matter?” "Black lives matter!” the people around him responded. The chant, with several variations, continued for a minute. Many in the crowd were lawyers, law students and other legal professionals. They chanted. Some of them spoke. Their signs bore similar phrases: "Public Defenders say, 'Black lives Matter.'” "Attorneys say, 'Black lives matter.'” "Lawyers say, 'Black lives matter.'” "We know that poor people and people of color are dehumanized all of the time in the criminal justice system,” said Christian Williams, a Boston-based criminal defense attorney who previously worked in the Fall River office of the Committee for Public Counsel Services. "It's not just out in the streets. It's not just the brutality that people suffer; the deaths that people suffer. It's where people are arraigned. It's where people go into trial. It's the endemic racism in the system,” Williams told the gathering. "Between bail and sentencing, black people are disadvantaged at every turn in the criminal justice system.” Similar groups of legal professionals gathered in front of other courthouses across the commonwealth in a day of action called for by the National Lawyers Guild of Massachusetts, the Massachusetts branch of the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups. That national Black Lives Matter movement has been ongoing since the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, Tamir Rice in Cleveland, Ohio, and Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York. Fall River's gathering was organized by Benjamin Evans, a supervising attorney at the public defender's office in the city and a member of the National Lawyers Guild. "It's just a show of solidarity with this movement that's been led by young black men and women from Oakland to Staten Island, just to express that there are people who work in these courts who see what those young people are saying and who agree, yes, the system is inherently racist, white supremacist and yes, black lives do matter,” Evans said. Demonstrators said racial injustice is apparent in other institutions, not just the criminal justice system. "You see it in just the cumulative humiliation and difficulties people encounter in contacts with every kind of institution, from hospitals to housing authorities, to lenders, to economic activity,” said Deborah Roher, an attorney whose practice is focused on civil litigation. Those who participated also read the names of people who, according to Evans, died at the hands of police since 1975. As they recited those names, Hoagland added a name that wasn't on the list: Morris Pina, a New Bedford man who died in a city police cell in 1990. Pina's family eventually won a wrongful death suit against the New Bedford Police Department after a multi-year fight, Hoagland said. "It starts systematically in this country way back in the 1780s, with the Constitution, when in the country African-Americans were considered three-fifths of a human being. Their lives don't matter as fully as privileged white lives,” Hoagland said. "It's not just about black lives. Black lives matter, human beings matter. We are a targeted group of people in this country. We are targeted by racial profiling. Our communities are considered combat zones, war zones. Our police departments have become increasingly militarized,” Hoagland said. ”All too often, they come as if they're going to war in Afghanistan.” Sign up for weekly e-mails Site ServicesSupport Local BusinessesMy ProfileWork for UsSubscribeSubmit your newsPay Your Ad BillMarket PlaceHomesFall River SchoolsClassifiedsDealsCommunitiesWicked Local SwanseaWicked Local BerkleyWicked Local DightonWicked Local North AttleboroughWicked Local RehobothWicked Local SomersetWicked Local TauntonWicked Local Westport © Gannett Co., Inc. 2020.
