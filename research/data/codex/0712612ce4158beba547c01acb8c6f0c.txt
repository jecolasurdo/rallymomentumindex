Outrage brewing online over a Snapchat screenshot showing two students wearing blackface with a caption saying "We for racial equality boys. Bout to get this free college now that I'm black let's gooooo #blacklivesmatter," boiled over with students demanding action from the University.Makala Johnson, a Junior at UT says she felt the caption with the image belittles the hard work that people put in to earn their education. "We want to get the attention of the administration. This is not the first time this has happened here. In 2002 there was a blackface issue where was 5 fraternity boys that did blackface and situation was dismissed. There was no action taken so at this point we're ready for action."Students took turns speaking and sharing their thoughts and experiences, then embarked on a march down Pedestrian Walkway holding signs saying "We all bleed the same color," and "We have the right to put our money where our mouths are." The University issued a statement calling the incident "repulsive" and "abhorrent." The official statement says that due to Federal Law, the University is not allowed to disclose any punishments students may face, if any.Some students at the event also addressed recent comments made by Interim University President Randy Boyd regarding Sex Week.
