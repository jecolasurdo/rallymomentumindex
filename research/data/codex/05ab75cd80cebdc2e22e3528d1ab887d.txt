The group gathered outside the Dane County jail, with a group of University of Wisconsin-Madison students marching up State Street to join them. After a few speakers, the crowd of about 250 marched around the Capitol Square and throughout the downtown area, ending at the City-County Building. MICHELLE STOCKER Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save About 250 protesters marched through downtown Madison Tuesday afternoon in solidarity with those protesting in Ferguson, Missouri, listing their own set of demands for change locally.The protesters chanted, "Black lives matter,” "Hands up, don't shoot” and "No justice, no peace, no racist police,” spurred by a grand jury's decision not to indict a white police officer in the shooting death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown this summer.The group, led by the Young, Gifted and Black Coalition, has three demands: no construction of a new Dane County jail, immediate release of people incarcerated due to crimes of poverty and investment in initiatives led by young black communities. "We here in Madison are going to work to end all state violence,” said organizer M Adams.She said state violence in Madison may not look like police brutality, but instead like mass incarceration.Wisconsin has the highest incarceration rate of black men in the country, and Dane County and Madison have come under scrutiny lately for their racial disparities in poverty and prisons. The group gathered outside the Dane County jail, with a group of University of Wisconsin-Madison students marching up State Street to join them. After a few speakers, the crowd of about 250 marched around the Capitol Square and throughout the downtown area, ending at the City-County Building. "We are not violent, but our feelings and our souls are on fire,” said Eric Upchurch. "This is not an attack, this is a cry for help.” Click here for the latest updates from local businesses In these challenging times, our local businesses need your support.

Following the rally, the crowd gathered on the steps of the City-County Building and about half of the demonstrators streamed inside to testify in front of the county's Public Protection and Judiciary Committee in opposition to plans for an expansion of the jail.As County Board Supervisor Leland Pan was headed into the building for the meeting, organizers asked him to say a few words."I want to hear your voices, I want you to hold me accountable,” Pan said. At the meeting, he and other supervisors heard from a multitude of speakers, sharing their personal experiences in jail or those of loved ones. The committee had to move the meeting to the city council chambers to accommodate the crowd of people. As the meeting carried on a few floors above, Mayor Paul Soglin, Police Chief Mike Koval and other community leaders held a press conference expressing their reaction to the events in Ferguson and talking about ways Madison can move forward.Koval highlighted the role of police in the afternoon's protest as they walked alongside protestors, assisting them and blocking off traffic along the route. "What you saw was police acting not as a barrier, not as an imposition, but to foster and facilitate those rights that we all hold true,” Koval said. "This is the logical mechanism of police and community engagement at its finest hour,” he said.Leaders from 100 Black Men, the Urban League of Greater Madison, the Boys and Girls Club, Nehemiah Center, the African American Council of Churches and Centro Hispano all spoke about the steps Madison has already taken to address racial disparities and the changes still needed in the community."This is a unique time for us,” said Derrick Smith of the Urban League of Greater Madison. "The key is what do we do when this is not in the spotlight? When the kids go home, do they have a home? When the parents go home, do they have a home? How do we get these families jobs, sustainable jobs? How do we get them jobs so they can get their kids to school?” Dr. Floyd Rose, president of 100 Black Men of Madison, outlined three main problems that need to be addressed nationwide: the absence of respect for all lives, underrepresentation in policy-making and disparities in income, education and access."As a community, we have to make sure we continue to invest in the lives of our young people,” said Michael Johnson, CEO of Boys and Girls Club of Dane County. "When I see these young people out there today – they want to be heard,” Johnson said.Soglin thanked all the groups for the work they do in the community and for addressing the community's needs before tragedies similar to Ferguson take place. "We don't know from one day to the next when there may be violence in the community,” Soglin said, "but certainly because of the presence and the work that is done by these folks and these organizations day in and day out, year after year, that significantly changes the probability of the kinds of tragedies that we've seen in other communities.” In response to the rally's demands earlier that afternoon, Soglin noted he has not supported the county jail and said he has been working with the courts in trying to get homeless people and others living in poverty from being overburdened by fines."We have to double down on looking at alternatives to brick and mortar traditional punitive models,” Koval said. "We have to do more in terms of galvanizing restorative justice court. We have to do more about mentoring folks that are dealing with reentry issues.” "There's much work to be done,” he said, "and the challenge is to think beyond or out of the box in terms of trying some of these new paradigms, because obviously the old ones are failing us miserably.” Until its demands are met, the Young, Gifted and Black Coalition plans to organize action every week, with updates on its Facebook page called Ferguson to Madison."We are a group of young people who are energized and committed to taking action to the streets,” Adams said.
