The group, made up of people from Ferguson, Missouri and Northeast Ohioans, demonstrated downtown during the Cavaliers game at Quicken Loans Arena. The reason for the protest is because of what they are calling 'police brutality' in the cases of Tamir Rice, 12, of Cleveland, and Michael Brown, 18, of Ferguson. Both died after confrontations with police. "Stand up, don't shoot,” the crowd yelled on Sunday as they marched down city streets. "I don't know if it's proper training the officers need, or background checks that need to be handled but something definitely needs to happen,” said a Ferguson resident, who chose to be identified as 'Justice Seeker'. Cleveland's Police Chief, Calvin Williams, was present on Sunday as the group of about 40-50 marched and rallied. At one point the group tried to push through police barricades at Carnegie Avenue near I-90 West and I-71 South, but were unsuccessful. They ended their protest at Public Square. "This incident in Cleveland is not an isolated incident and this happened to hit home, but it has happened across the nation,” said Chantay Jordan, a Cleveland native. Also, Sunday night, several people spent time at the Cudell Recreation Center where Rice was shot and killed back in November. Cleveland police thought his airsoft BB gun was the real thing. Those attended that gathering lit candles, and some also participated in a toy drive which was meant to support the boy's classmates. "This is great, but where's the numbers,” Jordan said. Jordan, along with a few other protestors, expressed disappointment that more people did not show up to the weekend demonstrations and events. "I will say that I am disappointed in a lot of the people from Cleveland,” said a Ferguson resident. "You've got to let the kids know the real because it's scary times, it's scary times right now--America needs to talk about it we need to talk about it, we need to tell our kids about it,” Jordan said. Sunday's vigil was the last planned event by the out-of-towners. Cleveland police have confirmed to Fox 8 there were no protest-related arrests made over the weekend.
