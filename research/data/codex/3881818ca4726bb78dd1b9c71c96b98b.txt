Business owners have a right to protect their goods and property, just as the businesses did in LA during Rodney King. During this time if you steal, damage property, or assault officers and innocent bystanders,.then you're a criminal. Report Add Reply DesertDonna52 May 30, 2020 11:49am These people are uninformed idiots. The cop has been in custody since yesterday morning, charged with murder. He'll go to prison. Report Add Reply 11BRetire May 30, 2020 9:07am Do a peaceful protest all you want. That is your right under the 1nd Amendment of our constitution. But if you start to riot here by looting, burning, hurting or kiIIing people. The kid gloves comes off! For many Nevadians have firearms and now how to use them.... and we will if you riot in our neighborhood.
