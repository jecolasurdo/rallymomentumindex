SoundThe gallery will resume insecondsShow Caption of ExpandBy Janet Zimmerman | Press-EnterpriseFebruary 29, 2016 at 5:47 p.m.More than 60 UC Riverside students staged a "die-in” today, Feb. 29, to call attention to crimes against Black students at other colleges and to push campus administrators to issue a statement condemming such actions. Students of all races joined the demonstration by lying silently on the hot pavement in the outside eating area of the student union. The hour-long rally ended with a noisy march to UCR's administration building, where participants called out for Chancellor Kim Wilcox. Organizer Alexander Wilson of the Black Student Union said the event was a sign of solidarity following two recent incidents, one at UC Davis and the other at San Jose State University. On Feb. 15, three white men threw things and shouted racial slurs at a Black female student at UC Davis. The university administration issued a statement the next day calling the attack, which has been classified as a hate crime, unacceptable. At San Jose State, several white students were charged with calling their Black roommate racial slurs, hanging a Confederate flag in their living room and putting a U-shaped lock around the man's neck. UCR's lack of response "indicates to us a lack of care for the students of color on campus,” Wilson said. Wilcox came out of his office to meet with the students, along with James Sandoval, vice chancellor of student affairs, and Paul D'Anieri, provost and executive vice chancellor. They agreed to immediately craft a statement against the UC Davis attack and run it by Black student leaders in the next several days before releasing it in a campus-wide email. The university leaders also vowed to develop a protocol for addressing future hate crimes on other UC campuses. "We should have immediately reached out to the Black student leadership to talk about what happened at UC Davis and that didn't happen,” Sandoval said. "If it were my daughter, I would look to that campus administration for support.” Newsroom Guidelines News Tips Contact Us Report an Error Get the latest news delivered daily!
