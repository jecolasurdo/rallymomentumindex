(WIAT) — The justice department is looking into a deadly shooting. The victim was shot by a police officer in North Charleston, South Carolina. The officer was charged with murder after he was caught on camera, shooting a man from behind. Demonstrators repeatedly disrupted the North Charleston mayor and police chief as they updated reporters about Saturday's shooting of an unarmed black man. Wednesday afternoon hundreds of people showed up outside of city hall to peacefully protest, however they were both loud and angry. It started with one man with a megaphone, and quickly turned into a movement from a parking lot, to the street, to the middle of traffic. Many came to the rally holding signs, while others came with just their voice. Protesters took to a microphone one by one to talk about their experiences with the North Charleston Police. Officer Michael Slager was charged with murder after a cell phone video surfaced, showing him firing eight times at Walter Scott, 50, as Scott ran away. "I have watched the video, and I was sickened by what I saw,” said Chief Eddie Driggers. North Charleston's mayor visited Scott's family. "The mother and father are wonderful people, and the other family was there,” said North Charleston Mayor Keith Summey. "They are suffering.” Nicole King, friend of the victim's fiancee, was in the crowd of protesters and said she became overwhelmed. "We saw Ferguson, we saw New York, L.A.,” King said. "God is tired. Wake up nation. I have to stand up, not only for blacks, but for everybody. It could have been any one of our children.” Officer Slager pulled Scott over Saturday for a broken taillight. Police hope to release dashcam video they said will show more of what happened leading up to the shooting. Officer Slager claimed he feared for his life as the two struggled over his Taser, but sell phone video shows Scott ran away before the officer started shooting. Despite the officer being fired and put in jail, the shooting is sparking outrage in this community. North Charleston has now ordered body cameras for all of its officers. North Charleston Police say it's unclear whether any other officers seen in the video will face charges. Although the officer was fired, the city will continue paying for his health insurance because his wife is eight months pregnant. Copyright 2015 WIAT 42 News Copyright 2020 Nexstar Broadcasting, Inc.
