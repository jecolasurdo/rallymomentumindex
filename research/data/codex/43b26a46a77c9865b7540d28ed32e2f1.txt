Dozens of protesters showed up Saturday night to protest the death of George Floyd. The protest started in front of Hoover City Hall and protesters marched along Highway 31 calling for an end to police brutality. At least one person was detained by police during the protest, although it is unclear why. The Shelby County Sheriff's Office responded to assist the Hoover Police Department. The demonstration is part of a nationwide movement following Floyd's death on Monday, May 18. In Hoover, people brought signs reading, "Black Lives Matter” and chanted, "No justice, no peace.” Many of the protesters demonstrated earlier Saturday at Kelly Ingram Park in Birmingham. The group plans to reorganize at Kelly Ingram Park at 1:30 p.m. Sunday.
