Police said an angry crowd hit one officer in the head with a brick, set fires and shot guns in the clashes on the city's North Side. Officers decked out in riot gear made at least three arrests as firefighters rushed to put out the blazes.

"If you love your son, if you love your daughter, text them, call them, pull them by the ears and get 'em home." Over 100 people protested Saturday night in Milwaukee in demonstrations that turned violent. (Calvin Mattheis/Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel via AP) The uproar followed a traffic stop and chase around 3:30 p.m. according to Milwaukee police. The 23-year-old man killed by police and another suspect ditched a car and ran after the stop at N. 44th St. and W. Auer Ave, investigators said.

The officer ordered him to drop the gun, but hit him in the chest and the arm when he didn't, cops said. Milwaukee police said at least one officer was hospitalized and three squad cars sustained damage during the violent protests Saturday night. (Milwaukee Police via Twitter) Barrett said the officer was wearing a body camera. Officers captured the other suspect after the shooting, police said. Over 100 people demonstrated near the scene of the shooting in protests that started out peaceful, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The protest devolved even after a woman who identified herself as a family member of the dead man asked everyone to leave.

Yet firefighters could not put out the blaze at first because gunfire had erupted nearby, police said. Barrett said at least four buildings were set aflame during the chaos. The Milwaukee police tweeted an image of an empty squad car with its windows smashed. The demonstrators set another cruiser on fire and busted the windows of a third squad car, police said. A police officer took cover behind a car at one point during the protests, and local journalists said they feared for their safety as well and left.

Assistant Chief James Harpole told reporters early Sunday the crowd had finally begun to go home.
