The meeting, on Tuesday, April 9, followed the same pattern as the previous one, and continued months of tense interactions between the council and protesters who want the Police Department to release dash- and body-cam footage from a December shooting that left Christopher De'Andre Mitchell, suspected of being in a stolen car, dead. The council, led by Furey, has sought to maintain order amid outbursts from the audience. The protesters, meanwhile, have used disruption as a means to try to force the city's hand, to release the videos.

Council members have also said they haven't seen the tapes. "In terms of bringing awareness to the shooting and his death, I do think it's working,” said Peter Carr, one of the lawyers for Mitchell's family. "Do I think that the city is going to now all of a sudden release things? I don't know.” Related Articles LAPD investigating San Gabriel attorney for allegedly calling for cop killings Senate GOP proposes policing changes in 'Justice Act' Trump signs executive order pushing police reform measures LA Unified chief calls to end school police use of pepper spray and policy allowing chokeholds Garcetti won't support Black Lives Matter push to defund the LAPD Within an hour Tuesday, Furey called for two separate 10-minute recesses, saying the said Black Lives Matter protesters violated the council's rules of decorum. And for the second week in a row, protester Evan Regis Bunch was removed from the meeting after shouting expletives at the mayor. Furey declined to comment Wednesday. Bunch was the only protester kicked out both weeks. But after the recesses this week, other protesters acknowledged the disturbances. "We're not going away,” said protester Ian Jameson. "We're going to make all your lives a living hell until you do the right thing and release that body cam footage.” The protesters, who have shown up to every council meeting this year, also want Torrance to create an independent, civilian oversight commission for the Police Department. Typically, Sheryln Haynes, Mitchell's mother, is a fixture at the council meetings, asking for the tapes to be released. But she is also accompanied by the Black Lives Matter protesters. This was the first meeting she's missed this year, with her family saying she was in Sacramento as lawmakers moved Assembly Bill 392, which would limit the justifications for officers using deadly force, out of the Assembly's public safety committee; it next goes to the rules committee. Haynes' family was at the meeting in her stead — again accompanied by the protesters. Councilman Tim Goodrich, in an email, acknowledged the protests can disrupt meetings. "While it may take longer than usual,” he said, "we will still get the work done that we were elected to do and I will continue to work to move Torrance forward.” Councilman Aurellio Mattucci agreed. "It makes some of us nervous,” he said. "We have to constantly take breaks to try and stop the yelling and shouting. "And it's unfortunate for the people who actually want to have an intelligent conversation,” Matucci continued, "because they bring up a lot of good points.” Editor's note: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated where in the legislative process Assembly Bill 392 was. It recently moved out of the Assembly's public safety committee and will next go to the rules committee. The story has been updated.
