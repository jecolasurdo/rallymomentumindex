"We have to be one. We're a unit. We're a team. The United States is a team."On Monday, IU coach Kevin Wilson said he supported his player's message, saying Fant raised his fist in a "class way.""I appreciate his comments," Wilson said at his weekly press conference. "'We're one as a team. We're one as a country.' That's all we talk to our team about."Fant was the latest athlete to follow the footsteps of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and make a public demonstration during the playing of the national anthem.Wilson said the team discussed in the preseason the importance of being respectful of what the American flag stands for and of the people who have served the country."We - our school belief - you're a citizen first," Wilson said. "But we also want to represent our school the right way."Wilson credited IU's players for standing during the national anthem. During home games, the Hoosiers are still in the locker room at Memorial Stadium, so Saturday's game at Ohio State provided one of the few on-field opportunities for a public demonstration by an IU player.IU athletic director Fred Glass told a faculty council meeting that there would be no repercussions against Hoosier student-athletes for participating in protests against racial injustice.Fant then backed up his pregame statement on the sideline with his play on the field, Wilson said."What I really appreciate is he plays well enough," Wilson said. "It's one thing to talk but when you play, I appreciate the way he played and I think it's one thing to be a guy talking but when a guy's performing ... I respect he came out and played a good football game."​Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Public Notices Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My AccountSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJob Network Cars.com Louisville Homes Classifieds Education Moonlighting Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2020 www.courier-journal.com.
