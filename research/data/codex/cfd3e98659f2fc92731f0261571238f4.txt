Here are the players who protested in Week 15:San Francisco 49ers: As they have all season, Kaepernick, safety Eric Reid and outside linebacker Eli Harold knelt during the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Atlanta Falcons. Reid, who is recovering from a season-ending arm injury, traveled with the team and knelt again. -- Nick WagonerPhiladelphia Eagles: Safety Malcolm Jenkins raised a fist over his head during the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Ravens. He has been protesting since Week 2 against the Chicago Bears. Cornerback Ron Brooks typically protests with him but has not been present on the sideline the past eight games, after undergoing surgery to repair a ruptured quad tendon. In early November, Jenkins discussed at length his reasons for protesting. -- Tim McManusTennessee Titans: Following the national anthem before the Titans' game against the Chiefs, linebacker Wesley Woodyard, cornerback Jason McCourty and defensive linemen Jurrell Casey, Al Woods and DaQuan Jones all raised a fist in the air. -- Paul KuharskyMiami Dolphins: Wide receiver Kenny Stills and safety Michael Thomas knelt for the anthem before the Dolphins' game against the Jets on Saturday night. They've done so for every game this season. -- James WalkerLos Angeles Rams: Defensive end Robert Quinn raised his right fist during the national anthem before Thursday's game against the Seahawks, as has been his custom since the start of the regular season. Quinn, who was inactive for the game, said he will continue to do so regardless of whatever backlash he receives on social media. Said Quinn: "People have the right to voice their opinion. It's up to you whether you listen to it or not. If people feel bad or feel upset about making a stand, that's their personal opinion and judgment. At the end of the day, I'm just standing up for what I believe is right." -- Alden GonzalezSeattle Seahawks: Seahawks players linked arms during the anthem before Thursday's game against the Rams, just as they've done for every regular-season game this season. -- Sheil Kapadia FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmail
