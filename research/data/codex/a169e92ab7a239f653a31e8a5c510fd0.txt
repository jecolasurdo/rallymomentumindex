The peaceful demonstration mirrors similar protests across the country in the effort to raise awareness against social injustices. More than 60 students participated in the silent protest, wearing black clothing and raising their fists in the air during the playing of the anthem. "We just came to let people know that it's time for a change,” Nicole Telfer, a silent protestor said. "It makes everybody aware that we're not going to stand for police brutality,” Marquan Boyd, another silent protestor said. Crowd response was civil and some spectators weighed in on the protestors and their actions. Bill Rehill respects freedom of speech, but states he has "some issues with that and at the end of the day, that's what our country's all about.” "They say with their fists and I really don't mind, as long as they're not bothering anybody else, it's fine,” Linda Echard, another spectator said. Penn State's NAACP chapter organized the event mainly through word of mouth and social media. Shanta Mills, the chapter's president, said the volleyball match was a great opportunity to gain attention. "Our organization understands that just by sitting in is not going to bring immediate change or anything,” Mills said. "I guess what we're hoping is that people will be more willing to talk about these situations.” Silent protestors stayed for the entirety of the game to show support for what was a huge game against Minnesota.
