"I think it's a profound tragedy when anybody with mental illness or anybody loses their life in the city,” Tory, who sits on the civilian oversight board, said addressing the group.But, because of the Special Investigations Unit probe underway, "it would be entirely inappropriate ... for us to comment,” he said, referring also to Saunders, who was seated nearby.Loku, 45, was fatally shot on July 5 during a confrontation with officers at an apartment building in northwest Toronto subsidized by the Canadian Mental Health Association. Witnesses said he was wielding a hammer at the time..The protest was organized by members of Black Lives Matter, who wanted the board to say when the 84 recommendations contained in Justice Frank Iacobucci's report will be implemented.His report followed the 2013 shooting of Sammy Yatim, an 18-year-old who died on a Toronto streetcar after being shot eight times. Toronto police officer James Forcillo faces attempted murder and second-degree murder charges.Iacobucci's report, released a year ago, includes recommendations on how to deal with "people in crisis,” and suggests the use-of-force model be revised to ensure lethal force is used only as a last resort. "The Iacobucci recommendations have been approved, and they're in the process of being implemented fully. Any death, and the death of Andrew Loku, is a matter of profound sadness and sorrow for all us,” Mukherjee said."None of us want one more life to be lost because we didn't do all that we should have done or could do,” said Mukherjee, who steps down Aug. 1.After the meeting, Saunders acknowledged that, "of course we've got issues and we've been working on relationships.” He said there are committees working to come up with solutions, not "just identify problems.”Get more Toronto politics in your inboxTake an inside look at what's really going on at City Hall, and find out what it means for you, in our weekly Hall Monitor email newsletter.Sign Up NowThe board Thursday also approved a request from Mukherjee that Saunders report back by September on the "feasibility” of deploying body-worn cameras during informal interactions with community members, as well as in investigative situations.Currently, a pilot project is underway involving about 100 cameras and 90 officers in 55 and 43 Divisions, and on one Tavis team and a traffic services motor squad. The test period runs until next March.SHARE:Report an errorJournalistic StandardsAbout The StarMore from The Star & PartnersMore NewsTop StoriesLOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADSCopyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.
