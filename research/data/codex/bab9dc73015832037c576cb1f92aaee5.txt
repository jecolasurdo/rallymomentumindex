The UTA Progressive Student Union organized this protest in an effort to convince the university to formally condemn police brutality in America. Shay Cohen Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save The voices of about 20 protesters echoed off the campus buildings Wednesday afternoon as members of the Progressive Student Union gathered to condemn police brutality. "The main reason we are protesting is because police brutality is an epidemic,” journalism senior Pablo Arauz said. "We want to be the core activist group on campus.”As the protesters walked on the hot pavement past the University Center, Mark Napieralski, Progressive Student Union president, led them in chants like "No justice, no peace,” "No racist police,” and "Black lives matter.” Individuals were sweating along the way, voices cracking from the strain of yelling."We will show UTA people do care about police brutality,” art senior Napieralski said.The march focused on promoting awareness of the death of black individuals at the hands of police. These include the deaths of Jonathan Ryan-Paul, Christian Taylor, Tamir Rice, Tyre King and Jesse James Romero.Two UTA Police officers trailed behind the protest.The police were there to ensure the group's First Amendment rights were protected, while following the protest group, said Mike McCord, UTA Police acting assistant chief.As several individuals passed the protest, they stopped to shake hands with the officers and thank them for their service. "We appreciate support from the community,” McCord said. "It helps make the job worthwhile.”In the middle of the march, criminal justice senior Kiana Moran shared information with protesters about the criminal justice system.She said many of the people incarcerated have drug problems. According to data sourced from International Centre for Prison Studies, incarceration has increased 500 percent in the U.S. over the past 40 years."They need help, not cages,” Moran said.Moran said she wants criminal justice reform. According to the NAACP, African American people are incarcerated at about six times the rate of white people."We aren't just mad, we want change,” she said.She said law enforcement officers need more training; officers are stuck in a broken system. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a bipartisan organization serving members of state legislation, multiple states have introduced legislation or resolutions to develop and evaluate policing practices."There are way more good cops than bad cops,” she said. "We need to be shaking their hands.”@SamanthaDoutynews-editor.shorthorn@uta.edu Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Samantha Douty Follow Samantha Douty Like our work? Don't steal it!

It's not racist go look it up Report Add Reply Anonymous321 Oct 13, 2016 7:23am Pshhhhh black people are incarcerated at 6 times rate of whites because they commit more crimes. They are being held responsible for what they have done not. Not Cause of who they are smh. So you want to make change in incarceration rates? STOP BREAKING THE LAW!!!!! Report Add Reply Zero Oct 13, 2016 12:39pm Well Anonymous, more white people were the victims of police shootings than blacks. From a Washington Post article:"According to the most recent census data, there are nearly 160 million more white people in America than there are black people. White people make up roughly 62 percent of the U.S. population but only about 49 percent of those who are killed by police officers. African Americans, however, account for 24 percent of those fatally shot and killed by the police despite being just 13 percent of the U.S. population. As The Post noted in a new analysis published last week, that means black Americans are 2.5 times as likely as white Americans to be shot and killed by police officers."Does that mean we should just chalk it up to being because more white people commit crime? No. Nor is it about black people being more likely to commit a crime. From the same Washington Post article:"...Police reform advocates and researchers as well at The Post's own analysis has consistently concluded that there is no correlation between violent crime and who is killed by police officers.""In a report covering 2015 data, Campaign Zero compared violent crime rates of 50 major cities to the rate at which police officers killed people, concluding that there was no correlation."This issue affects all of us, it's just that seems to disproportionately affect blacks. The movement is about ensuring that when a cop unjustly kills ANY civilian, they are justly convicted for that crime. Report Add Reply jackjack Oct 13, 2016 7:01am Shouldn't a protest against police brutality focus on all cases regardless of race? Report Add Reply Zero Oct 13, 2016 12:48pm It did, jackjack. I was at the march. The article didn't mention that there were also signs and chants of "chicano lives matter", "native lives matter", and "our lives matter". The march was about getting UTA to condemn police brutality in all its forms. Like you said, regardless of the race of the victim. It's a crime when any of our fellow citizens have their lives wrongfully taken. Report Add Reply Welcome to the discussion. Log In Keep it Clean.
