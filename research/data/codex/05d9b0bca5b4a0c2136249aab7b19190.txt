Patty Wight / MPBN PORTLAND, Maine — A rally for black lives drew a small gathering of supporters in Portland's Monument Square this afternoon. It's part of a three-day event to build support for blacks in Maine. One of the organizers, who goes by Miss LPK, says she wants to build a black nationalist platform in Maine. "I'm not somebody who's interested in sitting back and saying 'I'll take what you give me,'" she says. "I'm interested in changing things and making permanent change that helps black people here in Maine." Adam Marletta of Kennebunkport says controversial incidents such as the police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, may not feel connected to Maine, but says, "I think that's the wrong way to think. I think that we are kind of all in it together here in Maine, and throughout the country." Marletta says he came to the rally to keep momentum in the Black Lives Matter movement. The rally caught the attention of Hannah Allen of Portland who stopped to listen. Allen says she participated in a candlelight vigil last year for Eric Garner, a black man from New York who died partially as a result of a police chokehold. "I hope that we can all find a way to just stand together and we can stop the corruption in our police system and stop the hate and violence and just come together and live in this world equally," she says. Tomorrow the group will hold a meeting at the Portland Public library.
