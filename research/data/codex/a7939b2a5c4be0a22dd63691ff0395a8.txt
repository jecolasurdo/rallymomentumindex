A Richmond Heights police officer saw Tillman carrying a gun inside the Galleria, and after a foot chase out of the mall, shot Tillman in Clayton about 3 p.m., according to St. Louis County police. In response, protesters traveled through the mall Monday carrying signs reading "Justice for Terry” and chanting for at least 20 minutes, before taking the demonstration out on the street. Several protesters then blocked the intersection of South Brentwood Boulevard and Clayton Road for about five minutes. Police told the protesters to disperse before a group moved to block all lanes of South Brentwood Boulevard at Galleria Parkway for about 12 minutes, according to Richmond Heights police. "We gave them 12 minutes in the roadway and told them, 'You need to disperse,'” said Doug Schaeffler, Richmond Heights police chief.Police officers took two protesters into custody that were blocking the road, according to protesters and police. Police did not release their identities. Official charges are pending, Schaeffler said. No one was injured, police said.Several members of Tillman's family attended the Galleria protest, but declined to be interviewed by the Post-Dispatch.Police have not identified the officer who shot Tillman, but said he is 50 years old and has been a police officer for 23 years.Tillman was wanted on an arrest warrant issued in February after he failed to appear in court on a felony stealing charge, according to court records. He allegedly tried to sell a Chicago-area man a car that had been stolen in Ballwin. He was on probation after serving five years of a 10-year prison sentence for robbing two people in Carondelet Park on Feb. 19, 2013, according to court records.Bryce Gray of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report. 0 comments Tags Public-safety Galleria Protest Terry Tillman Saint Louis Galleria Mall Richmond Heights Police Protester Criminal Law Police Crime Law Law and order St. Louis-area serial killers Law and order 2020 homicide map Law and order Missouri executions Shake off your afternoon slump with the oft-shared and offbeat news of the day, hand-brewed by our online news editor, Mandy St. Amand.
