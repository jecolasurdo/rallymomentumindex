(Chandler West/Staff Photographer) By Michael RomainStaff ReporterThey lay prostrate – motionless and silent – for 4 ½ minutes, a symbolic gesture to quietly protest what many on the floor considered Michael Brown's posthumous dehumanization. After his shooting death, Brown's lifeless body was left to lay sprawled in the middle of the street for 4 ½ hours, much of that time his gym shoes protruding out from a white sheet, his bloodied bulk shielded with "a low, six-panel orange partition typically used for car crashes," according to a New York Times report. The more than 50 sprawled bodies -- students, staff and faculty members of Dominican University in River Forest -- gathered late Tuesday afternoon in an area just off of the entrance to the Rebecca Crown Library. They were here to stage a die-in to protest the decisions by grand juries in Ferguson and New York City not to indict police officers in the violent deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, both unarmed black males. "Oh God, the dignity of all your children is compromised by racism, but we gather today to honor all those who have lost their lives to this sin and to affirm with you that black lives matter," prayed Oak Park resident Claire Noonan, invoking a phrase that's turned into something of a national slogan of protesters across the country. Berto Aguayo, a junior at the university and the student body president, said that the demonstration was conceived at a peace circle hosted last Thursday by two faculty members who convened the forum so that the university community could talk through their responses to the two court decisions. "A lot of the students, myself included, felt that the university needed to express some unified response to everything going on in Ferguson and New York City," Aguayo said. "We felt it was our mission to create a more just and humane world that involves addressing these issues, not remaining quiet, not passing them on, but really addressing them and taking them on and showing solidarity for the people directly and indirectly affected by all these issues," said the 20-year-old. As they lay symbolically dead, Noonan, the university's vice president for missions and ministry, urged the participants to "consider ourselves as the brothers and sisters of those who are lying in the street both literally and metaphorically." The Dominican demonstration was much quieter compared to the more visible public outcries that have occurred across the country. Since November 24, when a St. Louis County grand jury decided not to indict Ferguson, Missouri police officer Darren Wilson, 28, in the shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed 18-year-old, more than 100 people have been arrested in connection with the protests and riots that occurred in Ferguson after the jury's verdict. National unrest was further inflamed by the Dec. 3, decision by a grand jury in New York City not to indict Daniel Pantaleo, 29, the police officer responsible for fatally chocking Eric Garner, 43. Officers said the Staten Island man was arrested for selling loose cigarettes. Demonstrators have since gathered in cities across the country, from New York to Los Angeles, in opposition to what many people now feel is a much larger issue of rampant police brutality and abuse that disproportionately affects minority communities. On Dec. 5, hundreds of protestors in Chicago marched through the Loop and briefly shutdown Lake Shore Drive. Four people were arrested and charged with misdemeanors. "We cannot allow ourselves or our communities to tolerate a system that has criminalized and demonized black and brown youth while agents of the state are rarely, if ever, called to publicly or legally account for their violence," said Leticia Villarreal Sosa, an associate professor of social work at Dominican, in a statement she read on behalf of the faculty and staff at the university. The statement was signed by leaders in Dominican's Graduate School of Social Work, in addition to representatives of Smith College, Portland State University, Columbia University, the Association for Community Organization and Social Administration, and the National Association of Social Workers, among other organizations. "[We are] committing our specific social work skills and expertise [...] to the support of individuals and organizations in Chicago and beyond that are demanding systemic change, supporting those affected by state violence and racism, and promoting healing, restoration and movements for power in communities most affected," the statement read. Anthony Suarez-Abraham, a professor of theology who was one of the faculty members who hosted the peace circle, said that he hopes the demonstration is only the beginning of more consistent social activism. "I hope that this builds into a movement," he said. "I think there have been a lot of terrific responses around the country and Dominican is adding its voice to those. Hopefully a movement develops to address these problematic issues." Suarez-Abraham, a resident of Chicago's Austin neighborhood, said that Tuesday's demonstration received the support of the university's administration, faculty and staff. "From the president down to the faculty and staff, the university is explicitly supportive of not only the response we're seeing today, but there were also many faculty, staff and students at the peace circle," he said. As participants were dispersing, Aguayo alerted them to a flyer listing other social justice events happening around campus and tried galvanizing attention to a matter of practical policy that was much closer to home. Aguayo said that the River Forest Police department and the Dominican University student body were working on drafting a memo of understanding that would maintain a healthy relationship between the two entities. "The memo just details what we expect from each other when we have encounters with one another, it protects our students and it improves the relationship we already have with the River Forest Police department," Aguayo said. "Luckily, I believe they've been really cooperative and really receptive to our advice, so this just solidifies that relationship and makes sure that we prevent any type of police violence, abuse and brutality."

I meant demonstration's that are disruptive, the burning of innocent businesses, the ridiculous looting. There is strength in #'s, I meant go there and help the police stop the violent crime through neighborhood patrol. Walk with a beat cop, not demonstrate in a park. Having many friends who are cops, I know these are decent guys/gals wanting to help, but they become cynical quick because of the unwelcome reception in those neighborhoods.John Q Posted: December 12th, 2014 8:19 PMUncommon Sense: i agree with you. Not necessarily you..but I have actually witnessed people saying there are not marches. Of course, I do not think they meant it literally but when you are debating little details..every word matters. Kate may have intended a different meaning but she wrote this: "@1 Difference, I challenge your assertion that it has been repeatedly shown there are demonstrations over black on black crime." Last Word Posted: December 12th, 2014 4:59 PMOk I would like to have the last word if I may. Good night Mose! Let-em have it Skye. Uncommon and OP Trans, you two should be on the Presidents panel, instead of the hand picked yes men. Symbolic, i'm sorry if your feelings were hurt. Peace be with you. Mose from Oak Park, Illinois Posted: December 12th, 2014 1:05 PMGood night nurse! I don't see any point in continuing this ridiculous back and forth .Winter Skye Posted: December 12th, 2014 12:53 PM@Mose: Nice try at obfuscating yet again. I didn't bring up the Conservatory; YOU did. I said the 'hood of Garfield Park. I was picking one with the most homicides. I could have said Austin, which is #1. My point is that the target of all this passion is the police and the main threat to a Black male in the USA in 2014 is another. Black. male. Get angry 'bout that. It's not "mean"; it's the truth. Dumping all the rage on cops is irresponsible behavior and also destructive and full of denial.RUKidding Posted: December 12th, 2014 11:21 AM@Symbolic, you "totally" lost all credibility when you used words that show your age. I mean for sure. Did you really call him "OP Tranny"? Come on, that is an insult to people who live that lifestyle. How retrograde to use bigotry. LOL. Holder and the President are part of the division between races, according to recent polls. Uncommon Sense Posted: December 12th, 2014 11:19 AMOPT, I think he is saying we've presented a Sophie's Choice between protesting the rare occurrences of police brutality vs the more common black on black violence. He is saying they are against both which of course misses the point. Sophie's Choice is choosing one or the other i.e., which of your two children would you save from death if you could only pick one?OP "Tranny" Posted: December 12th, 2014 9:44 AMsymbolic - I don't get the Sophie's Choice reference. Explain?Uncommon Sense Posted: December 12th, 2014 9:06 AMSymbolic, you moonbats tried to change the conversation to the "system" because after the facts came out, it was clear the racist victimization narrative was not supported. Changing the conversation is the only way you can save face and not look like uninformed idiots.symbolic Posted: December 12th, 2014 12:09 AMI feel depressed living among you people. Even the ones who seem to think they are so progressive are totally retrograde. As for John saying "we've lost the opportuinity to talk about the real issues -- how's that? Let's talk about them. I tried but OP Tranny bounded back to his non existent Sophie's Choice broken record. It's not about these three dead men! It's about the whole rotten criminal justice system. Listen to Eric Holder or Obama. Stop learning from dopes here in the Review!Peace.Mose from Oak Park, Illinois Posted: December 11th, 2014 7:58 PMHow about at least acknowledging that your comment wondering how long Dominican students will breathe if they go to Garfield Park was meanspirited and intended to invoke doom and gloom? I am not ignoring the real injustices experienced by persons of color and would be interested in hearing a variety of opinions on a very complex and important. issue. The conversatory at Garfield Park is a place welcoming to all and would be enjoyed by the Dominican students. Not a stunt. Just a nice time. Winter Skye Posted: December 11th, 2014 6:53 PMI go to the Conservatory at least once a season. I also prefer 'hoods to Downtown locales so again, your doubts are totally off. I am a person of color and perhaps that makes me feel like I belong wherever I go. Winter Skye Posted: December 11th, 2014 6:51 PM@Mose: What is truly sad is that you are resorting to insults and distractions in order to divert attention concerning the REAL emergency, which are Black-on-Black male killings. I don't blame you--it's a bit hard to sling slogans when you're dealing with something like that. In any case, these simplistic stunts are just that--stunts. They are shallow and don't do sht.Mose from Oak Park, Illinois Posted: December 11th, 2014 4:03 PMI have real doubts you actually venture out of your secured location. Seems odd for somewho claims to have been to the conservatory to post a nasty comment daring people to "breathe over by there and launch in to a misguided tirade about choice of transporation methods. I offered a suggestion to all to visit the Garfield Park Conservatory and experience the beauty and wonders of a very special place close to Oak Park. You seem too frightened to ever leave the house. That's just sad. Winter Skye Posted: December 11th, 2014 3:30 PM@Mose: Where in bloody hell did you ASSume that I never visit the Conservatory? I do and I also took the Green Line to get there! Oooo...And guess what? I saw very few Whites on board, as per usual in recent years. So all those lovely liberals checking in here seem to have alternative forms of transportation and if it's the Metra, it doesn't stop at Garfield Park. Do you stroll Garfield Park beyond scurrying to and from the Conservatory?Mose from Oak Park, Illinois Posted: December 11th, 2014 3:19 PMThe Garfield Park Conservatory is one of the great treasures in our area. Free admission to view a magical display of beautiful plantings throughout the year. The annual Christmas event is scheduled for December 13. Not be missed! Winter Syke may too frightened or ignorant to come out and prefer to hunker in the bunker but anyone seeking a wonderful experience that will be enjoyed by all ages should plan a visit. Plenty of free parking nearby and helpful staff will guide and answer questionsOP Transplant Posted: December 11th, 2014 2:22 PMMany people, black and white, are invested in a very old narrative of white oppression and black helplessness. Incidents that support this narrative get a lot of attention; incidents that don't, get less. A thousand black-on-black crimes don't support the narrative, one white-on-black death does. The narrative serves the purpose of perpetuating white political power, and leaves many blacks in a perpetual cycle of crime and poverty. I don't know why so many black Americans support this.Winter Skye Posted: December 11th, 2014 2:05 PMFirst it was wearing a hoodie, in honor of Trayvon. Then it was "Hand's up, don't shoot" in honor of Michael Brown. Now it's #ICantBreathe. Cute slogans but we seem to go from one to the other with our marching shoes on in between. You cannot boil down these issues into sound bytes or catch phrases. Michael Brown's deal (amd maybe even Trayvon) was a bit more complicated and nothing points to racism in the three instances that I have seen. I mean, in an overt way like Emmet Till. Winter Skye Posted: December 11th, 2014 1:56 PMKarma, you need to learn how to interpret stats or else stop thinking that you can pull the wool over our eyes. I found a stat that said that in 2005, approx. 8K Blacks and a little over 8K Whites were killed by their own race. In both cases the vast majority was INTRA-racial. However, Black make up only 12% the population of Whites (one-fifth!). So they are killing their own at a rate of 5X that of WP. THAT is the effing point! It's an epidemic with them. And they project onto the cops instead.The Point Posted: December 11th, 2014 1:51 PM@ John Q you made good points. So did you OP trans. Ultimately this will prove to be a distraction from the real problem. Most people are beginning to get tired of this disruption. Just like people got tired of hearing about the Occupiers. In a couple years new students will come to Domincan and this will all be forgotten. Winter Skye Posted: December 11th, 2014 1:50 PMLovely. Now will they move this show to Garfield Park? Let's see how long they'll breathe over by there!Uncommon Sense' Posted: December 11th, 2014 1:40 PMJohn, there are certainly anti-violence marches. No one has argued that they don't exist. It is the level of outrage that isn't there. No riots. No die ins. No athletes wearing t-shirts. No MSNBC talking heads. It is almost like black on black violence is just expected as the norm. Yet, let a relatively rare instance of a white cop kill a so called unarmed black youth, you'd think it is a new era of lynching from the outrage. John Q Posted: December 11th, 2014 1:03 PMFrustrated...Garner died an hour later in a hospital. How can cops "let" that happen? Better question..how do they prevent that? Symbolic...in the military during runs they would tell us you're not running if you can talk which was their polite way of saying shut up. How the nation has forgotten that people who are talking are breathing I don't know. It is hard to speak at all after a heavy run and you are breathing. What a shift in science.John Q Posted: December 11th, 2014 12:49 PMKate Oberweis a simple google search of anti violence march Chicago turns up marches going back 2 years and that's without searching. Fr. Pflegher, Andrew Holmes and Ceasefire are key words and you will find my marches on the southside than you ever want to see in your life. I've been in several converati regarding these marches you don't remember and stating how while they are symbolic they lack any real power because they pose no economic penalties to anyone and have no political traction.John Q Posted: December 11th, 2014 12:42 PMKate my darling, don't waste your challenge. Ceasefire Fr. Pflegher and other clergy have had so many anti violence marches in Englewood, Roseland and the west side...it became more of yeah, yeah what's happening in sports attitude. The last one I remember this year was a boy being killed and his biological but uninvolved father intwrrupting his news speech and arguing with the boy's aunt who took care of him. They also marched last Christmas when the girl in the south suburbs was killed in aDone from Oak Park Posted: December 11th, 2014 11:14 AMLet's just love every one and be nice to every one. And all this coming from a society that can't even stop for a stop sign.joe from south oak park Posted: December 11th, 2014 9:56 AM+1 to what Jim said.Jim from South Oak Park Posted: December 11th, 2014 9:29 AMAmericans love a victim. Too bad that in casting Mike Brown as a victim, we lose the option of discussing all elements of the issue. Brown was defiant, violent and criminal in his actions. How do you fix that? Just maybe defiance, violence and criminal behavior create poverty, not the other way around. Who is talking about that? And a prayer, too, for Darren Wilson who is going through his own struggles as his life has been uprootedOP Transplant Posted: December 11th, 2014 9:29 AMUncommon - In the Civil Rights era, when discrimination was the primary obstacle to minority advancement, the marches and other attempts at awareness raising made sense. They were effective means of change. But now I feel as though most of our injuries are self-inflicted, both literally and figuratively, and raising awareness only points out the extent to which we need to improve our own families and communities. Marches have become a reflex response. Makes white folks feel good, though.Thanks Posted: December 11th, 2014 9:21 AMThank you for letting us know about the rally, Bob. My family will try to be there. And thank you to the Dominican community for your activism. Uncommon Sense Posted: December 11th, 2014 7:52 AMYet another march backwards while ignoring the real issues with the black community. You'd think after 50-60 years of marching and practically zero progress, someone might stop and wonder if you are marching in the wrong direction.Bob Simpson from Oak Park, Illinois Facebook VerifiedPosted: December 11th, 2014 6:27 AMBlack Lives Matter Sunday 1 PM Scoville Park: An ad hoc group of OPRF religious and community leaders recently met in response to the national conversation on racism and justice. They plan to do a March/Rally/Walk this coming Sunday under the banner #?Black Lives Matter. Be there if you can. Mose from Oak Park, Illinois Posted: December 10th, 2014 8:43 PMThe more people learn about McCollough's efforts to compromise the grand jury process; the harder it will be to "let that one go". A federal grand jury might see the evidence differently or If Brown's parents file a civil suit; Wilson could be subjected to a competent cross-examination. Same goes for the witnesses who offered conflcting testimony or flat out lied on the stand. Witness #40 has already being revealed to have serious credibility issues. Amazing she was even allowed to testify.Frustrated Posted: December 10th, 2014 8:08 PMI stand by the men and women of law enforcement. I agree bad cops should be punished. I don't think MB or EG should be the "poster child's" for this. EG didn't die because he was choked, he died because he was on overweight belly and couldn't breath. The officers who let that happen should be punished. No one "killed" him, they may have let him die which is negligent. Conversely MB attacked, DW defended himself. Let that one go. KARMAX from FOREST PARK Posted: December 10th, 2014 7:56 PMHere is a suggestion to the kiddo's are taking a nap on the university floor. When you're up and refreshed, finish your education and become a police officer. This way you can change the system from within by experiencing it through their eyes. Seeing how you are taught so well at your liberal university how the criminal justice system is supposed to work. Maybe there will be more diversity in these mostly white departments. Symbolic Posted: December 10th, 2014 7:24 PMOP Trans:Wow, Logic 101 where are you when we need you. Anyway, public protest/civil disobedience is a fundamental right in our democracy and one we should be proud of, grateful for and exercise frequently to keep its muscle strong.It also happens to be the most effective change agent going if you've seen a paper the past 150 years or so. Democracy demands participation by definition. This is a great way for our youth to buy into the system -it's their world! Rock your democracy Dominican!!Look Ma I Am Wasting an Education Posted: December 10th, 2014 7:10 PMThe last thing the River Forest Police Department should be doing is drafting any kind of memorandum of understanding with Dominican University. Unless of course Dominican is ready to put in the dollars they drain back out in city services that they currently get for free right now. OP Transplant Posted: December 10th, 2014 5:11 PMSymbolic - I agree with what you say. Still, the police pose much less of a death threat to young black men than other young black men do. Unjustified police shootings are, thankfully, rare. Black on black murders have become, unfortunately, common. If you're real goal is just to hammer the police when they screw up, and you don't really care about the death rate of young black men, riot in Ferguson.Symbolic Posted: December 10th, 2014 4:54 PMThese murders have become the symbolic face of what is two much deeper and more generally disastrous situations in America: The statistically proven institutional racism in the legal justice system is one. Two is the institutionalized process by which the police avoid the criminal justice system themselves. All that doesn't fit on a headline. "I can't breathe" does.The video of cops gunning down a 12 year old sitting on a swing in a park playing with a toy fits a video clip on tv.OP Transplant Posted: December 10th, 2014 4:21 PMThe amount of attention paid to the comparatively infrequent instances when whites kill black victims, as compared to when blacks kill black victims, underscores the unfortunate fact that most Americans, black and white alike, expect one crime and are surprised by the other. Uncommon Sense Posted: December 10th, 2014 4:19 PM@one difference, I believe the Chicago homicide clearance rate is less than 30% (largely because of the no snitching code). In other words, black on black killers aren't being tried and convicted either. In Chicago year to date, police killed 16 and wounded 28. However, 421 honor roll students /aspiring rappers on the way to college have been killed. 2056 wounded. IN CHICAGO alone. www.heyjackass.com for all the stats.One difference Posted: December 10th, 2014 4:04 PMThe argument that "blacks kill blacks and no one cares" is BS. The caring just isn't big news. But equating street crime with death at the hands of police officers is a false equivalency. And the statement about black killers being tried, convicted and punished wasn't refuted just evaded. The argument seems to be that because black criminals kill black youth you can't complain when the police do, too. Do those seem like the same thing? When the police break the law there is no law.Uncommon Sense Posted: December 10th, 2014 4:02 PMKarma, it is a matter of perspective. According to CDC, homicide is the leading cause of death for black males 15-35 years old. Roughly 7000 blacks are murdered annually. There probably aren't 25 legitimately questionable black deaths by cops annually. Many of which are by black cops nonetheless. There is a credibility problem with these protest...One difference Posted: December 10th, 2014 3:59 PMKate, are you saying that demonstrations only count if there are streets blocked or looting? The links posted to demonstration stories are only a handful of the marches and demonstrations that take place. People don't see them because they are peaceful or they only get 2 column inches in the paper. Just because they aren't first on your home page doesn't mean they don't happen. They just don't make headlines.

I say what about white on white crime? Just because you don't see the protests on the news, doesn't mean it's not happening. There are many organizations doing things in the Black community regarding the crime. Quite frankly, those of you who don't frequent those communities, can't really speak on what is being done, can you?Bob Simpson from Oak Park, Illinois Facebook VerifiedPosted: December 10th, 2014 3:16 PMI'm glad to see the students, staff and faculty at Dominican making their voices heard against the police state tactics all too commonly applied to African American neighborhoods.Kate Obermein Posted: December 10th, 2014 3:07 PM@1 Difference, I challenge your assertion that it has been repeatedly shown there are demonstrations over black on black crime. I don't remember any chanting or looting or blocking streets when a 15 year old girl was shot in a drive-by on Sept 1st. 2014. Black life's matter regardless who take them from us. But police are easier news targets. A die-in only gives the students temporary relief, go to Englewood and record the crime on your phone, turn in the criminals, be a witness in court. Uncommon Sense Posted: December 10th, 2014 2:30 PMBlack life has no value unless it is taken by a white person or worse, a white cop. OP 253 is right. Snitches get stitches when it is black on black violence, but everybody and their grandma saw something when it is a white cop shooting a black kid. OP Res 253 Posted: December 10th, 2014 1:56 PM@One Difference, I do not believe that folks believe blacks who kill blacks will be caught, never mind arrested and tried. Because no one ever sees or knows anything. But when a cop is involved, folks that weren't even there know exactly what happened and want to rope up the gallows themselves. Sadly, it's the only time a black death seems to truly matter to any community. And it's not about change, it's about hate. OP Transplant Posted: December 10th, 2014 1:54 PMdizey - From what I can tell from the news media, no white suspect has ever been killed by the police, so we'll never know.dizey Posted: December 10th, 2014 1:40 PMWhen police kill a white suspect, do they get accused and convicted at a lower rate?One difference Posted: December 10th, 2014 1:23 PMIt has been repeatedly shown that the black community has been active in demonstrating against all crime committed in their communities and against black people. Everyone is against that violence. But one big difference is that when black men kill other black men there is a reasonable expectation that if the killer is caught he will be prosecuted and punished. That same expectation isn't present when police officers -- white or black -- kill black men.
