The Tree of Life Justice League and Violence Interrupters organized the protest. The Civilian Office of Police Accountability, COPA, reviewed the case and recommended Officer Robert Rialmo be fired for shooting Quintonio LeGrier and Betty Jones the day after Christmas 2015. But earlier this week Johnson rejected COPA's recommendation, saying he feels Rialmo's actions were justified and within department policy. Read Johnson's full letter to COPA here. Responding to a domestic disturbance, Rialmo shot 17-year-old LeGrier when the teen came out of a door holding a baseball bat above his head. LeGrier's father said the teen was mentally ill. Jones, a neighbor, was also shot and killed. COPA found the shooting unjustified because LeGrier didn't swing the bat at Rialmo and the officer should not reasonably have felt threatened. The Fraternal Order of Police applauded Johnson's decision to support Rialmo. Members of COPA have 15 days to talk with Johnson and submit a rebuttal. Both the Jones and LeGrier families have sued the city for wrongful death. Mayor Emanuel was deposed in connection with those lawsuits Thursday afternoon Officer Rialmo remains on desk duty, stripped of his police powers. 41.878114-87.629798 Close Modal Suggest a Correction Your name(required) Your email(required) Report a typo or grammatical error(required) Submit Suggest a Correction Share this story More News Stories IDES to begin borrowing funds from federal government to meet payment obligations by WGN Web Desk / Jun 19, 2020 SPRINGFIELD, Ill. - The Illinois Department of Employment Security has announced it will begin to borrow money from the federal government to meet unemployment benefit payment obligations.
