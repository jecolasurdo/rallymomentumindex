All are expected to recover, and police says the shots did not come from officers. The protests also resulted in some destruction around the city, including shattered windows, graffiti on buildings, broken statues and more. City and state officials spent Friday making statements about the case and responding to the protests, most calling for people to remain peaceful as they pursue justice. Officers used tear gas, smoke grenades and pepper balls to try and control crowds. Police also said two officers were taken to the hospital with medical conditions spurred by the event. Three people were arrested, but none for the shooting. To prepare for what's to come, all off days for police were canceled. Kentucky State Police will also be on hand to help.
