April 18, 2018. (Frank Abderholden / Lake County News-Sun) Protests against Starbucks were scheduled around the Chicago area and across the country Wednesday, but the one at a Waukegan outlet drew only one protester, who was served free hot chocolate and allowed to go into the store to warm up. "They made the decision to protest too late last night," said Clyde McLemore, founder of Black Lives Matter Lake County, explaining why he was the only one protesting while holding a Black Lives Matter picket sign and planting a "Hate Has No Home Here" sign near the store at Grand Avenue and Green Bay Road.

"I came to make people aware of the controversy in Philadelphia," he said, referring to an incident last week in which two black men were taken into custody at a Starbucks for trespassing after they were told they could not use the bathroom because they had not made a purchase and the two sat down. Advertisement Police arrived a little later and a video shows the two men being handcuffed while customers protested that they had done nothing wrong, including a man who said they were waiting to meet with him, according to the Associated Press.

The issue of protesting at stores stirred some controversy on McLemore's Black Lives Matter Lake County Facebook page, where some argued the protest should be confined to the Philadelphia store. But McLemore said that despite the company's CEO, Kevin Johnson, announcing that the company will shut down stores and corporate offices on May 29 for employee training against racial bias, more needs to be done. "That's not enough. They should pay for these two young men to have their fingerprints and mugshots expunged," he said, adding that they were in custody for nine hours and, even though they were not charged, "They were processed, they're in the system now." McLemore admitted he brought his bullhorn to Wednesday's protest, but decided not to use it because the people running Waukegan's Starbucks were so friendly, and people on his Facebook page insisted it was a good store. They offered him a free hot chocolate, and told him he could warm up inside the store anytime he needed to during his two-hour protest.

Starbucks is collateral damage. This one here is real nice to us," he said, noting there was at least one person of color working behind the counter. Two managers at the store said they were not at liberty to talk to the media. McLemore said he did not harass customers coming into the store, but when one woman replied to his protest by saying "All lives matter," he said he agreed with her. "But if all lives matter, why don't black lives matter?" he said. Stephanie Tellez, 35, of Zion, was sitting near McLemore inside and she said she does business at the Starbucks all the time and the people working there are the best. "Nobody here is ever mistreated. They know everyone by their first name and their order," she said. "I love this Starbucks. It's not fair that one store can give them all a bad name. "I've seen people here just hang out, order a glass of water, and there were no problems," she said. [Most read] Eager to head back to the lakefront?

Usually when I protest I get mad, but I couldn't get mad at you," he said.
