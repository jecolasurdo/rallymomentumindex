News // CrimeProtesters block highway offramp traffic over Mario Woods shootingKimberly VeklerovDec. 23, 2015Updated: Dec. 23, 2015 3:34 p.m. Facebook Twitter Email Comments Eight protesters seeking justice for Mario Woods, a San Francisco man shot dead by police this month, were arrested after they briefly walked onto a Highway 101 offramp Wednesday about noon. Demonstrators blocked traffic for less than half an hour on the San Francisco International Airport offramp, authorities said. Although CHP initially tweeted that nine women were arrested, they later revised the figure to eight. @BLMBAYAREA "WE ARE HEADED TO JAIL. WE NEED LAWYERS IN SAN MATEO/ SF. HIGHWAY PATROL HAS US" #MarioWoods #ShutItDown pic.twitter.com/b9LVekZ078— LolaLolaLola (@Lola_Casanova) December 23, 2015 The protesters were booked on suspicion of obstructing a freeway, false imprisonment, creating a public nuisance and unlawful assembly. Woods, who was black, was shot Dec. 2 in San Francisco when police responded to reports that he had stabbed someone. His family has filed a lawsuit contending he was not threatening the officers when they shot him. A protester tweeted a photo of demonstrators on the offramp holding a Christmas tree painted with the Pan-African colors. "The concept behind the whole protest is that we're stopping business as usual,” said Ronnishia Johnson, a student with Black Lives Matter who came to support the group.
