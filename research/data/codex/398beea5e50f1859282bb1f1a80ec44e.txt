(WWLP) — Together, starting at Agawam High School, protesters demonstrated support for the Black Lives Matter movement with a peaceful march to the Agawam Police Department headquarters. Many held signs calling for change as well as chanting "we had enough” and "say their names.” 22News spoke with Jenni Pacheco, one of the organizers of the event. She told us that controversial social media posts in response to the protest indicate a change needs to be made. "Over 700 comments of negativity—they are not all negative,” said Pacheco. "The amount of hate and violence that we were getting from some of those comments–that's why Agawam needs this right now.” "It takes more than just being okay with people of color,” said Stephany Marryshow, another organizer of the protest. "It takes more than being color blind and saying I don't see race.” Protesters marched down Line Street where the Agawam Police Department helped block off roads for people to safely march. It ended at the Agawam Police Department headquarters where several people spoke on behalf of the movement to the crowd of protesters. Simbrit Paskins of West Springfield and an organizer for the protest said she hopes other people can look at this protest and become inspired to act. "People of color are literally dying and the system is broken,” said Paskins. "That's part of the message we wanted to send today. We are hoping that the folks of Agawam specifically hear that message loud and clear and they are ready to act and that they are engaged and fired up and ready to move.” A moment of silence was held to honor the black lives that were lost by police brutality. A community pastor also joined to hold a moment of prayer.
