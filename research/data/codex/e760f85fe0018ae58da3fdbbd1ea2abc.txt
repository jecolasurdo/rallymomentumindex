Chris Durham dances with Murrieta resident Betty Williams, 66, as they sought to break the tension during an impasse between people protesting the death of George Floyd and deputies at the Temecula Duck Pond on May 30, 2020. (Brian Rokos, The Press-Enterprise/SCNG) By Ryan Hagen | rhagen@scng.com and Brian Rokos | brokos@scng.com | The Press-EnterprisePUBLISHED: May 30, 2020 at 12:55 p.m. | UPDATED: May 30, 2020 at 10:26 p.m.The standoff between full-throated protesters and Riverside County sheriff's deputies who rarely uttered a word from behind their riot helmets and face shields was in its third hour in Temecula on Saturday, May 30. The deputies had responded in force when the crowd protesting the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and what they called police brutality against blacks blocked Rancho California Road between the 15 Freeway and the Temecula Duck Pond on Ynez Road. By 6 p.m., the crowd numbered a couple of hundred and stood in the park about 10 feet apart from the deputies, who at one point had briefly donned gas masks. The protesters defied repeated orders to disperse that included at least a pair of five-minute deadlines and two 15-minute ones to leave that passed without arrests. The impasse had continued on for three hours. But then Betty Williams, a short, 66-year-old Murrieta resident, placed herself between the shouting protesters and the stone-faced deputies. "Do we want to make the laws change?” she asked the crowd. "Yes,” the protesters responded. "Then this is how we do it. Peacefully,” Williams said. She criticized those who have turned otherwise calm rallies into scenes of violence. "Let's not let them tear us down. Let's not let it be that (Floyd) died for nothing,” Williams said. She then trotted out the stereotype that black people can dance and whites can't. She called a white protester in his 20s out of the crowd, and he did what passed enough for a dance to elicit a laugh from the protesters. And then she asked one of the deputies to join her in a little waltz. After a pause, Lt. Chris Durham, a white deputy, stepped forward, took Williams' hand and gave her a couple of spins to the approval of the crowd.

Riverside County deputies almost never speak publicly without prior approval of their commanders. But Durham again stepped up. Speaking for himself, Durham said, "Someone should have intervened. I'm a big believer in accountability – peer-to-peer.” Durham then answered questions individually. The tension broke, the protesters went home and the deputies left. Williams later said in an interview that she last spoke at a protest when she was in college. She said she spoke up Saturday because she noted that most of the protesters were young and may not have realized what their "forefathers” went through to guarantee them the right to protest. "What I wanted to express to them was that there's a way to make change, and it's not by inciting riots,” she said. (Some protesters countered during Williams' speech that peaceful rallies have not been effective in prompting change.) Betty Williams, 66, urges protesters not to riot at the Temecula Duck Pond on May 30, 2020. Demonstrators were protesting the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis and what they described as police brutality against blacks. (Brian Rokos, The Press-Enterprise/SCNG) For Durham, his actions were about timing. "I saw a window of opportunity to resolve the issue peacefully,” he said in an interview. "Somebody needed to say something.” The afternoon protest was the second of the day at the Duck Pond. During the first that began at 10 a.m., a driver struck at least one person, causing minor injuries, sheriff's Sgt. Deanna Pecoraro said. "It's an active investigation but it does not look that it was intentional,” Pecararo said. "No one fled the scene.” The first protest was otherwise peaceful at the Duck Pond, a traditional location for protests, with people lining the street with signs such as "No Justice, No Peace” and chanting "Black Lives Matter.” At times, the crowd reached about 500 people, said Ryan Moore, 39, of Temecula. "There are a lot of people who already have their mind made up on issues like BLM,” Moore said. "But I saw one car that had several kids who were observing the passion and the messages from the crowd. Those kids will remember this day, and hopefully it will help them to decide that they want to be part of the solution.” Protest organizers encouraged people to bring water and wear a mask, as most of the tightly packed protesters seemed to be doing. In Minneapolis on Monday, Chauvin, the now-former officer, was videotaped holding Floyd down, with a knee on the man's neck before he died. As Floyd was being restrained, he said, "I can't breathe,” and onlookers begged Chauvin to ease up. On Friday, Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.
