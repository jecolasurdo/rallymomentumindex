By 7 p.m., all but a half dozen people had left.The crowd stayed on the plaza in front of the courthouse and did not take to the streets, even though a 4 p.m. march had been planned.Judge Leslie Ghiz declared a mistrial in Tensing's trial after 32 hours of deliberations over five days. The former University of Cincinnati police officer faced murder and manslaughter charges for shooting DuBose during a traffic stop on July 19, 2015.Watch video from the demonstration below and in the player above:For complete trial coverage, visit wcpo.com/TensingTrial Brian Taylor of @blacklivescincy says verdict in #TENSINGTRIAL is "blatant injustice" @WCPO pic.twitter.com/9XAkGZ7Rz4— Alberto Rolando (@AlbertoRolandoJ) June 23, 2017 Protestors chanting outside Hamilton County Courthouse after verdict in #TensingTrial @WCPO pic.twitter.com/5U2FkV5q0I— Alberto Rolando (@AlbertoRolandoJ) June 23, 2017 Demonstrators from #BlackLivesMatter outside the courthouse @WCPO #TensingTrial pic.twitter.com/bGJLGrySQN— Libby Cunningham (@WCPOLibby) June 23, 2017 Copyright 2017 Scripps Media, Inc.
