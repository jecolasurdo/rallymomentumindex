August 26, 2017 2:01 AM Hawk Hammer Posted: August 26, 2017 2:01 AM Updated: December 19, 2019 10:25 PM by Hawk Hammer PULLMAN, Wash. — Hundreds of students crowded the French Administration building on Friday for a sit-in protest amid racial tensions on campus. The building echoed with chants of 'white silence is white violence' and 'a people united will never be divided'. The protest was organized by several student organizations, including the Black Student Union, the Asian Pacific American Student Coalition, the Gender and Sexuality Alliance, the Black Men Making a Difference and the Black Women's Caucus. "The administration can longer live with the mind-set that students and their issues can just be swept under the rug,” said BSU President, Chijioke Emera. "Many may argue that WSU is not racist, that the actions of the few do not define the many, however we argue that at any institution where people feel comfortable enough to spew hate and encourage violence says a lot about its climate.” The sit-in comes after in the last few weeks alone, the former president of the school's College Republicans attended the white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, swastikas were drawn in a student dorm followed by two different bomb threats. There were several members of the administration listening in on the protest. "I actually applaud the students for holding our feet to the fire and holding us accountable as we make sure we achieve the goals we have in common,” said WSU VP of Marketing and Communication Phil Weiler. He said he applauded the manner in which the students were going about making their concerns heard. The sit-in focused on presenting a list of five demands to the administration. Those were: 1) Creating a policy defining free speech vs. hate speech. 2) Implementing/requiring cultural competency and ally training for all first year students, staff and faculty. 3) Retaining/Protecting CCGRS and Resource Centers 4) Hiring more staff and faculty of color. 5) Create more gender inclusive facilities and providing free menstrual products in all university bathrooms. Following the protest administrators told the WSU student newspaper they promised a change would happen. COPYRIGHT 2020 BY KXLY. ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
