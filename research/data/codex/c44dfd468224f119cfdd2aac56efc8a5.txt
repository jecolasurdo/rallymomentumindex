Four days later, he watched CNN headlines of Philando Castile's death whip across the television screen well past midnight.His stomach dropped. The 16-year-old son of an African-American woman and white man was more afraid than ever of what his license meant.Castile, a person of color like Bush, had been fatally shot by a police officer during a traffic stop. It was at least the second fatal shooting of an African–American man by police that week. "I'm worried about what may happen to me when I get in the car,” Bush said. "The fact that being a person of color increases the chance of getting shot is fearful for me.”The Chancellor High School football player said some of his teammates likened the Black Lives Matter movement to terrorist activity. Those comments only increased Bush's desire to raise awareness in his community of the experiences of people of color—like the fear that came with getting his license.Bush was among a group of about 30 Black Lives Matter protesters who crisscrossed the streets of Fredericksburg Wednesday night, chanting and holding signs that read "Police should protect, not murder,” "I refuse to be a hashtag,” and "Stop White Violence.”"My parents are scared for me. They're scared of me protesting, too,” Bush said.The protesters chanted "no justice, no peace, no racist police,” among other things. A pastor and an outreach director of two local churches joined the Fredericksburg group."I think it's time to listen and see how we can support each other,” said Carey Chirico, who is white and the outreach director of St. George's Episcopal Church in Fredericksburg. She brought sandwiches and water for the Fredericksburg protesters.Hours earlier, 20 Black Lives Matter protesters held a similar demonstration in front of the Stafford County Courthouse, where they said they received a more hostile response than in previous protests in the city."We don't want our sons and daughters to grow up like this,” said Philomena Wankenge, an 18-year-old Stafford resident and Congo native who organized both Wednesday protests and a July 13 demonstration in downtown Fredericksburg. "We believe Stafford has a lot of racial issues that are never addressed ... we felt like this is the place that we needed to protest and let people know 'no more, we are tired of this.' ”The protest site in Stafford wasn't far, some protesters noted, from where they saw local supporters of the Confederate flag stage a demonstration last year. That demonstration came as a response to calls across the nation to take down public Confederate symbols following the mass shooting that claimed the lives of nine black parishioners in Charleston, S.C.Many of the protesters Wednesday grew up in Stafford, and said the Confederate flag was a common sight throughout their childhoods. The group took a small Confederate flag, wrote "Black Lives Matter” on its face, then discarded it on the sidewalk.Like the Fredericksburg protesters, the Stafford group included African–American and white people as well as older men, women and children."I really thought my generation was going to end this,” said Renee West, who is 58 and white. West pumped up a sign in the air in Stafford as her daughter, her son-in-law, who is black, and one of her grandchildren also marched with signs on the corner.West said she is afraid for her son-in-law and grandchildren when they leave the house in ways that she never was for herself. It was time, she said, to do more than raise awareness in front of a computer screen.During both demonstrations Wednesday, some drivers honked, prompting the protesters to cheer and raise their fists in a show of solidarity.Other drivers and onlookers shouted racial slurs. Some shouted "All lives matter.”The protesters said they agreed that all lives matter. Then they held up a sign that read, "All lives matter but not all are suppressed.”Several passerbys also shouted to the protesters, "get a job.”Wankenge, who works at The Crossings in Fredericksburg, said she found the latter comment telling. Many of the protesters said they were high school and college students with part- or full-time jobs."Because we are black and are protesting, they assume we don't have jobs?” Wankenge said. "Most of us took off work to come here today.”Jonathan Corey and his fiancee, Erin Gobie, sat at Hyperion with their young son as the protesters began to gather late Wednesday afternoon in Fredericksburg.Corey, a Fredericksburg native and white man, said he felt the Black LivesMatter movement implied that only black lives mattered. "I think the media is paying more attention to it because they are a minority,” Gobie said.The couple felt figures in a recent Washington Post analysis were not true. That analysis concluded that black Americans are 2.5 times as likely as white Americans to be shot and killed by police officers, though they are no more likely to be posing an imminent lethal threat the moment they are killed than white Americans fatally shot by police.It also found that unarmed black Americans were five times as likely as unarmed white Americans to be shot and killed by a police officer.But another onlooker, who declined to give his name because he said he was a police officer, agreed with the Post's findings. The African-American man walked with his three children and wife down Caroline Street as protesters passed. He said he's witnessed law enforcement use greater force on people of color than white people, partially due to a lack of understanding of different cultures."They [protesters] are raising awareness about a fear that has always existed,” he said.Protesters had different views of the police forces in the two localities where demonstrations were held Wednesday. The police presence in Stafford was less friendly than in Fredericksburg, several protesters said. Fredericksburg officers talked with the protesters and brought water for them on the steamy-hot afternoon last week.In Stafford on Wednesday, several deputy cars were parked at nearby corners. About 30 minutes into the protest, no deputies had talked to the group, Wankenge said. Organizers were willing to attend a meeting that the Sheriff's Office requested prior to the protest, Wankenge said, but schedules couldn't be worked out.Lt. Lee Peters with the Stafford Sheriff's Office and another deputy approached the group after a white man began shouting outside of a truck window and exchanged words with some of the protesters. Before driving off, the man shouted, using expletives, that the group didn't know what they were talking about, among other things.Peters told protesters that police didn't mind them being there and that they had every right to continue their activities. After asking them what the man said, he told them to stay out of the roadway for their safety and asked them not to beckon their detractors.Wankenge later refuted Peters' characterization that the protesters had beckoned the man.An armored personnel vehicle was parked on the other side of the courthouse. Peters said the Sheriff's Office commonly moves assets around, and the vehicle wasn't necessarily at the courthouse because of the protest."I feel protected but I also feel guarded,” Amanda Waggoner said of the deputies, echoing the sentiments of other black protesters who said they must act more polite with law enforcement out of fear of provoking them.Later that day, when the demonstration moved to the city, at least five Fredericksburg police officers stood on the streets near the protesters.Deputy Sheila Jones, an African-American city police officer, was one of several who introduced herself to protesters. She later watched as they chanted across the street from Hyperion.She said she didn't think there were bad relations between the community and the police in the city. The problems across the nation like what happened in Dallas affect her, but they haven't happened here, she said. Five Dallas police officers were killed at the end of a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest on July 7."I think the world is changing. I just hope people stop and think,” she said.The city police officer of 33 years had experienced racism before, she said. Not three decades before, she said, the Ku Klux Klan demonstrated on the same corner where the protesters chanted Wednesday. But she hadn't experienced any racism recently, she said.Sgt. William Reyes, who stood next to Jones, noted that the group of protesters was small compared to the entire Fredericksburg population.Still, for Bush, protests of 20 or 30 people make a difference."Fredericksburg is a smaller community, so our voices may be heard more. We're not trying to convince people like that. We can't,” Bush said as a passing motorist shouted "all lives matter” at the protesters.He wasn't even sure if he could raise awareness for those familiar faces who drove by and ducked their faces beneath their steering wheels.But he still had hope."We are trying to convince the people that are silent, who are on the fences,” Bush said.
