He was shot 14 times at Red Arrow Park by former Milwaukee police officer Christopher Manney. On Monday, December 8th, Hamilton supporters gathered -- taking their message to the Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm's front door. About two dozen demonstrators went door-to-door in Chisholm's Bay View neighborhood, handing out fact sheets about the Dontre Hamilton case. But they were clearly targeting one person in their demonstration Monday night. "He has failed to charge Christopher Manney. We feel that failure, or that silence is justice denied," Curtis Sails said. "We're just tired of waiting," Hamilton's brother, Nate Hamilton said. In an effort to get answers, a bus load of protesters unloaded in Chisholm's Bay View neighborhood -- walking up the street to his home. A row of Milwaukee police officers stood in front of Chisholm's home as protesters demonstrated.

Dontre Hamilton supporters say they want to see criminal charges filed against Manney. "It was excessive force. It was deadly force. It was unwarranted because Dontre Hamilton was exercising his rights to be in Red Arrow Park," Sails said. Symbolic of Hamilton's final moments at the park, protesters on Monday night got down onto the cold, wet pavement -- staging a "die in," as Dontre Hamilton's mother counted to 14 -- the number of shots Manney fired at Dontre Hamilton. "It's not to intimidate him or scare him. It's to provide him with a community that says we've had enough," Nate Hamilton said. Demonstrators plan to gather again on Tuesday, December 9th in Red Arrow Park. That rally is set to begin at 4:00 p.m. CLICK HERE for further coverage of the Dontre Hamilton case via FOX6Now.com.
