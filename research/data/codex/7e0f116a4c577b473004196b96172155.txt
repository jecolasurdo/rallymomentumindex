His only snaps this season were three handoffs at the end of the season opener. (Josie Lepe/Bay Area News Group) By Cam Inman | cinman@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News GroupPUBLISHED: October 6, 2016 at 10:32 p.m. | UPDATED: October 6, 2016 at 10:48 p.m.var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push(['embed']); While Blaine Gabbert endured a season-high seven sacks Thursday night, twice-retired offensive lineman Anthony Davis weighed in on Twitter and said it's time Colin Kaepernick play quarterback. Davis even conducted a Twitter poll on the subject, and nearly two-thirds of the initial 4,500-plus responders agreed with him. When one follower told Davis this loss was his fault because he quit twice on the 49ers — he retired in June 2011, and again on Sept. 26 — he said he was not to blame and the solution was: "They need Kap.” Davis deleted Tweets in which he advised general manager Trent Baalke to call him, as well as a sample "QB resume” listing him an emergency option in high school with one pass in college. Center Daniel Kilgore, meanwhile, insisted that he and his fellow linemen must protect better. "Whoever it is, we've got to do our job.” — Carlos Hyde ran for his career-best sixth touchdown and tried to maintain a positive outlook amid the four-game skid. "We've just got to stay focused, keep working and not give up,” Hyde said. "Things can turn around. It's a long season.” Hyde had 22 carries for 78 yards, but he drew a taunting penalty for flexing his biceps after a run. Coach Chip Kelly cited that as one of two critical penalties the 49ers committed. "I let my emotions get the best of me,” Hyde admitted. "I've got to stay focused.” For the first time in his three-year career, he's produced a touchdown run in three straight games, with this 1-yard run pulling the 49ers within 21-14 with 1:54 left in the third quarter. It capped an 11-play, 82-yard drive. Hyde also had a career-high six catches for 36 yards. — As NaVorro Bowman officially went on season-ending injured reserve , the 49ers star linebacker vowed "a major comeback” next season. "I want to say thank you to all the fans, my teammates and peers that have sent me get-well wishes and a speedy recovery,” Bowman tweeted. "I know God will protect me and guide me thru these times. "It's just a minor setback for a major comeback. #Trust #MON5T3R” Bowman, of course, produced a major comeback last season from a devastating injury to his left knee and led the league in tackles. — Aaron Lynch, after serving a four-game suspension for violating the league's substance-abuse policy, started in his season debut and had only two tackles on an injury-depleted defense. Beside Bowman, the 49ers also missed three other potential defensive starters: defensive tackles DeForest Buckner (left foot) and Glenn Dorsey (knee), and cornerback Jimmie Ward (left quadriceps). Also out for the 49ers were tight end Vance McDonald (hip), offensive tackle John Theus, wide receiver Keshawn Martin and quarterback Christian Ponder. Dorsey and McDonald were questionable, as was wide receiver Jeremy Kerley. — Starting for the first time this season on the 49ers defense, beside Lynch, was Arik Armstead at right defensive tackle (in place of Buckner) and inside linebacker Nick Bellore (in place of Bowman). Although he had a few missed tackles, Bellore did make nine defensive tackles, two special-teams stops and he shared a sack with Michael Wilhoite. Armstead had three tackles. — Wide receiver Torrey Smith had only one pass come his way, a 35-yard shot that arrived high and off his hands. He had only a 3-yard catch Sunday. "Part of it's who we're going against,” coach Chip Kelly said. "We do have to get him involved more.” — Defensive back and kick returner Chris Davis left the game with a third-quarter injury to his right knee. He got hurt on a 20-yard kickoff return proceding a 49ers touchdown drive. Davis fumbled on his previous kickoff return, setting up a Cardinals go-ahead touchdown. — Wide receiver Jeremy Kerley matched his career high with eight receptions (102 yards). His 9-yard touchdown catch staked the 49res to a 7-0 lead, and it was the first time in his career he's produced a touchdown in consecutive games. — Others who got hurt were 49ers outside linebacker Tank Carradine (toe) and and Cardinals guard Mike Iupati, a former 49er, who left in the third quarter with an ankle injury. — Darryl Pollard, a cornerback on the 49ers' 1988 and '89 champoinship teams, served as the game's honorary captain. — No new 49ers joined the national-anthem protest this game. Kneeling again were Colin Kaepernick, Eric Reid and Eli Harold. Raising their fists were Antoine Bethea, Jaquiski Tartt, Rashard Robinson, Keith Reaser and Mike Davis. No Cardinals protested. — Gabbert badly sailed two throws past open receivers, Garrett Celek and Rod Streater, in the first quarter. Celek was open 20 yards down field, Streater 30 yards. Gabbert later had a 35-yard pass go a bit high and off Torrey Smith's hands at the Cardinals' 40. — The Cardinals punted on seven drives before halftime, and the only exception was their one-play touchdown drive after Campbell's interception at the 21. The 49ers punted on their first four drives and one more before halftime.
