Updated: 5:45 PM PDT Apr 19, 2018 Sarah Heise Senior Digital Editor A few dozen Black Lives Matter protesters took to the streets of downtown Sacramento on Thursday as they delivered 100,000 signed petitions to the Sacramento County District Attorney's Office demanding two officers be charged in the death of Stephon Clark.The petition delivery comes a day after Sacramento County District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert held a news conference detailing the process of legal reviews and the fact that her office doesn't even have Clark's case yet, since the Sacramento Police Department is still wrapping up its own review.Black Lives Matter Sacramento founder Tanya Faison said the march was to let Schubert know people are watching."The signatures are from all over the country," Faison said. "So it's to put pressure on the district attorney so she knows the world is watching and she knows that we are waiting for her to file charges."Schubert said in her Wednesday news conference that any case, including those concerning officer-involved shootings, take time and are part of a process in which her office needs to decide two very important questions based on all the evidence that is presented.In Schubert's words, those two questions are: Has a crime been committed? And if the office believes there has been a crime, can it prove that beyond a reasonable doubt?++Sacramento County DA: Everyone in our society is entitled to due process"The role of a DA's office is not to provide or evaluate an opinion on whether the officers could have taken some other action, whether they made the correct or incorrect tactical decisions, whether there are policies or procedures that the law enforcement agency could change or improve upon," Schubert said. "Our role is very fine and linear: Was there a crime committed and can we prove it beyond a reasonable doubt?"Schubert's office has not begun any type of investigation into the case, but Schubert said once the police department completes its review, her office will be investigating."It's important that the DA or anybody reviewing these case have all the facts," said Ronald Lawrence, vice president of the California Police Chiefs Association. "The investigations take time. They take a lot of time to complete. They are very complex and it's important to have an unbiased review of these cases.""Our district attorney needs the time to take a practical review of this," Lawrence added, who is also the Citrus Heights police chief.However, protesters who delivered the 100,000 signed petitions said they don't want to wait and want charges to be brought now against the officers in Clark's March 18 death."Today, we are here to let District Attorney Anne Marie Schubert know that 100,000 people are behind the side of justice and to ask the question to her, why isn't she?" said Clarise McCants, with Color of Change. "Yesterday, she talked about it can take six months to a year to indict these officers. Her office can get the information that it needs right now and set a precedent -- set a precedent and show that we won't stand for police killing us in cold blood. We don't understand why she isn't doing what the people elected her to do. She is not doing her job. She needs to indict the officers now."++'Gun, gun gun,' Sacramento officer shouts moments before shooting Stephon Clark"I doubt that we will get any kind of justice from the current district attorney," said Rashid Sidqe with the Sacramento Law Enforcement Accountability Directive. "And so, I'm hoping we can put pressure on her to either leave or get voted out.""We cannot allow our community to be gunned down and there be no accountability," he added.Schubert said Wednesday that she understands the community's frustration and anger over what happened and that people want answers."The reality is that what happened to Stephon Clark is a tragedy," Schubert said. "I've watched the videos, they're upsetting. I understand that there is a lot of anger and a lot of frustration, and quite honestly, a lot of confusion about what is happening."Protesters continue to line the district attorney's office several days a week, demanding Schubert bring charges against the officers."We hear it. We hear what's being said. We're not tone deaf to it," Assistant Chief Deputy District Attorney Steve Grippi said. "But ultimately, we're going to follow the law and the facts and make sure that due process is served for everyone.""It's important that people know we're paying attention so that's really the main goal here," he added.When asked if the protesters were unfairly targeting her office, Schubert replied, "I don't think so. I understand there are frustrations and anger. I respect peaceful protests."++Experts review time it took officers to give first aid to Stephon ClarkSchubert also said she felt that what has been happening outside her office of late has not been peaceful. She said her employees, as well as victims and witnesses for cases the office is investigating, are being targeted."If you were to see video footage or just see what's happening behind our building when people are simply trying to leave to go home, whether to pick up their children or get to wherever they need to go and their cars are being surrounded and they're being screamed at, cussed at and blocked, having their license plates filmed," Schubert said.However, Faison called Schubert's comments inaccurate."I think she's mixing up anger with violence, and that's not the same thing," Faison said. "What's violent is how Stephon was murdered in his backyard with his phone."++Sacramento PD releases dozens more videos from Stephon Clark's shooting deathSchubert said she knows there are bigger things at hand that transcend this case and that the community must be willing to have meaningful conversations going forward."Can Sacramento and Sacramento County be a model moving forward?" Schubert said. "In my opinion, the answer is clear: Absolutely. But that must mean that we are willing to move forward together."---KCRA's Mike Luery contributed to this story SACRAMENTO, Calif.
