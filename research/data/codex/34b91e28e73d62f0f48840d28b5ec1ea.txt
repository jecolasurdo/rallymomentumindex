(Anda Chu/Bay Area News Group)Show Caption of ExpandBy Annie Sciacca | asciacca@bayareanewsgroup.com, David DeBolt | ddebolt@bayareanewsgroup.com and Kerry Crowley | kcrowley@bayareanewsgroup.com | Bay Area News GroupPUBLISHED: May 29, 2020 at 7:32 p.m. | UPDATED: June 1, 2020 at 9:39 a.m. Protestors who gathered in downtown Oakland Friday evening to demonstrate following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis this week were met with tear gas and flash bangs and forced to retreat from Broadway shortly before 9:30 p.m. A protest billed as the Minneapolis Solidarity Demonstration began to escalate around 9 p.m. when police officers lined up to block Oakland Police Headquarters from demonstrators began spraying tear gas while protestors set off fireworks and hurled bottles. As protestors began choking from the tear gas, police officers continued to use flash grenades to disperse the crowd. A statement tweeted by the Oakland Police Department at 9:44 p.m. said, "Oakland Police are notifying the crowd at 7 and Broadway the demonstration is now an Unlawful Assembly. Multiple officers were injured when projectiles were thrown. We are requesting people to leave the area.” Just an hour earlier, interim Oakland Police Chief Susan Manheimer appeared in a video on social media telling demonstrators, "If you're out here, let's keep it safe, let's make Oakland strong.” Protestors took to the streets in Oakland, San Jose and across the country Friday to demonstrate following the police killing of Floyd, the deaths of Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery and other instances of racial violence in the United States. Taylor died in March after police entered her Louisville apartment and shot her while Arbery was shot and killed while jogging in Glynn County, Georgia in February. Fire burning in Broadway after violence breaks outs at Oakland demonstration in support of #GeorgeFloyd #breakingnews #protest #oakland @mercnews pic.twitter.com/LLmWe1uTl1 — Anda Chu (@anda_chu) May 30, 2020 As police sprayed tear gas and the crowd began to move away from Oakland Police Headquarters, protestors began covering nearby buildings in graffiti and smashing windows at buildings such as the 24-story Clorox Building and Wells Fargo on Broadway. Chase Bank in downtown Oakland was one of the buildings with boarded up windows, but the boards were ripped off and glass was shattered. Dozens of people began looting a CVS and a Walgreens on Broadway after tearing down a security gate in front of the store. "I feel like everyone is coming out here to seize the moment because this is crazy,” said Zakiya Thomas, 18. "The police have too much power.” Protestors also broke into Target which opened last year at 27th and Broadway and looted the store. After 10 p.m., several small fires broke out in the streets and inside buildings, including one inside Walgreens and another inside the Mercedes-Benz dealership at 29th and Broadway. Plastic barriers and trash were set on fire all throughout downtown. "I feel like they don't listen to us when we're quiet so when we get rowdy they really want to start listening,” said Terri'nae Williams, 18, standing on Broadway after crowds had dispersed and moved around the downtown. Many businesses incurred thousands of dollars of damage, but not all were harmed by protestors on Friday. Hoza Pizzeria at 15th Street between Broadway and Franklin was still serving beer on its outdoor patio at 11:30 p.m. At 10:39 p.m. the Oakland Police Department announced it had increased staffing and requested mutual aid and within the hour, officers from Watsonville and Scott's Valley police had arrived in the downtown area.

"I get it, because I believe too that you really have to make the effort, you have to go the whole way. But we are not the chosen city, we are not the epicenter, we should be peacefully supporting our brothers and sisters in Minneapolis.” Before police sprayed tear gas, an officer with a megaphone at 7th Street and Broadway repeatedly announced the police formed a line to "facilitate the march,” but warned unlawful actions and violence would lead to the declaration of an unlawful assembly. That declaration was ultimately made around 9:30 p.m. The protest started around two-to-three hours earlier on Friday when people began marching from 14th Street up Broadway toward Oakland Police Headquarters chanting "What's his name? George Floyd.” Protesters walked down Broadway at the beginning of the march, chanting "hands up, don't shoot,” as they passed businesses that had boarded up their windows in anticipation of Friday's demonstration. As they approached Oakland Police Headquarters shortly before 8 p.m., some could be heard chanting, "No justice, no police, no racist police” at the officers and Alameda County sheriff's deputies who had lined up in front of the building. By 9 p.m., however, the mass of people had split, amoeba-like, into separate groups, marching in different directions, including toward Chinatown. Here's the scene at 7th and Broadway. #oakland pic.twitter.com/mibSNrXeN2 — Annie Sciacca (@AnnieSciacca) May 30, 2020 The scene was similar to one that played out hours earlier in San Jose. where a protest that began at city hall eventually made its way onto Highway 101, stopping traffic in both directions. Shortly after, the march rapidly devolved into violence, as police officers began shooting tear gas canisters to disperse crowds downtown. Elsewhere around the Bay Area, protestors in cars stopped their vehicles on the upper deck of the western span of the Bay Bridge, causing a significant traffic delay. #Oakland #GeorgeFloydprotest crowd gathering at 14th and Broadway pic.twitter.com/Iyolty2TUJ — David DeBolt (@daviddebolt) May 30, 2020 Additional marches are planned in Oakland this weekend. The Anti-Police Terror Project, which did not organize Friday evening's Oakland protest, is planning on holding a virtual vigil Saturday afternoon and a car caravan for Floyd and Breonna Taylor, an African-American woman shot to death in her apartment by Louisville police officers in March. In a statement released Thursday, Cat Brooks and Rebecca Ruiz of the Anti-Police Terror Project explained why the risks associated with protesting during a pandemic outweighed the threat posed by COVID-19.

It's a conundrum because we want to live but, also, we want to live,” the statement said. On Friday afternoon, California Gov. Gavin Newsom opened an hour-long press briefing with a statement on Floyd's death urging people to be "more resolved now than ever to do more and be better.” "You've got to change culture,” Newsom said. "You've got to change people's hearts and minds. It's not just laws on the books. We've got to change who we are and recognize what we are capable of being.” Report an error Policies and Standards Contact Us Tags: George FloydLootingPolice killingPolice ShootingPolice ShootingsPolice ViolenceProtestsRace & Race Relations Annie Sciacca | Contra Costa County reporter Annie Sciacca joined the Bay Area News Group in 2016 and covers Contra Costa County.
