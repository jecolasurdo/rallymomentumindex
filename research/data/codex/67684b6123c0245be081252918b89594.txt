Taylor | dtaylor@montereyherald.com | Monterey HeraldPUBLISHED: June 9, 2020 at 2:51 p.m. | UPDATED: June 10, 2020 at 3:55 p.m.MONTEREY — Hundreds of protesters filled the lawn in front of Monterey City Hall Tuesday with a unified message: enough is enough. The peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstration filled the lawn area and forced scores of protesters across Pacific Avenue to find places to stand. But describing it as peaceful in no way belies the anger of people who represented an ethnic cross-section of Monterey County — blacks, whites, Asians and Latinos all carried signs decrying police brutality that most recently ended in the killing of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white police officer knelt on his neck for nine minutes.

(David Royal/ Monterey Herald Correspondent) Robert Daniels, a young black man from Seaside, said that without that kind of unity, nothing will change. "We all need to come together,” he said. "We need solidarity and interracial support.” Support was exactly what Christine Riso turned out for. The white Monterey mother wore a T-shirt that read "He can't Breathe,” slightly different from the now ubiquitous phrase "I can't breathe,” which Floyd voiced as he was dying. "As a Caucasian woman I'm here to support the Black Lives Matter movement in the background,” she said, adding that people of color should be the ones everyone needs to listen to, but also whites can no longer stand by silent. "If our neighbors are oppressed, it affects us all,” she said. None of the protesters the Herald spoke with singled out the Monterey Police Department, except to question why so much money is going to police instead of social services.

Only four officers on bicycles were visible, although there was an additional police SUV parked about five blocks away on El Dorado Street. The bicycle officers said they had a very clear understanding of their role at the protest. "We're here to help facilitate people to express their First Amendment rights,” one officer said. "We are not the enemy; we're here to help.” One unusual turn at the protest was a series of speakers, all dressed in black, who declined to identify themselves to the protesters and told the press not to bother asking them questions because they would not comment. Hundreds of signs were held by protesters, reading everything from "No Justice, no Peace” to "Skin is Not Reasonable Suspicion.” Many black protesters, while calling for racial unity, also said whites need to understand their privilege before they can understand what blacks face in America. Willette Jones is a black woman who lives in Corral de Tierra. She's a small business owner, a mother of a son and a grandmother of two. She said she fears for her husband and son when they go out. She has taught her son that when he gets pulled over by police, and in all likelihood he will, he needs to be submissive and show absolutely no sign of resistance for his own safety. "This can be a catalyst for change and it's heartwarming to see all these people, but it's also gut wrenching that we are still having to deal with this,” Jones said. "A mother shouldn't have to fear for her son. It's just time for this to stop. "Oppression has been going on for too long.” Sign up for email newsletters Subscribe Follow Us Facebook Twitter Instagram RSS Most Popular Pacific Grove officials scrap plans to close sections of Lighthouse Avenue Monterey-based attorney charged with wire fraud Coronavirus: Here's who has to wear a mask in California and when Pacific Grove police describe use of force with public Daily nonstop Monterey-Seattle Alaska Airlines route moved to early 2021 start date "Amazing:” Dozens of massive blue whales spotted off Northern California coast Coronavirus: Monterey County slowly reopening lakes for camping, boating California districts look to rename schools linked to racist history Tags: George FloydNewsletter Dennis L.
