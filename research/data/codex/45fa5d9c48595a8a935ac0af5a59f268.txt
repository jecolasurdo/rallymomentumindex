The silent protest, which began last week before a game against Pasadena, has put the local 11- and 12-year-olds in the middle of a national debate on race and has subjected them to online criticism, some of which has been threatening. The team, which plays in the senior division of the Bay Area Football League, decided to kneel to protest "the injustice that goes on in our society for minorities," coach Rah-Rah Barber said last week. The players wanted to follow the lead of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, according to Barber. April Parkerson said on Saturday that she feared her son would face repercussions from the Bulls' organization after the group issued a warning late last week that players who protested would be benched or removed from the game. But she said the Bulls' board backed down on the threat at the last minute. "I'm so proud of our boys right now," said Parkerson, who wore a red shirt with a picture of the Bulls kneeling during the game against Pasadena. "But I have been a wreck this week wondering if anything was going to happen to my kid for kneeling." Members of the Bulls' executive board refused to comment Saturday. Some members of the Beaumont Bulls youth football team and coaches kneel while others stand during the playing of the National Anthem prior to their home game Saturday. The team has gotten national attention after choosing to kneel in protest of social injustice at their game last week. After receiving numerous negative comments, including threats of violence aimed at both the 11 - 12-year-old players as well as coaches and parents, questions arose as to whether their protest would continue, and what negative actions may be taken by board members of the Bulls football program. Ultimately, no action was immediately taken against those players who chose to kneel, and the game continued as scheduled.

"It's one word," Velek said of the players' protest. "Disrespectful." A statement from Bay Area Football League President Tony Patino last week stated the protest was "not in violation of any regulation, rules or policies" of the youth organization. The statement went on to say that the league had not been in contact with anyone in the Bulls' organization. Assistant coach Derrick Joseph said the decision to kneel for a second time was up to each individual player. Joseph, who served in the U.S. Marine Corps from 1991 to 1995, stood during the anthem along with two other coaches and five players, who linked arms in a display of solidarity. "Everyone has their own opinions on things," said Joseph. "People grew up and were raised differently. You can't change the way some people think. We have to respect everyone's rights to feel the way they do." Spectators in the crowd displayed varying levels of support and disdain over the protest. A woman in the front row kneeled with her head bowed while lifting a white sign that read, "8 years of service = My kid has no rights." Several of the Alvin fans sang the words to the national anthem passionately as Eric Brooks and five other members of the local African-American community stood with their fists raised in the air, holding up the Pan-African Flag. Although none of the men were related to the players, Brooks said his group came to the game to support the Bulls' message. "It is their freedom of choice, by living in this country, to take a stand," Brooks said. "They're making a stand for what they see in the community and what they believe should be changed. We believe in that stand and we believe people died to allow these freedoms. I don't understand why there is such an uproar when kids decide to exercise their rights." Vietnam veteran Jim Flex, a supporter from Alvin, called the protest "disgusting." "They've already got bad examples in their lives and this is just making it worse," Flex said. The divisiveness of the protest is something Parkerson said she expected when her son took a knee last week. The negative online comments, including death threats and remarks about lynching the players and coaches, did not surprise her. It was her son and his teammates who came up with the idea to kneel after the deaths of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling stirred concerns about their own safety, she said. "Unfortunately, hate and ignorance are very powerful things," Parkerson said. "What surprised me most actually was the amount of support we received." Parkerson said she expects her son to kneel during the anthem for the rest of the season, including the next two weeks when the Bulls play on the road. "We've been noticed, we've been seen," Parkerson said. "Now we want to take it a step further and help bridge the gap here in the community to make a positive change. We can't just leave it where it is."
