This time Megan Rapinoe is not alone. Several players from both teams joined her, staying in the locker room during the flag and anthem ceremony. Elli Reed, Megan Rapinoe, Madalyn Schiffel, Lauren Barnes and Diana Matheson from the Reign did not take the field. Former Sounders/Reign player Sydney Leroux was among the FCKC starters who were not out for the ceremonies. Yael Averbuch, Becky Sauerbrunn, and Desiree Scott round out that group. Sauerbrunn is currently the United States captain. Leroux and Rapinoe are both regulars with the USWNT. A few missing starters on the field for the national anthem. Rapinoe, Leroux, Scott, Averbuch & Sauerbrunn. pic.twitter.com/LnBCBHFMpZ— Ride of theValkyries (@rovalks) September 25, 2017 Related U.S. Soccer banned Rapinoe's protest without caring to understand it NFL players responded to Donald Trump with more protests than ever Seahawks will protest during national anthem en masse, stay in locker room LA Sparks stay in locker room for national anthem before WNBA Finals Game 1 Last season, Megan Rapinoe was alone among Seattle Reign FC and U.S. Women's National Team players in kneeling during the anthem. This sparked a team owner to move the anthem rather than watch 'Pinoe kneel, and led to a USSF policy that requires any player that has or will represent United States to stand while the anthem is played during any event which the Federation is represented. Rapinoe has not knelt this season. It is not yet known how refusing to be present for the anthem will be accepted in light of USSF's rule. The players did not issue a statement before the match.
