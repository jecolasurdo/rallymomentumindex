Updated: 7:03 PM PST Feb 27, 2016 Sharokina Shams KCRA 3 Reporter Protesters gathered in Sacramento's Oak Park Saturday to speak out against a meeting of property owners, arguing that the revitalization of the area is forcing long-time residents and business owners out.Landlords, house-flippers and investors met just after noon inside The Guild Theater on 35th Street.Outside, about 30 Oak Park residents and members of "Black Lives Matter" held signs and used a bullhorn to shout their message.Tanya Faison, who organized the protest, said the property owners should leave."People will come from the Bay Area, buy these properties, fix them up, sell them for more money and what ends up happening is people can't afford to live here that originally lived here," Faison said.The complaint is not new to Sacramento.Over the last two years, some business owners and residents in downtown Sacramento have complained that the new Kings' arena has resulted in rising rents, in particular for commercial properties. Also, new uses for old buildings have often meant that leases don't get renewed.In Oak Park, critics of redevelopment said elderly business owners haven't been able to work fast enough to keep up with recent code enforcement efforts and don't get the tax breaks that developers do."When it came to them receiving redevelopment assistance, it just wasn't on the table for them at all," Oak Park resident Anita Earl said.Earl said she has counted seven longtime businesses, including a barber shop and nail salon, close their doors.Terre Johnson, executive director of the Oak Park Business Association, said revitalization has been good. Residents no longer have to drive to downtown to enjoy restaurants or book stores, he said."I think that everybody's benefiting, the job development, just the people in the neighborhood are all benefiting as well," Johnson said.The meeting of property owners was led by Al Williamson, a landlord who also writes about ways to beautify properties. He said he agrees with some of what the protesters have to say."I'm exactly what they want,” Williamson said. "I provide, on my own, affordable housing on a private sense. You know, rent's around $700 for a one-bedroom. I keep it $625 and $650." SACRAMENTO, Calif.
