Kaepernick remains a free agent, but several NFL players have continued to protest during the national anthem this season, including during the preseason.More protests: Preseason | Week 1Here are the players who protested in Week 2 (most recent updates first):Green Bay Packers: Tight end Martellus Bennett stood at the far end of the Packers' bench with his right fist in the air during the anthem before Sunday night's game against the Falcons, as he did in the previous game against the Seahawks. Bennett said last week that he wasn't sure whether he would make any kind of protest during the national anthem after news of his brother Michael's incident with police became public. When asked whether he would do anything during the anthem, he said: "I like to speak through my art, my words and things like that. I wouldn't be surprised if I draw another political cartoon or some s---, but other than that, I don't know right now. I'm more of a spur-of-the-moment-type guy, type of thing." -- Rob DemovskySeattle Seahawks: Defensive lineman Michael Bennett continued to sit for the national anthem, this time before the team's home opener against the 49ers. Center Justin Britt and running back Thomas Rawls again stood on either side of Bennett, each with a supportive hand on Bennett's shoulder. Cliff Avril also again joined Bennett in taking a seat on the bench for the tail end of the anthem, as did fellow defensive end Frank Clark. -- Brady HendersonLos Angeles Rams: Robert Quinn was not alone in his anthem protest Sunday. The Rams outside linebacker raised his right fist in the air before the game against Washington, as usual, and was embraced by punter Johnny Hekker in a sign of solidarity. Hekker hugged Quinn around the waist, and Quinn had his hand on Hekker's shoulder. "I think that just shows the message we're trying to send is unity,” Quinn said after the game. "Hopefully we just keep spreading that, and hopefully one day we can make the world realize what we're really about, and that we're all one people.” -- Alden GonzalezSan Francisco 49ers: Safety Eric Reid again knelt for the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Seahawks. About 10 teammates surrounded Reid with a hand on his shoulder as he knelt. Reid was one of the first players to join Kaepernick in his protest last season. -- Nick WagonerOakland Raiders: As has been his custom since the first preseason game, running back Marshawn Lynch resumed his practice of sitting on the bench during the national anthem before the Raiders' game against the Jets. He has not said why he has chosen to sit, though, and the Oakland native received a raucous welcome for his first regular-season game as a Raider in Oakland. -- Paul GutierrezPhiladelphia Eagles: Safety Malcolm Jenkins continued his protest by raising a fist over his head prior to the Eagles' game at the Kansas City Chiefs. He has been demonstrating since Week 2 of last season. Defensive end Chris Long kept his hand on Jenkins' back for the entire playing of "The Star-Spangled Banner," as he did during the preseason in a show of support. Safety Rodney McLeod put a hand on Jenkins' shoulder as well. -- Tim McManusKansas City Chiefs: Cornerback Marcus Peters sat on the bench during the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Eagles. Peters sat on an equipment table behind Kansas City's bench before last week's game against the Patriots in New England, and he raised a fist during the national anthem for the Chiefs' season opener in 2016. -- Adam Teicher FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmail
