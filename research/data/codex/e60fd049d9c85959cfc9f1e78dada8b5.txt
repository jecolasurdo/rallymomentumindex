Matt Bell/Register & Bee Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save "Hate has no business in our heart and our community,” Danville Mayor Sherman Saunders told a crowd of about 30 people who gathered for a noon prayer vigil Thursday at St. Paul African Methodist Episcopal Church on Gay StreetThe Rev. Avon Keen, president of the state Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said the vigil was being held in support of the victims of a shooting rampage at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina, that left nine people dead Wednesday night.Keen thanked members of St. Paul AME and the Interdenominational Ministerial Alliance of Danville & Vicinity for hastily making arrangements to show their support of the Charleston victims. "Danville is proud to stand with anyone going through any tough times,” Saunders said. "Yes, we know God is in charge and He will settle all of this in His due time ... we encourage everyone to turn to each other, not on each other.”Saunders also told the crowd to pray for 21-year-old Dylann Roof, captured Thursday and charged with the nine homicides, which are being treated as hate crimes. After singing "We Shall Overcome,” reading the Psalm 23, praying the Lord's Prayer and having a moment of silence, the group dispersed, with Keen announcing the capture of Roof and reminding them, "God is on our side.” Gunman caught in killing of 9 in historic black church A white man who joined a prayer meeting inside a historic black church and then fatally shot nine people was captured without resistance Thursday after an all-night manhunt, Charleston's police chief said. Keen said after the meeting that groups like the Ku Klux Klan and white supremacists continue to foster hate. "We keep talking about all of these hate groups and no one is listening,” Keen said. "We need to have dialogues about it.”Keen said many of those groups are strong and organized, using the early Tuesday morning distribution of racist flyers in at least two Danville neighborhoods as an example."You put that stuff out and someone mentally unstable gets hold of it, there's no telling what they'd do,” Keen said.Instead of ignoring such hate literature distributions, they should be reported heavily so residents know those groups are in the city, Keen said. Keen said churches in particular need to be more vigilant, especially for more casual meetings, like prayer groups and Bible study, where there are generally not ushers greeting people as they arrive. "This could happen anywhere,” Keen said. "There is going to be a whole lot of fear; people will be afraid to go to church.”Thibodeau reports for the Danville Register & Bee. 0 comments Tags Avon Keen Danville Prayer Vigil Saunders Christianity Worship Politics Sherman Victim Emanuel Ame Church Related to this story Most Popular Local 'She was just a beautiful person'; authorities have yet to ID people involved in homicide Jun 12, 2020 A woman is dead and the suspected shooter wounded by police after a Thursday incident in Pittsylvania County.
