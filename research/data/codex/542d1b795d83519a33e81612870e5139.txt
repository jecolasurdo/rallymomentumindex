During their lunch hour, the group divided on the east and west sides of Duff Avenue near Mary Greeley Medical Center and McFarland Clinic. They knelt for eight minutes in silence. "Those of us in health care were pretty appalled. We want to protect lives,” said Dr. Linda Lehman of McFarland Clinic. "Seeing an airway crushed is devastating and probably unfortunately a sign of a lot bigger problem.” Dr. Lehman said that the death of young men prematurely is a medical issue as well. "We see way too much prejudice that has been brought to the forefront more recently because of 24-hour news cycle,” said Kristy Calland of McFarland Clinic. "I think us being much more aware of it is a great thing.” Rodah Lunanunvelele, of Mary Greeley Medical Center, has worked in medical records for 20 years in Ames. She came to the United States from her native Kenya. She said she appreciated the support from her coworkers. "I was moved to tears. I have two boys and to see everybody coming to fight the injustice that goes on in this country, not on everybody but with a few people, it's priceless,” said Lunanunvelele. "So I had to come out and support and be part of this mission to fight injustice.” With two boys at home, she understands what they will face. "The 14-year-old boy, I have to tell him, you have to rise above everything,” said Lunanunvelele, "If a policeman stops you, do everything they say. Let's fight it in court, let's obey everything because I don't want you to be dead.” Close Modal Suggest a Correction Your name(required) Your email(required) Report a typo or grammatical error(required) Submit Suggest a Correction Share this story More News Stories New Iowa Law Protects Businesses From COVID-19 Lawsuits by Maria Lisignoli / Jun 19, 2020 DES MOINES, Iowa -- Gov. Kim Reynolds has signed a bill into law that now gives businesses and health care providers more protections against COVID-19-related lawsuits. Republicans in the legislature supported the bill, saying it will help reopen Iowa's economy. "Things like businesses, churches, schools, pools and also to health care workers, as well as people who completely change their business model to manufacturer things like PPE and make masks and hand sanitizer and stuff. It's a way to make sure that those people can be protected and the businesses get their doors back open without the threat of litigation hanging over their head,” Republican State Sen. Zach Whiting said.
