More than a dozen stores in Lower Manhattan were also looted.Through much of the afternoon until well after dark, crowds of protesters holding signs and chanting slogans made their way through Harlem, the East Village, Times Square, Columbus Circle, Jackson Heights in Queens, the Flatbush section of Brooklyn and portions of the Bronx and Staten Island, sometimes seeming to move independently but at other moments appearing to break apart, come together and re-splinter in a way that tested the ability of the police to maintain control.Many of the actions were peaceful, with demonstrators waving burning sage at the police or shouting Mr. Floyd's name to mourn his death last Monday at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer. "I'm not here to fight someone,” said Eldon Gillet, 40, who was on the streets in Brooklyn. "I'm here to fight a system.”VideoIn a third day of demonstrations, protesters blocked traffic and marched from Brooklyn into Manhattan.CreditCredit...Chang W. Lee/The New York TimesBut the protests became violent at intervals as people overturned trash cans, smashed store windows, set fire to police cars, and hurled bottles and other debris at crowds of officers.By nightfall, there were already dozens of arrests, including at least seven outside Trump Tower where several protesters refused official orders to move out of Fifth Avenue and on to the sidewalks. "No sidewalks!” the protesters there called out. "This is a protest. We belong in the streets.”A few blocks to the south, graffiti was scrawled on the exterior walls of St. Patrick's Cathedral.One of the tensest moments of the day — captured on a video that quickly went viral — came on Flatbush Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where police officers in an S.U.V. were blocked by a throng of protesters carrying a yellow metal barricade.As other demonstrators pelted the vehicle, and a second police S.U.V., with objects from the street, the cars suddenly surged forward into the crowd. It was not immediately clear if anyone was injured, and a police spokesman said Saturday night that the department had no comment on the video.VideoA video shows New York City police cars pushing into a crowd of protesters in Brooklyn on Saturday. Mayor Bill de Blasio said he wished the officers had not done that but also said the protesters were to blame.Mayor Bill de Blasio, at a news conference Saturday night, said he was not going to blame officers "who were trying to deal with an absolutely impossible situation.”"The folks who were converging on that police car did the wrong thing to begin with and they created an untenable situation,” the mayor said. "I wish the officers found a different approach, but let's begin at the beginning. The protesters in that video did the wrong thing to surround that police car, period.”The New York protests were part of a growing wave of demonstrations, marches and clashes with police from coast to coast, with the National Guard deployed in several states and curfews imposed in cities including Minneapolis, Chicago, Los Angeles and Atlanta. But Mr. de Blasio said he would not issue a curfew, citing the effectiveness of the police department and what he characterized as a small number of protesters for a city of 8 million people.For most of the evening, Brooklyn was the center of the violence. On Bedford Avenue in Flatbush around 5:30 p.m., a large group of demonstrators confronted the police in a series of push-and-pull street melees. Officers responded with billy clubs and pepper spray. A police helicopter flew low above the crowd, buffeting people with gusts of wind.After a 30-minute standoff, the two sides seemed to reach a truce and some protesters lit marijuana joints in front of officers who held their batons at their sides.But at about 6:40 p.m., a shoving match erupted between the police and a young man on a bicycle. Several officers charged the crowd, batons swinging. The police dragged one man away.ImageA police officer pepper spraying protesters in Brooklyn.Credit...Chang W.

Lee/The New York TimesThe widespread skirmishes came one day after violent protests erupted outside Barclays Center in Brooklyn, where some in the crowd had hurled bottles and firebombs at the police. More than 200 arrests were made on Friday.As the city woke on Saturday morning to images of police officers violently shoving protesters and police vehicles burning in the street, Mr. de Blasio denounced the previous night's events, issuing an urgent plea for calm while saying he understood the deep anger over racism and police killings that had spurred the demonstrations.The mayor promised that any police officers who had used unnecessary force during the clashes would be held accountable, and he announced an independent inquiry to be led by the state attorney general's office into how the police had handled Friday night's protests.ImageA protester's eyes are washed with bottled water after he was hit with pepper spray.Credit...Chang W.

Lee/The New York Times"Any aggressive act toward a peaceful protester sends exactly the wrong message,” Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference, referring to videos that appeared to show violent acts by the police. "We will not accept that kind of behavior. It is unacceptable.”But Mr. de Blasio and the police commissioner, Dermot F. Shea, said that hundreds of demonstrators had come to the rallies on Friday night with the intent to brawl with the police. A firearm was recovered from one protester, and a set of brass knuckles from another. Some protesters came with bricks and threw them at officers, Mr. Shea said. A Molotov cocktail was thrown at an occupied police van at around 1 a.m., Mr. Shea said.Samantha Shader, 27, of the Catskills region, was arrested in connection with the tossing of the Molotov cocktail and was expected to face federal charges, law enforcement officials said on Saturday. While the firebomb Ms. Shader threw shattered a rear window of the van, the officers inside managed to jump out.Even as the protests got underway on Saturday, Mr. Shea said he feared it would "be a long night.”"Everyone is upset,” he acknowledged, adding, "But when you look at how we go forward, I think we can all agree, the rational minds, that going forward is going to come from discussions, from protests, from activism, but not from more violence.”ImageKelly Munoz, 25, after being hit by a baton in Brooklyn.Credit...Chang W.

Some in the crowd urged African-American officers to join them.Pushing south through the square, the police made several arrests, charging into the throng and grabbing those who were not fast enough to escape."This is an unlawful assembly,” one officer called through a megaphone. "You must disperse or you will be subject to arrest.”ImageA standoff on 14th Street in Manhattan.Credit...Gabriela Bhaskar for The New York TimesImageA protester on the roof of a gas station in Brooklyn.Credit...Stephanie Keith for The New York TimesIn Union Square, a separate stream of protesters moved through the streets yelling, applauding and weaving among the cars. They were greeted by enthusiastic onlookers. Old women banged pots out of the windows of a public-housing project. Other people met the demonstrators with snacks, water bottles and dollops of hand sanitizer."So many nationalities are coming together for the sake of unity,” said Marquelle Turner-Gilchrist, a 33-year-old black man. "It's quite moving.”Ainara Gonzalez, a 35-year-old woman from Spain, was one of many white protesters with signs testifying to their solidarity with Black Lives Matter. Hers read, "White Silence Is White Violence.”"These killings are a sign of white supremacy and they are enabled by white people staying silent,” Ms. Gonzalez said. "I feel a responsibility coming here because I am white.”As the sun prepared to set, the mood near Union Square started growing darker.At Fifth Avenue near 15th Street, the police abruptly formed a circle. Tear gas canisters began to fly as officers hollered at the crowd to retreat and pushed protesters back on to the sidewalk.Only blocks away, at 14th Street and Fourth Avenue, a group of protesters smashed the windows of a police S.U.V., then hopped atop it as officers charged and surrounded them.ImageFirefighters put out a burning police car on Church Avenue in Brooklyn.Credit...Stephanie Keith for The New York TimesImageThe light from a helicopter shining down on a protester in Brooklyn.Credit...Chang W. Lee/The New York TimesAs the night wore on, many businesses in Brooklyn and Manhattan were vandalized, among them a Chop't salad restaurant, a Whole Foods near Atlantic Terminal and an Adidas store in Soho, where people looted track suits and sweatpants. Protesters riding bicycles on Broadway near New York University threw bricks at shops, smashing the windows of a Bank of America branch and other storefronts. One demonstrator criticized the destruction, saying, "We didn't come here to do that!”Shortly after 10 p.m., President Trump — who implied a few days ago that looters in Minneapolis could be shot, earning a warning label from Twitter — took again to Twitter in support of the New York police."Let New York's Finest be New York's Finest,” Mr. Trump wrote. "There is nobody better, but they must be allowed to do their job!”A couple of hours earlier on Bedford Avenue in Brooklyn, with smoke rising from a burning police car nearby, Capt. Gaby Celiba, the commanding officer of the 61st Precinct, pleaded with protesters, "Don't throw things!”Standing beside him was Mr. Gillett, the 40-year-old Brooklyn man, who echoed the message and warned that officers would hit back "because they don't care about you.”Captain Celiba and Mr. Gillett then conferred for a few more minutes, in a rare encounter this week between police and marchers that looked more cooperative than antagonistic.When Captain Celiba walked away, Mr. Gillett said that he had two young children at home and did not want to see them, or any of his neighbors, hurt."I'm out here,” he said, "so they won't have to be out here.”Sean Piccoli, Aaron Randle, William K.
