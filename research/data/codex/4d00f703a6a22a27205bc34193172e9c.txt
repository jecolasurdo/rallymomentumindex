Print A crowd of close to 100 protesters, police and the mayor took a knee together Thursday at a park in Chula Vista as part of a peaceful demonstration to call for police reform and racial justice.Chula Vista Mayor Mary Casillas Salas and police knelt with protesters at Chula Vista Community Park for a moment of silence for George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody last week in Minnesota after an officer knelt on his neck for several minutes.The peaceful demonstration was one of many that have taken place throughout San Diego County and the nation since Floyd's death.Salas said she came to the demonstration, her first since the protests and civil unrest began in San Diego County a week ago, to support the people in Chula Vista who are calling for justice and equality. Advertisement "I think it's very important as a community leader to say that we stand behind the protesters, we understand the pain of the African American community and that this kind of stuff should not be tolerated,” she said, "and that we have to make systemic changes not only within our nation and our cities, but within ourselves.”Protesters held homemade signs with messages including, "Do not go gentle into that goodnight. Rage rage rage,” and the words, "Say their names” surrounded by photographs of black people killed by police. They chanted "No justice, no peace” as passing vehicles honked in approval, some with passengers cheering their support from open windows.Bianca Holloway, 18, of Eastlake said she joined the demonstration to demand change on behalf of those who can't."Just. like, seeing different lives being taken for no reason and seeing how families are getting away from their fathers and their sons and their brothers just because the color of their skin is not right,” Holloway said. "We must speak up because they don't have the opportunity to do that anymore.” Advertisement Chula Vista resident Earnest Hayden, 52, said as he knelt on the grass Thursday, that as a black man, he has had some scary experiences being stopped by police for infractions as small as having one of the tires of a car he was driving touch the white line dividing lanes. He said he worries constantly about his 22-year-old son, who lives out of state, being similarly detained.Hayden said his father was a police officer and so, while he respects police in general and appreciates their service, he thinks the public would be safer if law enforcement agencies did more to routinely screen for problematic officers.Hayden said perhaps law enforcement agencies could review the performance of every police officer who has, say, five complaints on their records, then require extra training or discipline them if an officer's performance is found deficient. He noted that the officer who pressed his knee against Floyd's neck had 18 prior complaints against him.Helena Holloway, another Eastlake resident at the protest, suggested law enforcement agencies require officers to record themselves on body cameras or other video stating the reason for stopping someone before making the stop. Advertisement Chula Vista Police Agent Bryan Jackson said Floyd's death and the video of the officer kneeling on Floyd's neck, was upsetting to many police officers, too. He said he and other police were at the event Thursday to listen to people's concerns, answer their questions and generally make them feel safe — not intimidated — as they demonstrated.
