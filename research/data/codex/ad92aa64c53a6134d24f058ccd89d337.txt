Allison Lee Isley/Journal Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save About 20 demonstrators protested Monday about the recent deaths of two inmates at the Forsyth County Jail, saying that county officials must be held responsible for the circumstances that demonstrators believe contributed to the deaths.The protesters gathered briefly at Merschel Plaza on West Fourth Street, holding signs and chanting. They moved under a parking deck off West Third Street when it started raining.The rally ended after they marched to the jail. The demonstrators chanted slogans such as, "No justice, no peace,” "It's our duty to fight for our freedom, and "Money and jobs for education, not for for mass incarceration.”Stephen Antwan Patterson, 40, died in the jail on May 26.A detention officer entered Patterson's cell and determined that he wasn't breathing and had no pulse.Efforts to revive Patterson were unsuccessful.A relative has said Patterson had a history of high blood pressure and expressed concern about the medical care that he received at the jail.On May 2, Deshawn Lamont Coley, 39, also died inside the jail. Coley died after he suffered a medical condition, the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office said. Coley's widow said that Coley told her that the jail medical staff wasn't properly treating his asthma before his death.Coley wanted to go to a hospital, but the jail staff treated him inside the jail, the family said.The State Bureau of Investigation and the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office are in the midst of investigating both deaths.Sheriff Bill Schatzman said in an interview last week that the two deaths appeared to be "an unfortunate natural occurrence” and that he had seen nothing so far to make him think that the men's cases had been mishandled.Before the rally, Effrianguan Muhammad, Winston-Salem's representative to Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, said he has spoken to Patterson's mother about her son's death."No mother should have to bury their child,” Muhammad said.Muhammad and Tony Ndege, an organizer with Black Lives Matter Winston-Salem, told the demonstrators that Forsyth County officials, including the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office, must be held accountable."We are all human beings, and we deserve to be treated humanely,” Ndege said. jhinton@wsjournal.com 336-727-7299 @jhintonWSJ Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save +11 Galleries Rally for the Deaths of Two Jail Inmates Jun 5, 2017 0 Tags Politics Jail Social Services Police Demonstrator Medicine Bill Schatzman Deshawn Lamont Coley Forsyth County Stephen Antwan Patterson Inmate John Hinton Follow John Hinton Recommended for you Load comments × Post a comment as Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.
