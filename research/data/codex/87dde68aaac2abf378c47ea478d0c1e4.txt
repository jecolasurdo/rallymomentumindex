The group's leader, sporting a megaphone, began a call-and-response chant. "We've got unity,” the protesters chanted to a crowd of several hundred. "No more immunity for killing our community.” That evening, on the anniversary of the death of Sandra Bland, more than 1,000 people participated in a Black Lives Matter protest sponsored by the Mass Action Against Police Brutality. The crowd marched through Roxbury and the South End, rallying residents who saw the protest outside their windows. Though some believed that marching through other neighborhoods could have better supported the cause, protesting was important, according to Brandeis University African American and Afro American studies senior Nyah Macklin. "This walk is to get the Boston Police Department (BPD) to understand [police brutality] is not a joke and cannot be taken lightly,” she said. Those at the march called for a new idea to create justice in a system that hasn't been working for all populations and to convict police officers who use deadly force. BPD issued a statement saying that officers from several different divisions will begin wearing body cameras on a volunteer basis, on Tuesday, July 12. The department hopes to have these in place by the end of August and, if the six month trial runs smoothly, to outfit all officers with body cameras. Approximately nineteen percent of the city's $2.97 billion budget will go to public safety for the 2017 Fiscal Year, according to the city's website. Some of that funding will go towards the new body cameras. Costs other than the cameras themselves, including film storage and extra staff to review the footage, will put the total expense of this project in the millions. "I think the cameras are irrelevant if you can turn them off and if the system doesn't change,” said Macklin. "We've had video before and what has that done?” Others believe that issuing the body cameras is a step in the right direction, but not enough to create justice in the system. "The cameras will allow us to see the problem more clearly, but they won't create justice,” said Northeastern senior political science major Jaisun Lewinski. "Until we change this from a social, cultural and educational standpoint, we are going to keep creating people who are ignorant to this problem.” Some protesters implored reform in law enforcement, noting technical difficulties that can occur with body cameras. "Sometimes, the cameras aren't focused or on. I would like to see police trained in a way other than deadly force,” said Peggy Barrett, 65. "Currently, [most police forces] cut back on training—deadly force only. I'd rather invest in better training.” The protest isn't to offend law enforcement officials, but rather urge change and equal justice, said Lewinski. "A lot of police departments take it personally as an affront on individuals, but that's not what Black Lives Matter is about,” he said. "Instead of having policies that show [injustice] we need consequences.” Photos by Sam Haas, news staff Get our weekly newsletter: Enter your email address powered by TinyLetter Featured ContentNortheastern shares additional NUflex details on cleaning, visas, sports in Tuesday town hall June 17, 2020Northeastern announces 'NUflex' hybrid learning model for fall June 5, 2020Activist groups form coalition to advocate for safe reopening June 2, 2020View All Navigate LeftCityLocal cannabis dispensary reaps benefits of economic empowerment opportunitiesCityBoston plans to renovate City Hall Plaza, increase accessibilityCityBernie supporters rally, march from State HouseCityMarkey, Kennedy mostly in step at first Senate primary debateCityThe political power of Boston's Latinx communityCityCoronavirus poses minimal threat in Boston despite local caseCityWork and Family Mobility Act approved by Transportation CommitteeCityOne Year of Aging Strong: Boston's Initiative to Empower the ElderlyCityAnti-vaxxers protest bills for required immunizationCityBoston shapes new narrative with King Boston memorial, advocacyNavigate RightThe Huntington News Instagram Twitter Facebook The independent student newspaper of Northeastern UniversityGeneral inquiries: The Huntington News Northeastern University, 102 Lake Hall 360 Huntington Avenue Boston, MA 02115 Email: [email protected] Voicemail: 617-506-3970Who We Are Our Mission Staff Directory Board of Directors Connect Submit Your Work Open Positions Weekly Newsletter Support Advertise © 2020 The Huntington News.
