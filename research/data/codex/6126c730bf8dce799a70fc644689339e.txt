Don't think this stuff only happens overseas — Khale McHurst (@Khalemchurst) July 15, 2016 The recent spate of police shootings have sparked outrage across the US. A number of high profile artists have publicly taken a stand against the killings and are working to build a campaign pressuring lawmakers to action action. The Australian rallies have been organised to express solidarity with the victims in the US, as well as advocate on behalf of "Aboriginal Australians who've been killed and prosecuted by law enforcement too”, according to the Sydney rally's Facebook page. Writing in New Matilda, Indigenous writer Amy McQuire compared the reaction the Australian public had to police shootings in the US to that of recent Indigenous deaths in custody. "Sometimes it's easy for Australians to look overseas, and believe that the outrages that gave rise to movements like Black Lives Matter are foreign. But for Aboriginal Australia, this is a common story. The problem is, of course, that it is less visible,” McQuire said. This disconnect is something the rally organisers seem to be trying to reconcile with their strong emphasis on expressing solidarity with both the black community in the US and the Indigenous community in Australia.
