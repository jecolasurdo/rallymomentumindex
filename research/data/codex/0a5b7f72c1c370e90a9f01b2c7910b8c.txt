The protest, loud but peaceful and short, started in the ground-floor corridor of city hall as city council met. Vanessa Dorimain, on the executive of the Student Federation of the University of Ottawa, which organized the protest, said they wanted the city's support for the Black Lives Matter movement in Toronto. Protesters had jars and cans for donations for the demonstrators camped out at Toronto police headquarters. "I have an issue with the city not addressing and supporting this,” Dorimain said as protestors' chants echoed through the building. "We have people here in the city who have experienced police brutality, they experience carding from the police and that has never been mentioned from the city, from the mayor, from the councillors, nothing like that. This is a real issue here in Ottawa, too, and this needs to be addressed. These people are not here out of vain. This is not here to be a show. This is real life for a lot of us.” City hall security tried to convince the protestors to leave. Instead, they sat on the floor. Several Ottawa police officers showed up to assess the protest, but it was Somerset Coun. Catherine McKenney who defused it, talking about the Black Lives Matter mural on Somerset Street that was defaced last year. "We've had this type of incident happen in our community and the residents in my community, in my ward, reacted to this very strongly,” McKenney said. "Black lives do matter to us. We recognize that safety is an issue for everyone but not everyone is treated equally and we have to recognize that.” The protesters left the building shortly later. Community Safety Minister Yasir Naqvi announced this week the province is banning police from randomly collecting information from people through street checks, or "carding.” Still, Dorimain said she isn't convinced carding will stop in Ottawa. twitter.com/JonathanWilling Comments Share your thoughts Ottawa Weather 30°C A few clouds Feels like 35°C Saturday 32°C Sunday 32°C Monday 29°C Tuesday 29°C More Weather Related Posts PLAYING THROUGH: ClubEG booming with social and competitive golf in Ottawa Cracks of Don: Chilling, graphic hazing allegations from Carcillo.
