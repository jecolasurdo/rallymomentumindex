Community activist Quanell X and former Houston City Councilwoman Jolanda Jones said the drawing made light of a serious matter, was disrespectful and highlighted cultural insensitivity. RELATED: Bland case spotlights the state's urgent need to upgrade law enforcement training The cartoon showed a Texas police officer pulling over Bland's funeral hearse for an illegal lane change and informing the driver her body would be returned to jail. Bland, 28, died in her Waller County jail cell on July 13, three days after a state trooper pulled her over for failing to signal a lane change. She was arrested on a charge of assaulting an officer. "To use a cartoon with a hearse with her name on the back window on the day of her funeral is poor timing," Quanell X said. He said he and others had put out calls on social media for followers to complain to the Chronicle, which has received hundreds of phone calls and emails about the cartoon since Sunday. Jones said the Chronicle poorly understands the African-American perspective.

In a statement, the Chronicle editorial board said the cartoon was meant as satire. "In publishing it, we certainly did not intend to make light of her death. In fact, in an editorial published Thursday, we also expressed our outrage about the circumstances surrounding the traffic stop," the board said. "The op-ed pages are a space for an exchange of views. Sometimes those views are provocative, as with this cartoon. We're sorry that it offended some readers."
