He and three other officers who were involved in Floyd's arrest have been fired, and Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said Friday that the investigation into those three officers is ongoing. Many of the Boston protesters took a knee. Some held signs supporting the Black Lives Matter movement, reading "I Can't Breathe,” and decrying police violence.

Charlie Baker said earlier Friday in his daily press conference. The event was organized by Mass Action Against Police Brutality.
