AP Images By Yolanda Sangweni · August 10, 2014 Hundreds of residents in Ferguson, St. Louis gathered on the streets last night to protest the fatal shooting of Michael "Mike, Mike” Brown, who was shot by a police officer. Brown was unarmed. The 18-year-old recently graduated from high school and was preparing to start classes at Vatterott College on Monday, reports the St. Louis Post Dispatch. Brown's mother, Lesley McSpadden, said the shooting occurred as her son walked to his grandmother's house. A witness said she saw an officer trying to place Brown into a squad car. The teen then attempted to flee, at which point the officer shot him as he ran. "He (the officer) shot again and once my friend felt that shot, he turned around and put his hands in the air,” said Brown's friend, Dorian Johnson, who said he was with the slain teen when the shooting occurred. "He started to get down and the officer still approached with his weapon drawn and fired several more shots.” The shooting ignited protests in the predominantly Black suburb outside of St. Louis as residents confronted officers, reportedly shouting, "Kill the police.” Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, could be seen holding a sign that read: "Ferguson police just executed my unarmed son!!!” "We are hurt to hear that yet another teenaged boy has been slaughtered by law enforcement especially in light of the recent death of Eric Garner in New York who was killed for selling cigarettes,” St. Louis County NAACP President Esther Haywood said in a statement. "We plan to do everything within our power to ensure that the Ferguson Police Department as well as the St. Louis County Police Department releases all details pertinent to the shooting.” The Ferguson Police Department has yet to release the officer's name, but Chief Tom Jackson said he has been put on paid administrative leave.
