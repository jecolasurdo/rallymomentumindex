Published on May 3, 2019loudlabs.comTORRANCE - The Torrance Police Department was called out to the Torrance Mayor's house due to a protest on the front lawn of his home. Police showed up and told the protesters that they cannot stand on his property but that they could stand on the sidewalk in front of his home. The protest has to do with a fatal officer involved shooting that took place in the city on Dec 9th, 2018. The police bodycam footage was released last week. The mother of the suspect/victim spoke to us on camera about the situation and why they are at the mayor's home.
