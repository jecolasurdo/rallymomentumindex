The activists from Black Lives Matter Minneapolis and Catholic Workers staged demonstrations around the stadium — one blocking traffic on N. 7th Street and Glenwood Avenue and another on the light rail tracks near the Target Field Station. There were about 30 activists participating in each demonstration. The gathering on N. 7th Street ended when demonstrators left less than 15 minutes after it began. On the light rail tracks, the activists linked arms and chanted. Some carried signs that said "White silence kills” and "Justice 4 Jamar.” About 3 p.m. Metro Transit tweeted, "Due to blocked tracks, Blue and Green are unable to serve Target Field Station. Trains continue to serve other stations.” Transit police issued three requests that the demonstrators leave the tracks. When they did not move, police began arresting demonstrators shortly after 3:30 p.m. Twenty-five people were arrested.
