Protest in York loosely formed, disjointed and angry, but it gave many a chance to ventRandy Parker, York Daily Record Published 10:36 p.m. ET June 1, 2020 | Updated 10:48 a.m. ET June 2, 2020CLOSE At least a couple hundred protesters walked from Penn Park to the Judicial Center in York on Monday night. York Daily RecordA rally that was expected to be at Penn Park took over the steps of the courthouse, the police station and the square in York.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREYork got a taste on Monday of what a Black Lives Matter rally on Tuesday might bring. Up to about 200 people gathered in Penn Park around 6 p.m. for a loosely organized protest against police brutality in York and across the nation. City and police leaders, who were at the rally, had expected it to remain at the park in the heart of the city. But after about a dozen speakers expressed anger and frustration about the treatment of black people generally, the crowd marched a couple blocks north to the police station.They filled the steps at the entrance of the white-pillared building and again people took turns expressing their grievances about the police. Here, they tended to be more specific about their encounters with York City Police. George Floyd protests: Pennsylvania emerges from weekend of demonstrations, more expectedThrough thick and thin: Best friends organize Black Lives Matter peaceful protest in YorkOne woman spoke about years of mistreatment her family had suffered at the hands of one officer in particular. Another woman shouted out the name of a longtime member of the department. "Where's he at?" she shouted to no one in particular. "He's the main a---hole!"York City Police Commissioner Osborne "Moe” Robinson III, who joined the department earlier this year, spoke about growing up as a black kid in Baltimore. He spoke about how before he was a black police officer, he was a black man."And I am still a black man," he shouted, struggling to capture the crowd's attention. As with most speakers, the crowd was noisy, disruptive, with some people jeering the speakers and others shouting them down.Buy PhotoApproximately 200 people marched, chanted, spoke and carried signs from Penn Park to the Judicial Center in York in a protest on Monday, June 1, 2020. (Photo: Shelly Stallsmith, York Daily Record)But Robinson took control as he said he did not need to watch replay after replay of the arrest of George Floyd in Minnesota. He said he knew right away that this was a crime based on their own policies and procedures. And he said police and prosecutors all need to take action against such police officers. "It's not just about the individual. It's about the institution," he shouted from the steps of the department he now heads. And to change that institution, he said, you need to join the institution. He said police departments across the nation struggle to recruit minority officers, and he implored those before him on West King to join. But that suggestion was met with open derision by many men in the crowd.

With no police escort and permits, the group walked through traffic and brought it to a halt at the square.For nine minutes – the same amount of time that video shows Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin with his knee on Floyd's neck – the crowd blocked traffic in all directions. Some drivers waited patiently, others were clearly irritated. A block to the north, according to witnesses who declined to be named, a woman got out of her car to yell at the protesters. The woman was beaten and her car was smashed. The rear window was shattered, and the hood and trunk were badly caved in. Police made no arrests but did interview the woman. No report has been released. Check back for updates as they become available. After nine minutes, the crowd proceeded to the steps of the York County Judicial Center. Although Sheriff Richard Keuerleber, who oversees security for the building, had decreed that protesters were not allowed on the steps, no deputies came outside. However, Keuerleber could be seen inside with several deputies, some of whom wore riot gear.

Around 8 p.m., the group largely dispersed. A core group remained at the courthouse. And another group of about 50 had again gathered back at the starting point in Penn Park. On Tuesday, a Black Lives Matter rally organized by other people is scheduled to start at 5 p.m. at Continental Square. City leaders expect this to be bigger. Organizers have stressed that they intend it to be peaceful. Philip Given, chief of staff to Mayor Michael Helfrich, said the city plans to focus on listening to the concerns of these protesters more than trying to control what they do."It's a privilege to give a platform for those voices to be heard," he said Monday night. On Tuesday, people can expect to hear from the mayor and the commissioner again, he said, but their main purpose for being there is to listen.
