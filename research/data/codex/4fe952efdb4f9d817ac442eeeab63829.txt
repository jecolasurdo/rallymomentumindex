Photograph: John Minchillo/AP The widow of Eric Garner, who died after a New York police department officer put him in a chokehold, stood before a crowd of supporters on Saturday morning, dressed in a T-shirt that carried the words: "This stops today." Speaking at a rally hosted by the Reverend Al Sharpton's National Action Network at the House of Justice in Harlem, Manhattan, Esaw Garner made her first public statement's since her husband's funeral. Garner condemned the actions of NYPD officers involved in the incident and called for justice for her husband, whom she described as peaceful. "He was a quiet man, but he's making a lot of noise now," Garner said, to fervent applause and shouts from the crowd. Eric Garner died in Staten Island on 17 July, after officers who wanted to take him into custody for allegedly selling loose, untaxed cigarettes wrestled him to the ground and put him in a chokehold. Medical examiners have not yet determined the cause of Garner's death, but officials said he went into cardiac arrest on the way to the hospital. Garner's mother, Gwen Carr, spoke publicly for the first time since her son's death on Saturday. She said she would not wish the experience on her worst enemy. "All the people out in the United States, all the people out there I thank you from the bottom of my heart for standing with me and my family,” she said. Sharpton said a march across the city's Verrazano-Narrows bridge was being planned in honour of Garner and other victims of police brutality. The bridge connects Staten Island with Brooklyn. "We cannot have a precedent that you can use an illegal chokehold, someone died and you cannot just walkaway from that," Sharpton said. Sharpton added that he, Garner's family and attorneys have been meeting federal attorneys and local officials in an effort to punish the police officers involved in the incident. The NYPD took the gun and badge from Daniel Pantaleo, the officer who put his arm around Garner's neck. At least one other officer involved in the incident has been placed on desk duty. "As long as they [the police] think they can get away with anything no matter what, they're going to keep doing it," Sharpton said. "You have to show them they are there to protect the law, not that they are above the law." New York's police commissioner, Bill Bratton, said on Tuesday the NYPD had banned officers from using the chokehold more than two decades ago and that the department would retrain its entire 35,000-person force regarding chokeholds. "This case – I want to be really clear, Commissioner – is not about training," Sharpton said. "You do not need training to stop choking someone who says they can't breathe."Other speakers at the rally included Nicole Paultre Bell, the fiancee of Sean Bell, who the NYPD fatally shot the morning before his wedding in 2006, and Jahmiel Cuffee and his family. A video released this week shows Cuffee being wrestled to the ground by police in an incident prompted by a marijuana possession charge. The arresting officer allegedly stomped on Cuffee's head and threatened him with a gun. "Why are they so angry? Why are they so angry at a community of those they are supposed to protect?" Cuffee's sister said on Saturday, through tears. On Saturday, the NYPD confirmed that an officer had been placed on restricted duty regarding that incident. Patrick Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen's Association, released a statement which said: "Videotapes never present all of the facts in a situation. They never capture the criminal act or offense that brings police action to the scene. They present an isolated period of a police interaction but never the entire scenario."

Photograph: AP Such recent incidents involving NYPD officers have raised questions about the controversial "Broken Windows” theory, which asserts that aggressive policing on minor offences leads to greater public safety. The approach to policing is supported by Bratton and the New York mayor, Bill de Blasio; as head of the New York transit police in the 1990s, Bratton was an early pioneer. "The mayor and the commissioner should acknowledge the heavy price paid for heavy enforcement,” the New York Times editorial board wrote on Saturday. "Broken windows and its variants – 'zero-tolerance', 'quality-of-life', 'stop-and-frisk' practices – have pointlessly burdened thousands of young people, most of them black and Hispanic, with criminal records.” "These policies have filled courts to bursting with first-time, minor offenders whose cases are often thrown out, though not before their lives are severely disrupted and their reputations blemished."
