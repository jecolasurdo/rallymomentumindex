Here are highlights from Monday, when protests continued.

Police tried to block the protesters from entering, and some activists found the Bellevue doors locked. "I want to know why these doors are locked. ... I want to know whose city this is!" one protester said upon trying to get in.

"Given the information disclosed it seems clear that the responding officers, in this case, did not violate the current policies which guide their work and acted in accordance with the law," the statement said. "As for the Starbucks employees, while it will ultimately be up to the company to decide whether their employees acted within the spirit of their organizational policies, they certainly broke no laws either. "Further, it seems that the men who were ultimately arrested in this incident may not have been legally justified to be in Starbucks once they refused to make a purchase and did not leave when asked by both the store management and police." Starbucks issues correction about manager's departure The manager who called police to the Starbucks at 18th and Spruce Streets on Thursday has left the store "while there is an internal review pending," a company spokeswoman said. The spokeswoman said she had erred earlier Monday by describing the separation as "mutual." Anti-Defamation League calls for Starbucks employees to undergo mandatory implicit bias training Nancy K. Baron-Baer, ADL Philadelphia's regional director, also called for police to undergo training. "Systemic racial discrimination and structural biases in our country are real and have devastating outcomes," Baron-Baer said in a statement. "Nobody should have to fear using a place of public accommodation because of the color of their skin." Manager at 18th and Spruce Starbucks leaves the company The manager of the Center City Starbucks where two black men were arrested last week has left the company in what a Starbucks spokeswoman called a "mutual" decision. Activists had demanded the firing of the manager, who called police on the men Thursday as they were waiting to meet a white acquaintance in the coffee shop at 18th and Spruce Streets. Two hours in, still roughly 40 protesters here at Starbucks.

More protests planned Monday afternoon A sit-in at the coffee shop was planned for 4 p.m. Monday. On Monday morning, Council member Helen Gym and about 40 others chanted and protested at the Starbucks. On Sunday, dozens of protesters also occupied the store for a brief time.

In an interview with the Inquirer and Daily News, he called the arrests "reprehensible." "There are situations where it's appropriate to call the police, situations where there are threats or disruptions in our store," Johnson said. "This situation had none of that, and these two gentlemen did not deserve what unfolded." Johnson said that the company's guidelines on when and whether to call the police are "ambiguous" and that he wants to clarify the guidelines and have all store managers do training on unconscious bias. Starbucks shares open lower The coffee company's shares moved down slightly Monday. As most stocks rose, news of the arrests spread and public-relations experts critiqued the company's response. People are calling out other alleged incidents of racism at Starbucks Abdul-Aliy Muhammad, co-founder of the Black and Brown Workers Cooperative and one of the activists involved in the Philadelphia protests, recalled being told to leave a Philadelphia Starbucks while checking emails in 2017. The store manager, Muhammad wrote, said seats were for paying customers only. "I'm pretty sure that if I had on different attire or had been white, this wouldn't have happened the way it did," Muhammad wrote. READ:re: StarbucksThis is an email from Abdul-Aliy from this past December. Starbucks in Philadelphia has a history... Posted by Black & Brown Workers Cooperative on Sunday, April 15, 2018 On Twitter, a video from a Starbucks in Los Angeles also showed a store manager telling a man to leave. The man said in the video he had not been allowed to use the restroom before making a purchase, even though a white man had. Here we go again. Meet Brandon Ward. He was @Starbucks - about to make a purchase - and needed to use the restroom.They denied him the code. He then finds a white man, Weston, who came out of the restroom.He had not made a purchase but they gave HIM the code. RACISM. pic.twitter.com/2UGZ20aOtF— Shaun King (@shaunking) April 16, 2018 A woman recalled a similar experience in Philadelphia. My partner and I saw the same thing happen at a Philly Starbucks at 4th + South on Easter. After the black man left they gave a white woman the code without requiring a purchase. My partner tried to point it out and they ignored it...— Marian Gibfried (@MarianGibfried) April 16, 2018 >>READ MORE: Need to catch up on the Starbucks arrests?
