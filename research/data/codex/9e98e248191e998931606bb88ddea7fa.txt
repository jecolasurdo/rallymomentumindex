Gottfried | mgottfried@pioneerpress.com and Jaime DeLage | jdelage@pioneerpress.com | Pioneer PressPUBLISHED: July 25, 2016 at 5:53 p.m. | UPDATED: July 27, 2016 at 6:25 p.m.Highlights Protesters have been outside the Governor's Residence almost nonstop since early morning hours of July 7. They are seeking charges against officer in July 6 shooting death of black motorist Philando Castile. Case remains under investigation. Though the shooting took place in the suburb of Falcon Heights, most of the protests have been in St. Paul. St. Paul costs responding to protests and marches - one of which they say turned into a riot - have topped $1 million.

(Pioneer Press: Scott Takushi)Show Caption of Expand St. Paul police arrested about 70 people Tuesday and early Wednesday near the Governor's Residence on Summit Avenue in a day and night marked by tense standoffs and groups of protesters being driven to jail in buses. The location has been the focal point of protests for 20 days, beginning just after a St. Anthony police officer fatally shot Philando Castile in Falcon Heights the night of July 6. Police shut down Summit Avenue in front of the residence for about a week and a half and then reopened it, but protesters closed it down again Sunday night. The street and sidewalks outside the mansion, from Milton Street to Lexington Parkway, remained closed Wednesday morning. The arrests began Tuesday morning, after police made an attempt to reopen the avenue. Mayor Chris Coleman said it started out peacefully but some protesters became uncooperative. "Some folks became defiant, a few folks became quite frankly dangerous,‚Äù Coleman said. "...It became very clear that for some of those folks endangering folks was exactly what they wanted to do, including throwing things at passing cars when we tried to open up the street again.‚Äù Water bottles and cigarettes were thrown, according to police. But Nekima Levy-Pounds, Minneapolis NAACP president, said police officers had "used military force unnecessarily against non violent peaceful demonstrators.‚Äù "We have to stand our ground as a people and continue to rise up and fight against oppression,‚Äù Levy-Pounds said. "... They want us to go about our daily lives, they want us to forget about Philando Castile, but the reality is that that man did not deserve to die.‚Äù INITIALLY NO ARRESTS Police arrived at the encampment shortly after 7 a.m. Tuesday and told about 40 protesters ‚Äî many of whom were sleeping in the street and the sidewalk ‚Äî they would have to stop blocking traffic and leave the area so it could be cleared of debris.

Then at 10:45 a.m., a group of officers rushed across the street to the front of the Governor's Residence and soon forcibly arrested five people. It happened because a protester threw a temporary "No parking‚Äù sign, which had been posted on the side of the road, into the street, said Steve Linders, St. Paul police spokesman. Demonstrators linked arms as they saw a large number of officers approaching, Avent said. "We linked up in solidarity to tell them that we're not going to let them arrest him,‚Äù Avent said. "At that point, (the officers) physically became abusive.‚Äù One of the people arrested has cerebral palsy, Avent said. Police officers "had his arms winched so far behind his back,‚Äù Avent said. "The whole time he's letting them know he's handicapped, that they should not be him arresting him like that, that he will go peacefully.‚Äù LIVE on #Periscope https://t.co/wS2RRSnB8f ‚Äî Mara Gottfried (@MaraGottfried) July 26, 2016 Many people captured the tense moments on video. Officers had to carry out the arrests as they did because, Linders said, as "officers attempted to arrest the individual who threw city property into the street, other people tried to protect that person from being arrested.‚Äù ARRESTS CONTINUE Police officers retreated and reopened Summit Avenue at 11 a.m. Tuesday. But by 11:30 a.m., police closed Summit Avenue again between Chatsworth and Oxford streets and a group of officers headed toward the Governor's Residence. Police have about 20 people sitting on the sidewalk. Handful of people standing in the street. pic.twitter.com/aAnW7NKBzn ‚Äî Mara Gottfried (@MaraGottfried) July 26, 2016 A police commander announced, "This is an unlawful assembly, you are under arrest‚Äù and told people to sit down. Officers arrested 17 people without incident. Then, as a crowd gathered at Summit and Oxford, police officers formed a line to keep them from going toward the Governor's Residence. Chanting, "If Philando don't get it, shut it down." pic.twitter.com/ZJja2G0wWC ‚Äî Mara Gottfried (@MaraGottfried) July 26, 2016 At about 1 p.m., there was a small group on the other side of the line of officers at the intersection. Another line of officers holding batons in front of them and walking in formation chanted, "Move back,‚Äù and sprayed a burst of chemical irritant. A 16-year-old in the group was sprayed in the face. Meanwhile, outside the Governor's Residence, Minnesota State Patrol troopers were removing the large number of signs which demonstrators had hung along the fence. The State Patrol is responsible for security at the Governor's Residence and a St. Paul police spokesman said they made any decisions about the signs. The troopers were assisting St. Paul police in the cleanup of the encampment, according to a Minnesota Department of Public Safety spokesman. At 2:10 p.m., the line of St. Paul police officers blocking Summit at Oxford retreated, and protesters again headed to the Governor's Residence and gathered in front. They quickly hung a "Black Lives Matter‚Äù sign on the front gate and then one that said, "Unite for Philando.‚Äù Police opened Summit Avenue at 2:30 p.m., but quickly closed it again. SUMMIT OPENED, CLOSED AGAIN Police arrested or cited people for charges ranging from obstructing legal process to disorderly conduct to unlawful assembly to public nuisance. Arrests are "a last resort for us,‚Äù said St. Paul Police Chief Todd Axtell. He and Coleman said the city is committed to balancing people's First Amendment rights to peacefully protest with ensuring public safety. This is the message @mayorcoleman sent to neighbors of Governor's Residence on Monday. pic.twitter.com/gI6uANHAVP ‚Äî Mara Gottfried (@MaraGottfried) July 27, 2016 Protesters stayed outside the Governor's Residence and police reopened Summit Avenue about 5:55 p.m., but closed it about 6:30 p.m., when they began making arrests again. Officers arrested 19 people for public nuisance and unlawful assembly, with Linders saying people had continued to block the sidewalk. While it appeared that most protesters were trying to comply with police orders to clear the street and sidewalk, Linders said there were reports of protesters throwing things at vehicles when the street was open. There also have been complaints of property damage and graffiti, he said. Summit Avenue remained closed as of 8 a.m. Wednesday. "We intend to keep it closed until it is safe to reopen,‚Äù Linders said. The city has now posted this on Summit near Oxford. pic.twitter.com/uzhl0Uotgt ‚Äî Mara Gottfried (@MaraGottfried) July 26, 2016 A.J. Simmons was among the many protesters who had left by the time the evening arrests started, but he was back at the corner of Oxford and Summit later along with a growing and determined group facing the officers blocking the street. Simmons, of St. Paul, said he hasn't had any problems with police himself but he knows enough people who have that he's starting to feel unsafe. "Just because it doesn't happen to me I'm not going to sit around and let other people get bullied,‚Äù Simmons said. As night fell the number of protesters swelled to more than 100, forming a line facing the police and deputies blocking access to the Governor's Residence. Protesters danced and chanted at Oxford and Summit, interfering with traffic until police blocked access to the intersection from surrounding streets. Several times over the hours police announced that the protesters were participating in an unlawful assembly and they were subject to arrest. Each time the group reacted with a renewed round of chants. Finally, about 2 a.m. Wednesday, an officer announced, "You are all under arrest‚Äù and the line of police pushed the protesters out of the intersection. Those who remained in the intersection were restrained with zipties and loaded onto a bus to Ramsey County jail. A St. Paul police spokesman said 23 were arrested and cited for public nuisance and unlawful assembly. Summit Avenue remained closed after 3 a.m. with just a handful of protesters remaining on the perimeter of the area. Here's one more look at police and #GovMansion protesters across the way before I head out. Quiet here now. pic.twitter.com/RIgyoSRejW ‚Äî Mara Gottfried (@MaraGottfried) July 27, 2016 After the demonstration began on July 7 outside the Governor's Residence, Gov. Mark Dayton said he would not ask those protesting in front of the mansion to leave and that he supported their ability to express their rights in accordance with the law. Dayton did not request Tuesday's police action; it was the decision of the St. Paul police department, said spokesman Sam Fettig. As of midmorning Wednesday, Summit was closed to car traffic from Milton Street to Lexington Parkway, and closed even to pedestrians in the block of the governor's mansion. Law enforcement vehicles and officers from a variety of agencies, including the state patrol, blockaded the street on either end. Scholarship in Castile's honor The St. Paul Central Foundation will create a scholarship in Philando Castile's honor. A fundraiser is planned for Aug. 21 at the Dunning lots at Griggs Street and Marshall Avenue.

Another one that probably still has no license, or insurance, and probably does have a gun under his shirt. Big Twins Fan Hence, the real reason why he's leading the protest ‚Äì he feels victimized by the police. Here's the thing about being stopped by the police ‚Äì don't do anything, don't have to worry about being pulled over. And, if you're pulled over for something you didn't do, shut up, be respectful and fight it in court. The police are doing their jobs in enforcing the law (well, except for SPPD at the Governor's Mansion, of course). They don't decide your guilt or innocence. Alumni69 You are extremely na√Øve. And racist. WeekendThinker We're all racist. We hate criminals and their bad behavior. That makes us racists. Wow. Fool, give it a rest. These idiots aren't even interested in some dead man. They only care about freebies and more freebies. No work, all play by these creeps makes the rest of us racist.........because we work and pay taxes. Oh my. Are you a racist too? I suspect so. If not, they're meeting at the mansion. Better get there quick. Mac David Nice straw man argument, racist. demsrborgs Another Jay eagle. ..looking for freebies HM It's funny how every time someone makes a comment the BLM supporters don't like it becomes a racist comment. How about not supporting a group that thinks they can go around and disrupt hard working people who do contribute to society. drhill BLM=KKK ‚Äì just different skin preferences... all clowns. Whodunnit I saw someone once call them "klan with a tan‚Äù I felt guilty for laughing drhill ... that's not bad. I saw 2 BLMer's on a talk show... the host was black and talking about how Beyonce was an embarrassment during the Super Bowl ‚Äì she was pro Black Panther , pro Malcom X, and pro BLM... the host asked the 2 BLMers what they would do if KKK ran a half time show ‚Äì since it is the same hateful spirit... he made a great point, and was very anti BLM... they said if he (the host) was hung on a cross they would be ok with it. satmfs And are creations of the Democrats/Liberals. drhill ... BLM are not interested in truth ‚Äì it is all about the race card and division. WeekendThinker I believe that with all my heart. blm isn't even interested in the white people that are supporting their cause. Talk about racists...darn. GreaterMN And you are all alone here. Fun, huh? GreaterMN You are no longer alone. You have "Ms. Jones‚Äù in your camp. That's about it. FlyingFarang I've read his comment over 3 times and still find nothing relating to racism. I guess that makes you the racist. Big Twins Fan Thank you, FF! I am not naive in the least and I'm certainly not racist. That's the battle cry these days, I suppose. Someone doesn't like your opinion and you're a racist. Please tell me where one word that I've written is racist. I've been pulled over because a part on my car was broken. I've also been questioned because I looked like someone else. Do I cry about it? No. I fixed my car and told the truth. I'm tired of people deeming that, becasue they don't support an opinion, the person giving that opinion is racist. It's like crying wolf... demsrborgs Hey Jay eagle. What's free today all heart Oh well, so are you. Whodunnit He'll claim he was racially targeted. How come he can't just go out and get his drink on, drive home drunk and hopefully not kill a car full of people without the police hounding him!! It's because he's black you know drhill ... exactly ^ this is a perfect BLM role model... maybe he'll get in a criminal vehicular tussle and end up dead ‚Äì then BLM can scream about racial profiling! gladitsnight They are doing what their chief tells them to do. Highlander Mr. Avent certainly gets around.

James Dawson My my ‚Äì What a busy fellow! I guess one can't drink AND obey driving laws. drhill ... the crazy thing is all of his legal woes are because of RACISM! James Dawson Indeed. DWI laws should not apply to Blacks. drhill hahahaha Antileftist yeah, the white man poured that malt liquor down his throat. Hal Henderson Oh, so he's just a drunk. Here is was thinking maybe he was a real dedicated activist. Instead he's just a drunk. Whodunnit Just a drunk behind the wheel at least 3 times. He should be doing straight up jail time after 3 DWI's. WeekendThinker And this time make it stick. No more keeping the rest of the neighborhood hostage to people that have nothing better to do.......like work for a living. EastSider Clear them out, and they just come back. Much like cockroaches, you have to kill them all, or they just repopulate. Clear the whole lot of them out of there and be done with it. SouthernGuy Grab the fire hose and chase 'em out that way. Judging from the looks of these disheveled characters, you'd be doing both the community AND them a favor. Might want to hand out a few bars of soap beforehand... Askov Smith Can we start billing George Soros for all the police over time? Or maybe Rashad Turner. Oh..wait...he's unemployed. How about the NAACP? Or the governor's office. It's not cheap.... Gagmewaspoon I heard the cost of this little exercise in tolerance has reached over $1 million of St. Paul taxpayer money. Whodunnit The funds should be taken from Governor Goofys racial diversity fund Alumni69 Yes, because God knows our governor was directly responsible for Castile's death. Whodunnit He allocated over over 100M to reverse racial disparities, so yes it can be taken out of the fund to be used in the community. Should taxpayers fund the additional manpower needed to having to continually be at the Governors mansion, cleaning up their mess, diverting traffic, and then opening the street back up? If the Soro funded BLM group want to stay out there...let them pay for it Hal Henderson He asked for 100 mil, the legislature gave him 35 mil. Read the article. Whodunnit Fine...have it your way. 1M down to cover for cleanup and police overtime....34M to go. GreaterMN Was he? Shoulda known. Thanks for the update. demsrborgs HI Jay eagle, out for your freebie posts all heart No, people like you are. Goofy is in a drug induced fog. http://www.whatsunderthebed.com dean Nobody, absolutely nobody was responsible for Philando Castile's death other than Castile himself and the Rashad Turner-led entitlement mentality so prevalent in today's society. Anyone who thinks that the law excludes themselves due to their skin color (or lack thereof) is eventually going to run into a bullet from a police officer, be it a white male cop, or a female; red, black or pink with blue cameras. Mac David About one tenth what Falcon Heights taxpayers will fork out for their out of control police force. Fred I drove by the Governor's Mansion Sunday. I saw a lot of State Patrol cars and officers. There's more than just St. Paul taxpayer money involved. say_WHAT??? Interesting insight about Mr. Turner. He's the one that cancelled the protest at Rosedale Mall, knowing that he and his BLM group would be quickly associated with the murders of the cops earlier that morning in KC. He's become a politician instead of a revolutionary. St. Paul City Council must pay better than leading a non-profit. Mr. Turner appears to have already sold out. Just like Bernie Sanders...Democrats with Pr√≠nciples are a dying breed. The Crusader As I said before, if there was any justice in Minnesota the money would be coming from the DFL's war chest. http://www.whatsunderthebed.com dean I can assure you Rashad Turner is being paid. The DNC funds BLM. Antileftist Actually George Soros funds blm. Of course he's a major benefactor of the DNC as well. Soros was a Nazi collaborator who sold out his fellow Jews so save his own hide. Funny how you don't see the main stream media do any expos√©s on him. say_WHAT??? If I lived on that street and had to pay the property taxes those people have to pay...I'd be livid a bunch of people are shutting down my street. The Governor has already gone on record calling the cops racist and has already come to his conclusion that the cop is guilty of murder. Why protest the Governor? This didn't happen in Saint Paul, it happened in Falcon Heights. Maybe the bus doesn't go up Snelling? It also didn't happen in. Roseville, so stop the stupid protests at the Rosedale Mall. Gagmewaspoon Unless they're arrested, they'll be back. Our new police chief is as big a chump as our milquetoast mayor. WeekendThinker The police chief is under control of the mindless, cowardly mayor. And he ain't gonna do nuffin. He needs votes for his run for governor. MnMom88 This protest has more damage to their cause than anything else. It makes no sense and it has no logical solution. I would suggest that these people channel their time and efforts into something that will have concrete, positive results ‚Äì perhaps getting at the root of the problem: poverty, lack of education, lack of family support and a culture of violence. WeekendThinker This is the easiest thing for them to do, and that is all they are willing to do, and in most cases is all they are capable of doing. Jobs and work are not part of their lives or even their vocabulary. Now you say "free money and food from welfare‚Äù or maybe even from mommy and daddy, they understand that really well. Patricia LOL good one....so true, so true... Ranger1873 Stop being sensible, please. You'll wreck the curve. üôÇ And that $1,000,000 in protest-related costs would have looked mighty good in, say, community programs to curb urban violence. Patski The Governor's mansion looks like ghetto trash. What a disgrace. I feel sorry for the neighbors having to see and put up with this crap 24/7. However, I don't feel sorry for Governor Goofy though. He deserves to put up with the trash. The Crusader 'Some people call you ghetto trash, I call you my base.' ‚Äì The DFL governor channeling George W. Bush WeekendThinker He should have them in his back yard, or maybe his living room. Then they should show up at Coleman's house....his front yard......and block in his limo. 3m_t@3 Looks like plenty of room at Dayton's backyard and parking lot...order was for them not to block the street and sidewalk. Couple trees too, just in case they need a bathroom. Whodunnit More than one photo showed them camped out on one of the neighbors lawn. If it were my home, I would be mowing my lawn to remove them Antileftist Just throw some job applications at them. They'll leave. DavefromMinn Its all just millionaire Democrats living on Summit Ave. So it doesn't bother me. Patski You probably right. However, these yahoos have no right to go and trash a neighborhood. Asyb79 Ha, I live a block away. The blocked road is not really a big deal... I have more issue with the loud news helicopters than anything. all heart You deserve them! Skip67 Why does he deserve them? jayce9 If I lived within a three block radius I would be putting it up for sale. There is a reason you don't want to live near a high profile public figure and this is it. EastSider I wonder how much the taxpayers will be paying for a new lawn after they kill it with their idiotic encampment? Alumni69 They can't get onto the lawn. It's fenced off. Whodunnit They've been on the neighbors lawns. That wouldn't happen if I lived next door Mac David About one millionth what its going to cost Falcon Heights tax payers. EastSider It is kind of fun to watch the hand wringing over there. On one hand, the whole of Summit Ave is rich lefties who love to complain about every other house on the street. On the other, the whole of Summit Ave is rich lefties who are the first to march in these BLM "protests‚Äù to try and show how non-racist they are. mexiapolis I hope you weren't planning a tour. Why are all tours cancelled? Patricia Damn, there goes my weekend plans.... DavefromMinn The James J Hill house is a good tour. Do that instead. Or the Ramsey house. Patricia Thanks! mollena Do you suppose this means that they think the protest will continue throughout the summer? Whodunnit Because they know once they get BLM and their ilk inside the mansion, they'd never leave. JJ What is the over under on them blocking the street again. I say by Wednesday night that street will be blocked again, with Axtell letting them do it. Tucker Chief Axtell is only following orders from Mayor Chris Coleman, Former Chief Tom Smith also faced the same issue, as the mayor doesn't let the police chief do his job. Askov Smith Let's say Chief Axtell ignored Coleman and actually did his job upholding the law what would happen? Coleman would fire him? No way. The backlash would be huge. WeekendThinker I like your idea. Nom de Plume Coleman's sycophants in the dept would undermine the chief making his job impossible. Politicians like mayor squeaky don't know much, but they know politics. Highlander Several things could happen including discipline for failure to follow the Mayor's (Axtell's supervisor) directive. Like it or not Axtell works under the direction and supervision of Chrissy Coleman and Coleman is a political animal who has no backbone. Coleman is living proof the Strong Mayor system under the current City Charter was a serious mistake. Askov Smith Actually, it would be political suicide for Coleman (you call him Chrissy? Kind of odd) to discipline Axtell for disobeying an order to allow BLM to continue to block Summit. To this point, both Governor Goofy and Mayor Coleman have denied the theory that the order to allow BLM to continue breaking laws comes from their offices. For that to get out would hurt Coleman greatly. I read somewhere you were a lifelong Democrat. Aren't these two leaders yours? Did you vote for them? WeekendThinker This is the fault of Chris Coleman and Mark Dayton. Axtell has his hands tied. And as of this moment, it sounds like the street is already closed again. Coleman is a coward. And I don't think he even owns a pair of big boy pants. Whodunnit I wondering if Axtell is already regretting accepting his new position WeekendThinker Wouldn't surprise me. But since he was Coleman's "choice‚Äù, maybe he's just kicking back and following orders. That shouldn't be too hard to do. Don't you think?..........lol WeekendThinker "Officers took several of the shouting protesters into custody about 10:45 a.m. after several hours of clearing. The street was reopened by 11 a.m. But several minutes later, traffic was block again as protesters walked out onto Summit.‚Äù Why is this continuing to be allowed? Why do the taxpayers get to spend so much money on "protecting‚Äù these ner-do-wells? Why does the city have to spend more money on cleaning up behind them? Is the street still closed because Coleman is afraid they'll show up at his door next? He is a coward. He'll do anything to gain the vote of people that don't have squat for brains. HEY COLEMAN......YOU LISTENING? GET YOUR BEHIND OUT THERE AND TELL THE OFFICERS TO CLEAR THE STREET. BE A MAN AND PUT YOUR BIG BOY PANTS ON. The Crusader This is NOT a time when the DFL is going to risk alienating their voting base. Look for more 'nudges' and more blocked public streets. Wblmi Coleman sits down to pee. Pat Cameron Closed again. There's a shocker. LaLaLaLLLESTER One million bucks and still counting for the cost of this particular protest. Well played BLM, well played... andyring These reprobates were sleeping on the sidewalk at 7:30 a.m.? Obviously they don't have jobs, meaning you and I are paying for their food and housing. Those protestors are as stupid and idiotic as the governor. Patricia Yep, I guess we are..... Highlander Peaceful protester? Goggles, bandanna, ready for the smoke and tear gas? WeekendThinker Now, that is ugly. Who buys his fancy digs? Patricia His Momma üòâ Big Twins Fan Oh snap! Patricia That's right!! Oh snap üôÇ Whodunnit What the heck? Who knew they sold googles with spikes intentionally used to harm anyone who comes close enough to arrest them. satmfs Spikes on goggles aren't very effective against nightsticks. MarvLS1 I wish I could have been there, but I have a job. Ms. Jones Ever heard of working at night or over there on an off day? I swear ppl are so ignorant to think that no one over there is unemployed. Some are off in the summers (if you work for a school district that is), some work over nights and some are there until 2-3 then go to work for the 2nd shift. Don't be so naive to think that all of them are unemployed. Be realistic. SMH WeekendThinker Maybe you need to spend some time in school. Your sentences make no sense. Your sentiment is just plain stupid. Most of the are known criminals and they don't have jobs. Have you not read so many of them that actually say they've been there since the start? Get educated before you make more of a fool of yourself. Ms. Jones All I said was don't be naive to think that all of them are unemployed. I must have hit a nerve. Do you have a job ‚Äì you are on here an awful lot. IJS ‚Äì how does anyone know they do not have a job somewhere. We don't. Just like we don't know a lot. We make assumptions. I wasn't disrespectful with what I said so don't be disrespectful to me. One more question since you know so much sweetie ‚Äì You listen to everything the media tells you about a person? Did they interview every person over there, have you been there and spoken to anyone? Doubt it so worry about getting facts before telling me I sound like a fool. You should look in the mirror sweetie. #LogOff WeekendThinker I have worked all of my life. My "entitlements‚Äù are my entitlements since I earned every single one of them. Most of those at the mansion have stated numerous times that they have been there from the start........they don't have jobs. I'm not you sweetie. I've had time to read a lot more than you think. I've read all sides and seen a lot more than you would even believe. You go ahead and log off. I am beginning to think you don't have a sweetie since you think calling me sweetie is ok. It isn't ...........fool GreaterMN "Sweetie‚Äù. Wow, ‚Äù Thinker‚Äù, you (and I) have been called lost of names by "Jay Eagle‚Äù (RIP) and others, but that one takes the proverbial cake! Glad you are enjoying your "entitlements‚Äù for (likely) many decades of hard work ‚Äì so am I. That does give us a certain "right‚Äù to be here during working hours. Were we of a different persuasion, we might be at our "Goofy House‚Äù with the nitwits ‚Äì of which few (if any) have yet to earn the entitlement to spend the day as they wish. Mac David Your amazing hiding behind your keyboard, and a bit of a door knob to suggest you have worked YOUR WHOLE LIFE. Did you help the doctors and your mother delivering you on entry to life or did you driver her home and cut the grass? MnMom88 It is you are, not your. GreaterMN Whoa! Ms. Jones and "Alumni69‚Äù have a new friend ‚Äì same attitude. satmfs Smells like a sock puppet to me. HM Wow that was as stupid a comment as I have seen. A little defensive are we? By making these aggressive comments, aren't you also hiding behind your keyboard? all heart Dumb Star Award for the day, for that statement. Infantile speech is a trait you Lefters seem to share. satmfs your adjective y…ôr, ÀàyuÃár, ÀàyoÃár Simple Definition of your : relating to or belonging to you : made or done by you you're yer, ÀàyuÃár, ÀàyoÃár, Àåy√º-…ôr Definition of you're : you are ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî You're welcome. be kind I know several people who are over there when they can be ‚Äì during off time from their jobs, etc. There are just some people who have a mental narrative of the people involved being lazy, etc., so they don't want to know the facts. I know a student who has two part-time jobs who has been there, someone who is a full-time mom who has been there, a retired person who has been there, and several full-time workers who have been there. WeekendThinker Then maybe they should be spending time with their kids instead of showing them how to break the law. These people are breaking the law. What part of that is ok? They're being taught that the cops are to be feared. That just isn't right. When the kids start stepping out in the street because they were taught it's ok, and get run over, then what? There are also full time, career protesters there. And they're losing more and more of the supporters they are trying to get. Bad behavior is not what you teach your kids. Of do they leave the kids home with daddy? Or isn't the a daddy at home. I'm sorry. These people get none of my support or sympathy. Play with fire, get burned. all heart Some of them are paid protesters paid with Soros and DNC and Clinton money. Be paid to do a criminal act is conspiracy and they all need prison, not jail, along with their criminal employers. be kind Any proof of that, all heart? You're probably going to say Alex Jones told you so, right? Absolutely ridiculous allegation. all heart Well, WCCO described the majority of the 46 arrested on I94 as being employed in the "social justice‚Äù field, "AKA paid demonstrators‚Äù. WCCO is a bastion of the Left Wing, not hardly Alex Jones. You are absolutely ridiculous for questioning me. Remember that half of the Ferguson rioters were from Oakland CA and complained loudly when they weren't paid on time after they were burning that town over the "Gentile Giant‚Äù. Mac David Maybe you should wait for the weekend since your having problems understanding reality during the week. HM Your right, not all but I'm sure a majority of them have no job and no clue what they are protesting for. These protests do more harm to the community and makes no sense in helping with the diversity . All it does is divide the people even more. Ms. Jones But this is America and people don't have to agree with how someone feels they should still respect it . I would hope that those that really don't understand why ppl are there protesting or supporting educate themselves. Philando was my friend. I have been over there to show support. I have family members in law enforcement. I understand and respect their roles. Bottom line is respect. Until there is accountability for the ones in law enforcement that ARE doing wrong there won't be any calm in regards to the protests. If they were held accountable for their actions people wouldn't have a reason to protest. I understand that some will never understand why people are upset and why they are protesting but again I encourage communication and dialogue ‚Äì ask someone you know, do some research, educate yourself. I don't bite and I am more than happy to have a conversation with anyone. I hope people will just take the time to communicate so that they may get a better understanding of why someone does something they don't understand. MnMom88 Respect is a two way street ‚Äì it feels like the protesters think it is only one way. If they want respect, then get out of the street and let the public use it for what it is intended. be kind How can you be sure? Have you gone over there and talked with the majority of them? Askov Smith Where are the white kids going next, Mr. Soros? WeekendThinker Go to jail, directly to jail. Do not pass go and certainly, most importantly, do NOT collect $200. Man. I'm full of it today. Maybe it's the heat. lol be kind You're kind of hung up on him, aren't you? He's an 85-year-old guy with a lot of better things to do than supervise a bunch of people in St. Paul. He is Jewish, though, which makes me think that some of your freaky conspiracy theories are actually fear of a well-to-do Jewish person. Askov Smith Hung up on him? No. Concerned at what he's doing to our great country? Yes. What does "Jewish‚Äù have to do with anything. I don't judge people by the silly little categories you seem to have created. You may have missed the reports showing that Soros and friends finance BLM and financed the Occupy group prior to this latest circus. His billions have financed many, many messed up liberal agenda items. Ignorance gets you no where "be kind‚Äù. Before accusing others of living by conspiracies and the fear of Jewish folks, you might want to educate yourself. I'm embarrassed for you... WeekendThinker So arrest them all. And don't just give them a slap on the hand saying not to do this again. If that's how it's handled, they'll be there till the governor is out of office. Again, the call goes out to the moron mayor......tell the cops to do what needs to be done and give the residents of that neighborhood back their street. These lazy cretins have nothing better to do than lay around sleeping all day and all night. They don't pay taxes. Why should they be allowed to continuously disrupt the people that actually have jobs and pay for the street they own houses on? Especially when most of them probably have 100 page criminal histories. Big Twins Fan WeekendThinker, I've seen your posts and agree with about 99.9999% of them. Just a warning though, you're showing way too much common sense to make it in this state! WeekendThinker I don't know if I should be insulted or flattered.............lol Thanks, either way. It is good to have conversation with people that converse instead of calling names every time, although I can fight with the best of them.......LOL Patricia It is refreshing, isn't it? Rob Bauman Arrest them when they break the law and get out the water cannons, they at least get a shower! LOL Oh yah, the water, kills no one! Where is that gutless mayor of St. Paul? Alumni69 Why not just release the dogs? How about firing live ammo into the crowd? The protester are terribly misguided, but the comments here frighten me. Racism is alive and well in Minnesota. WeekendThinker How is it racism? Have you even looked at the people out there? Give us a break. If you hate white people so badly as to call everyone a racist because we hate bad, criminal behavior, then why aren't you down on Summit getting yourself arrested? Gagmewaspoon Most of these morons are guilty white liberals. They keep the black ones around to get them coffee. WeekendThinker LOL Ms. Jones Are you surprised? I'm not ‚Äì not at all. And that is really sad. I was called a Ni$$er as a child by adults and kids and the ppl on here making comments would have probably been the ones chuckling along with the ones calling me the racist slurs. MN Nice my a$$. Bulls#it. Nice Where? WeekendThinker So leave. No one has you tied down to Minnesota. Ms. Jones Are you mad? I must have hit a nerve or you must not be in the greatest moods today. This is 2/2 ‚Äì I dont have to go anywhere and FYI I just said this isnt a MN Nice state as ppl want to portray it to be. We can have different opinions. Why are you so mad though? Explain for me if you don't mind. Thanks WeekendThinker We are tired of everyone blaming the police and all the white people for everything that goes wrong in their lives. St. Paul used to be a nice safe place to live. But with all the bad behavior, and criminals running the streets, you bet I'm mad. So are a lot of us. People need to take responsibility for their own actions. We're all tired of "poor me, I had a bad upbringing, that's why I don't do well in school and commit crimes with guns‚Äù. Sorry, but it is making a lot of people angry. The wrong people are being blamed for the death of a man we had nothing to do with. If you reach for a gun when an officer is telling you to sit still, well, you suffer the consequences. Now his family is without their son. The rest of society gets to pay the price? How does that make sense? Ms. Jones So do I blame the police for everything? I never said my upbringing was bad did I? My mother probably taught some of your relatives if you had kids go through SPPS in 70, 80, 90s and all the way until the mid/late 00s. I graduated with honors ‚Äì Thanks. I have a legal perit and firearm ‚Äì try again. What doesnt make sense is that you wont take the time to see where I was coming from or ask why I feel the way I do. Communication is what is lacking and common damn respect. I was able to experience the good in St Paul when I was young but i ALSO experienced the RACISM which is still alive today. Don't be in denial about ‚Äì try to see how to be apart of the change ‚Äì if you truly give a damn. Do you? And I am asking instead of assuming based on your comments you have previously left. I don't want to do to you what you did to me. When I shared that I was called a racial slur as a child and you told me so leave ‚Äì no one is tying me down to stay ‚Äì was it that serious for you to even go there? I dont think it was. That was harsh. I am a person with feelings and all I did was express what happened to me as a child and how these comments remind me of some of the people that called me names or snickered with the ones that called me names. Not looking for sympathy ‚Äì just giving my honest opinion which is what we are all allowed to do ‚Äì but why do you jump on me with such negative and "leave then‚Äù attitude over what I said was apart of my childhood here. Why not take a minute to say well damn Ms Jones ‚Äì I never thought about it that way ‚Äì you have enlightened me. I don't know what you should have done but that is what you could have done. You had a choice to either say something to make the situation better or for us to communicate but you chose the negative way. I just wish ppl would attempt to communicate vs being so hateful and negative. Have a good evening. WeekendThinker I've lived in this city my entire life, right smack dab in the middle of Lexington and University. I've seen this city go down the tubes with so many having no respect for anyone. The police have better things to do than protect a bunch of people that have nothing better to do. You think I haven't experienced racism? Sure I have. I let it run off my back. Anyone that thinks hating bad behavior is racist, so be it. Let them say what they want. Am I angry? Yes. I can't walk out my front door, where I've lived in peace for over 15 years, without being confronted with underwear hanging out, young children being completely ignored while mommy pays more attention to their phones than their kids. I've seen it all and I'm sick of it. Am I going to leave St. Paul? You bet. I'm sick and tired of all the blame being put on everyone except the criminals that are actually committing the crimes. And I don't care what they look like. Bad behavior by anyone is not acceptable in my upbringing, and for anyone to allow their kids to behave so badly and then defend them because someone was very wrong and evil 200 years ago, well, never blame the criminal. Use history as a really getting old excuse. I always have a good evening. Ms. Jones And I am the type of neighbor to check those same kids being disrespectful, sagging their pants, cursing or fighting and telling them we don't do that bs around here! I grew up in the same neighborhood for 35 mfkn years and am still there now and I do not stand for nonsense. Both sides of the nonsense. Do not judge ME based on what other people do or feel. I don't even understand your second to last sentence to respond to that. LOL and I hope you do sweetie. Goodnight <3 GreaterMN ‚Äù mfkn years‚Äù As you hoped, some us know what that means. Your credibility just went south with that slide into gutter terms. Ms. Jones So because I used a curse word (abbreviated) my "credibility went south with that slide into gutter terms‚Äù but ppl on here can call me a Norwegian which we all know is a shortened word for the N word. You are so high and mighty that you have never used a curse word in your life? LOL ‚Äì Stop it and have a seat please. Your opinion is appreciated but doesn't matter to me if you feel my credibility goes down south. You are not a factor or relevance to my everyday life. Thanks though. GreaterMN You are welcome. GreaterMN Reading your post again, I am intrigued by your reference to the proper noun "Norwegian‚Äù having any meaning beyond lutefisk-eating Norski ‚Äì which I am. That is a new one for me. Maybe living out here in the sticks insulates us from these new inferences for common (at last around here) proper nouns. Antileftist Unfortunately your voice isn't the one being broadcast by the news outlets. Reports of blood and controversy cause people to watch/read news articles. A story about you being a fine upstanding citizen doesn't make for high viewership. be kind I rarely look at the comments here any more because every time I do I see the same old pro-right wing anti-black commenters on here. It's tiresome. But, when you think about it, it means that the PiPress can declare a certain amount of readership based on activity in the comments. Therefore, if you want to encourage less "blood and controversy,‚Äù you could comment less on these articles. Right? Aren't you all feeding the cycle of gloom here? GreaterMN Yep, here we are in droves. Over on the Strib boards as well ‚Äì when they permit it. I would be careful with the anti-black accusations, however. That doesn't apply across the board just because we are "pro-right wing‚Äù. GreaterMN "Us‚Äù? Who's "us‚Äù ‚Äì you and "Alumni69‚Äù? There was a time not long ago that many of us ‚Äì those you now accurately characterize as "angry‚Äù by our comments here ‚Äì were beginning to positively communicate/dialog with your "us‚Äù. In the case of "WeekendThinker‚Äù (I am guessing) and yours truly (for sure), the recent events of civil disobedience and the rhetoric of the BLM folks have undone years of progress. Unfortunately, your "pity me‚Äù is doing little to undo that damage. Most of us are not David Duke clones, and value the concept of Minnesota Nice. So how do you propose we turn this around? Ms. Jones What? The "us‚Äù meant he and I. It had nothing to do with you. Whodunnit That bus to Pittsburgh goes in both directions Ms. Jones What does that even mean?? I was born AND raised here sweetie. I left after COLLEGE TO GO TO GRAD SCHOOL IN PGH. MnMom88 MN Nice does not apply to people who have been breaking laws, and monopolizing a public street. BLM has tried everyone's patience ‚Äì no more MN Nice. Ms. Jones So when I was a child being called the N word I was breaking a law or monopolizing the public street? So what was the excuse in your opinion? Just curious. Was there an excuse for it? MnMom88 I'm not sure how my comment relates to yours. I am referring to the protesters that have been camped out in a public street. Standing on the sidewalk is not breaking the law, camping in the street is. It needs to stop because it is interfering with the law and the rights of others. Ms. Jones There was an issue with MN Nice before 2014 ‚Äì if we are being honest. I am 38 years old born and raised here. Not a criminal, educated, hard working citizen and as a child was called the N word. So if we are being honest it started being that way years ago before BLM started so blaming them is silly and unrealistic in my opinion. HM You say you are offended by a white person calling you the N word, yet when your own call you that it's ok? When black people have no respect for their own race what makes you think others will also? Ms. Jones Did I say I allow it? Do you know that I am okay with that? As I said in another response I am the neighbor that CHECKS all the kids in my neighborhood in regards to when i see them fighting, doing anything they have no business doing, sagging, cursing or anything that WE (me and them) both know they have no business doing. I also have 4 kids that I make sure I am watching and involved with heavily outside when they play so I know all of the kids. You saying that I use the N word is like me saying that you are ok with pedophiles in your churches and just look the other way. Don't put your assumptions of what you think all African Americans are ok with ‚Äì next time ask first ‚Äì I might be able to enlighten you. Antileftist I'm sorry that you were called that word as a child. As a child, my parents moved around a great deal and I had to change schools quite often. Usually I was ostracized by the existing kids in each school and as such I usually made friends with other kids who suffered the same fate. Usually those kids were minorities. Those kids were pleasant to be around and we had a lot of shared experiences. I've had 5 different black gentlemen rent rooms from me in my house and am still close friends with 3 of them, years later. I've spoken with all 3 of them and they are disgusted with BLM. They've told me that they haven't had issues with being profiled in Mn. All 3 of them expressed support for the police. 2 of them have been law abiding all their lives and are grateful that they were able to resist the temptations they faced as kids. They credit strong parenting for their positions in life today. One of them spent 6 years in prison for drugs/weapons charges. He said that if he'd have had a good father while growing up that he probably wouldn't have gotten in trouble. Today he holds a good job in a factory. I may dislike BLM, but not because they are black. My opinions are formed from discussion with those 3 friends. I think BLM is misguided and have been infiltrated by paid anarchists who have a larger agenda to cause unrest, no matter the issue. The results of the Jamar Clark case, Mike Brown case and Freddie Gray case, tell me that BLM doesn't care about reality, only causing trouble. There seems to be little common sense in leadership. GreaterMN The dogs won't go near them. The smell noted above would have to be so intense as to kill the poor pooches with their enhanced olfactory function. Whodunnit Firing live ammo? What do they look like, gang bangers in No Mpls??? HM Are you serious? Seems you are the one who keeps bringing racism up every time you make a comment. Call BLM, maybe they can protect you if you're so frightened. all heart You finally had a good Idea. Frank Loncar That would have worked better when they wanted to disrupt Crashed Ice. Alumni69 "Occupying‚Äù Summit Avenue in front of the governor's mansion serves no purpose whatsoever, except to alienate the general public and seriously damage BLM's image. The whole protest has turned into a disorganized mess. GreaterMN There you are. Back with the majority opinion. MarvLS1 BLM is a phony astro-turf group created by George Soros and other socialist globalists to cause chaos and mayhem. Castile was far from a model citizen, and he looked exactly like a robbery suspect and he acted as if he was going for his gun. Maybe the cop overreacted, but the fact is it was Castile's behavior that led to his death. Protesting and rioting isn't going to solve the real problem ‚Äì which is the criminal community. But I know liberals won't hear those inconvenient truths. Liberals believe all cultures and sub-cultures, values, beliefs, etc. are equal. Thus, any inequality must be the result of unfairness or injustice. So it's not the criminal culture that has infested the Black Community that is to blame for the high murder rate and other crime rates within the Black Community that is to blame for these incidents, but it's the fault of the unfairness of inequality. It's a sick and deluded philosophy that leads people to riot over a criminal who gets killed resisting arrest, yet they say nothing and do nothing about the rash of bigotry inspired Islamic killings and rapes that are happening all over the world right now. Why is that? Because they side with the Islamics for the same reason they side with the criminal rather than the cop. This is how sick liberalism is, and if the people of the great left-wing state of Minnesota don't wake up soon, the whole place will look like Damascus in a few years. Nom de Plume "... seriously damage BLM's image....‚Äù that's funny... they have an image of some positive value? HM Image of what are we talking about? Has there ever been a BLM protest that hasn't pissed people off or disrupt the community they are in? Antileftist Heck, this is one of the few cities where they haven't burned down neighborhoods. GreaterMN Don't give "them‚Äù any fresh ideas! I was here (and in Chicago) during the "Burn, Baby, Burn‚Äù episode. We do not need a repeat of that. It did, however, result in some unintended (but needed) urban renewal. all heart Only because they know that the shooting will start. DavefromMinn I say let them stay. Its not like there are any Republicans living on millionaires Summit Ave anyway. The protesters actually seem to trying to police themselves a bit. Whodunnit So its okay that people who live on Summit Ave can't even get to their homes? WeekendThinker Some people just don't get the concept of people buying houses and expecting to be allowed to access them. And some people know, simply by the addresses, who belongs to what political party. Wish I were that smart. I could fit all those brains in a thimble. DavefromMinn If they can impose Mark Dayton, Al Franken, and Hillary Clinton on me, I can impose BLM on them. I have more sympathy for North Mpls residents. LaLaLaLLLESTER Most of the city blocks on both sides of Summit Ave have alleys those rich folks use to park their Benzs in their garages that border on the alleys.. Whodunnit You sound jealous. Perhaps you should have gone to college and landed a good job so you could afford to live on Summit. Meanwhile, this incident happened in another city...why should the St Paul residents and police have to deal with this trash? MarvLS1 Liberal richie rich hypocrites like Dayton can't get to their homes...boo hoo. They care so much let them give their homes to the criminals they care so much about. WeekendThinker They work and pay taxes. That give them the right to have access to their homes. Where do you live? They can camp in your yard and block you from your home. See how well that works for you? teaminfidel911 at least we know they won't be there at 12:01am next monday. WeekendThinker Is that welfare day? DavefromMinn Have you ever been to the University Ave Walmart on the first of the month. They have the check cashing counter upfront. WeekendThinker I don't do Walmart. I leave that for the shopper/shoplifters. They spend their days there. Since you're so familiar, do you see them in person? Or are you making assumptions? Whodunnit Black Lives Matter St Paul is mad...mad I tell you! They posted that the DOJ will be hearing from them soon. Hello....it's me!!! (dead air on the end) WeekendThinker Won't they be surprised when the DOJ tells them to get the heck out of the streets? RobbinBri First things first...make them take a shower. Ewww...that holding smell....sorry, holding cell must be ripe! GreaterMN One look at that guy above, and the porky broad loading her car gave me the same thought. 3m_t@3 Better yet, no shower...lock up em up nice and smelly. HM Why?
