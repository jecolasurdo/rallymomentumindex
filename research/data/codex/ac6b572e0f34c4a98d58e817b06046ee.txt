Wednesday's march Wednesday's began at noon in the upper parking lot at Felts Park and continued along the sidewalk to the Galax Police Department courtyard, where the marchers spent nine minutes of silence either kneeling in deference or lying facedown on the bricks with their hands behind their backs in the position Floyd died in. Those nine minutes symbolized the amount of time a police officer knelt on Floyd's neck before he died; a video of the killing ignited protests around the nation and world in the past week. After this, Dondea Young, who organized the march, opened the floor to anyone who wanted to speak about the issues at hand. The marchers were a racially diverse group; some were black, some white and a few were Hispanic; several were young people. Many carried posters and wore T-shirts with slogans like "Black Lives Matter,” "I Can't Breathe” (a callback to Floyd's words as he was dying), "No Justice, No Peace,” "Police Brutality Must End” and "I Choose Love, Hate Is Too Great of a Burden to Bear.” Denise Davis of Woodlawn carried a sign with the legend, "I Stand For My Children, Black Lives Matter.” A white woman who has foster parented black children, she said tearfully of her decision to march, "I swore that I would never be silent when it comes to them being talked about. I made a promise to each one of them that I would never stand by and let them be discriminated against.” Davis said she heard about the march from Facebook. "In 2020 we shouldn't have to do this,” Young said, "but we pray that these babies won't have to do what we're doing.” Young brought a cooler with bottled water, as did law enforcement: representatives of the Galax Police Department, Carroll County and Grayson County sheriffs' offices and the Hillsville and Independence police departments were present from beginning to end. They set up coolers of water along the way so that marchers could refresh themselves. "We're going to make this as peaceful as possible,” said Galax Police Chief DeWitt Cooper. "I don't expect any trouble.” In a crowd of approximately 70 people, most wore cloth masks to meet the governor's COVID-19 regulations. Statements from Officials At the beginning of the event, but before the walking began, all present formed a prayer circle and were led by Sheriff Kevin Kemp of Carroll County. Kemp offered a heartfelt prayer to God "that we all learn to love one another as you love us, and learn to love our neighbor as ourselves... go with us and lead us and guide us.” Cooper offered to have law enforcement walk in front or behind at the marcher's discretion; they ended up walking in front, with a vehicular escort in back. The march took perhaps 10 minutes. After the observation of silence, speakers took turns. Law enforcement began the roughly 45 minutes of speeches by various participants. "In any profession we are in, there is always a bad seed in that profession. We hold the position of law enforcement in high regard, because they are the ones who took an oath to serve and protect us,” Young said as she introduced representatives of local law enforcement. To those quick to blame law enforcement as a whole, Young was quick to defend the majority, stating, "People want to say all cops are bad cops, but this isn't so. You see all the law enforcement here who have stepped up. I thank you for your service. Your job is not easy and you put your lives on the line.” Young also condemned those who have taken advantage of protests across the nation — rioters, looters and vandals, many of which have been called out as opportunists or those who seek to create trouble amidst a peaceful attempt at change. "This is not our intention at all. We just want to come together. Your voice is everyone's voices. You have a right to be heard. We all must stand together, all for one and one for all.” Cooper, in a heartfelt address to the public, stated that each department shared the same outrage over what occurred in Minneapolis, and the continued pattern that they never wish to emulate. "We are here to protect and serve with the support of [our citizens]. I am sure the sheriffs, troopers, attorneys and all who are standing here feel the same way that I do. We are accountable to our citizens, our elected officials, and ourselves,” Cooper said. "Our community can show others the way to peace. I hope you take the energy from today and turn it into action tomorrow. Get involved in community elections. Get to know someone who has a different opinion than yours.” Grayson County Sheriff Richard Vaughan echoed a sentiment offered earlier by Cooper: that the people who hate bad cops the most are good cops. "What happened was unreasonable. In our profession, we are taught to use the amount of force that is reasonable. There is nothing reasonable about pinning a knee down on a man's neck for eight minutes,” Vaughan said. "Our officers are very well trained. There are no excuses for the actions that took place in Minneapolis. The investigation is still underway, but we can do better. We get it right here in rural communities; why can't larger cities?” (The officer who killed Floyd has been charged with murder; three other officers are charged with lesser offenses for their part in the killing.) Kemp took a stand next, stating, "We take this seriously. We owe it to our citizens and we stand with you and want to do the right thing.” Hillsville Police Chief Shannon Goad and Independence Police Chief James Wagoner also shared similar statements on behalf of their departments. "People like you who are organizing and doing what you are doing makes a difference in a powerful way. We have to love and support one another. Your law enforcement is here for you, and we support you,” said Goad. Wagoner said of the community, "It is an honor to serve here locally.” As a member of law enforcement, he added that he has seen the fear in the black community first-hand. "To see the fear in their eyes... we see it and it's not good. But hopefully we can make progress and [events like this] will make even more progress. It's all we can do, and try to better ourselves.” Grayson County Commonwealth's Attorney Brandon Boyles said that it was "uplifting to see so many young people here and taking a stand and getting involved. I am proud of you guys for doing this peacefully, and doing it the right way.” Continuing, Boyles said: "We are fortunate to have a diverse community; people in all walks of life all races. I have young children, and I hope that we can take what we're doing here today, [our children will] go out in the world and hopefully little by little we'll make an impact.” Carroll County Commonwealth's Attorney Roger Brooks stated that he is also available for anyone who needs help. "Everyone knows the story of the Good Samaritan,” he said. "Jesus asked us, 'Who is your neighbor?' And told us the story of a man beaten half to death on the side of the road. That, Jesus said, is our neighbor. He is the person you are going to help, and who you are going to love. You look out for and take care of your neighbors.” Travis Haynes, a member of the Galax City Council, also attended the event. He told the crowd, "I got involved in council because I wanted to make a change.” He also told those in attendance that citizens' words and actions do have power. "We have to get in a position and start fighting You have to assume you have that right and step into it. That is how things are changed,” Haynes said. Vicky Taylor, a resource officer for Galax schools, stated, "We have to keep teaching our children to see past all of this racism and ugliness, and let them know we are all one unit.” Vaughan spoke with The Gazette after the protest. "The criminal justice system to me is like a wheel with a lot of spokes,” he said. "Each one of those spokes are independent and make their own decisions; 99% of all police officers in the country are good. It's less than 1% that makes those bad decisions. It's a shame that many people are taking this out on all these cities and officers.” Of that 1%, Vaughan said, "I believe we need to focus on intervening. These larger municipalities have hundreds or thousands of officers, and it's probably much more difficult to manage that large of a force. Emotional management is so important. A lot of officers get into pursuits, shootings or other incidents that may be emotionally stressful. We as officers cannot let our emotions interfere with our performance.” The sheriff stated that he wished officials at the state level would have been more involved. "Our higher-ups in Richmond and the agencies under their direction should be showing more unity during all this.” Citizens Speak Out Seventeen-year-old Emily Juarez – a Hispanic student at Grayson County High School, with the words "I can't breathe” Sharpied onto her stomach — said, "You shouldn't have to worry about going to school and being called names, like 'a beaner' or 'a wetback' or any kind of racial name there is. To leave your home and be afraid of being shot or tackled or just attacked in any way possible. And that is what we are here to change and I thank you all for being here.” Kristina Sawyers of Woodlawn stood with four children at the protest. "I want everybody to look at a child,” she said. "Black, white, Latino, mixed. Think about their future. Think about how when they go to bigger cities, they get treated like trash. I got treated like trash in New York. They called me 'ni--er,' 'wetback;' they didn't even know my race! An officer came up to me and about put me down. But we have to think, if we don't stop this, our kids will have to go through it. You want to think stuff like that won't happen... but not everybody's good. It's very scary.” Sawyers said of protests, "The most peaceful protest I've ever seen was this one right here.” She praised its tone of unity, asking "What do violence and looting have to do with racism?” One citizen, Chris Kelley of Woodlawn, gave a fiery speech at full volume in support of those gathered and said that if anyone was discriminated against "because of your race, I will stand with you, side by side. I served in the Marine Corps to protect ALL your rights, and this stuff pi--es me off!” Many speakers commended the event for being peaceful. One offered, "Let us do this protest in peace and love and let the healing start here. Our nation is more divided now and getting worse every day.” A black male protestor, only 15 years old, stated that he is already afraid of what the world has in store for him. "I can't understand this, because no one is born a racist,” he said in an emotional and passionate speech to the crowd. "I don't understand how you could tell your son or daughter to hate someone because of their skin color. In God's eyes, we are all equal. I'm 15 years old and this makes me scared. I just hope the world sees change and we can be the generation that at least calms it down.” United We Stand Perhaps most surprising, when compared with the division that is seen currently throughout the nation, was the presence of Second Amendment activist Ravin Lee Bilbrey, along with four local members of the Three Percenters, described as a far-right militia movement and paramilitary group that advocates gun ownership rights and resistance to the federal government's involvement in local affairs. Two of the quartet carried what appeared to be assault rifles. When questioned, the members told The Gazette they were there to protect the marchers' rights "to exercise First Amendment rights anywhere, anytime, which is what those great people over there are doing,” and to keep any violence from erupting. Later, during the speeches, the group appeared behind the protestors in the square. Bilbrey approached to make clear the group's intentions. "I don't know if you've noticed me and these other guys who have weapons out here. But we're here to support the freedom of speech. We support anyone's constitutional rights; it isn't just about the Second Amendment. This community right here is totally different than anywhere else. We'll teach everyone out there how to come together.” Vaughan said later, "I did ask them, 'You're not trying to intimidate anybody?' They're Grayson County boys and I know them all, so I went up there and talked to them.” He said he felt reassured that they were not present for any negative purpose. Bilbrey, however, was invited by Young; she noted that they were friends and had gone to school together. She said that while the Three Percenters had not been specifically invited, one of them spoke to her afterwards, thanked her for organizing the protest, "and stated that the march was a much-needed idea for this area.” She also said, "I would just like to say that today was absolutely amazing. I'm thankful and grateful to all who came out to support the cause. This march needed to be done. It was long overdue.” Another march, organized by Houston Dixon of Hillsville, is also planned for the same route on Friday, beginning at 6 p.m. Dixon said she planned it for Galax because "it's centrally located, so people don't necessarily have to travel as far.” Young said "I will be in attendance Friday to march with Houston.” Friday's march "If all we do is march and cheer then honestly, it's been a waste of time,” said Dixon on Friday at a Galax protest march. Though Friday evening's event was peaceful, it was anything but subdued. Most protesters wore masks in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As Wednesday's march, members of the Three Percenters were on hand. Also as before, they appeared to function as auxiliary security. Dixon organized the event, which began at Felts Park, went up Main Street to the police station courtyard, and ended with a march back to Felts, the same route as the first march. However, while Wednesday's noon protest was heartfelt but restrained, Friday's march rebounded off that energy as a fierce, fiery cry for justice — and for building community. After a brief prayer, a crowd of approximately 200 people started off from the park, bearing signs and chanting "George Floyd!” and "Black lives matter!” Floyd died on May 25 in Minneapolis while under arrest, as a police officer knelt on his neck. Some protestors bore signs referring to Breonna Taylor of Kentucky, who died on March 13, shot in her apartment by Louisville police who had gone to the wrong address. Upon reaching the courtyard on North Main, Dixon opened the second part of the event. In a rapid-fire speech, she offered that, in memory of Floyd and the other members of the black community, the Galax and surrounding communities could use these tragic examples to fuel real change. "Change starts here. It starts with white people stepping up, sitting down, and listening to black voices. It starts with white people educating themselves and giving black people the space to flourish and to prosper,” said Dixon. "Galax is a great community. Galax is our community. Hatred is not welcome here, racism is not welcome here!” Similar to Wednesday's event, she then led a silent vigil in which protesters either knelt in prayer or laid face-down on the ground for approximately eight minutes and 46 seconds — the exact amount of time it took before Floyd's body gave out from asphyxiation while pinned under the knee of a law enforcement officer. When everyone stood back up, Dixon reminded the crowd that "If that felt like a long time, that's because it was.” She exhorted the crowd, "We must begin arming ourselves, not with guns or weapons, but with compassion and love for our fellow man.” Dixon, who is white, did not pull punches about the responsibility of other white people to not simply voice solidarity but demonstrate it: "We've been doing the bare minimum for too long.” • Haynes, invited by Dixon to speak again at Friday's event, also addressed anger as he offered, "We welcome your anger, because through anger there is change.” He spurned giving in to violence, but said, "You can be a good angry, because it spurs you to go on and do something” Haynes gestured towards Verl Brown, a Galax High School coach and Haynes' mentor. "He provided fathering when I didn't have fathering. He inspired me. He told me I could be something, and he's been something his whole life.” He also encouraged everyone to participate in local politics to effect change: "I want to see you at city council meetings!” His sentiments were echoed by Council Member Beth White: "My prayer is that you will take the hope that is within you, and unite the people around you, and let's do something together.” • Young said on Friday that, "This is the Galax community saying that enough is enough, and we are sick and tired of being sick and tired.” She noted that "this is the most unity I have ever seen” in her community. To the youth in attendance, she offered, "The foundation has been laid, and your voice can now be heard. You don't have to live in fear... We have to walk arm in arm, hand in hand. We've got to stand up and put [racism and discrimination] back where it came from: the pits of hell!” • Savannah Taylor of the Facebook group LocALL Rising, shared her deep love for the community at the protest, stating, "I've been fortunate to live all over the world; but there is just something about this community. I always feel a pull back to this place, and I love this place.” Taylor continued, "But when you love something, you have to commit to loving it fully; even the things that make you uncomfortable. I've heard a lot of people say that they were glad we're not like a big city. And I am, too. I do not condone violence and I do not want to see the small businesses I love destroyed. But just because we don't have the same issues here, does not mean we don't have issues.” Her next words were arresting. "I grew up 10 miles from where a black man was burned and beheaded. This community doesn't speak his name.” Taylor was referring to the brutal 1997 murder of Garnett Paul "G.P.” Johnson, a 40-year-old black handyman from Grayson County. "In 2015, the KKK was putting literature in mailboxes in this community,” Taylor said. "This week on Facebook, somebody said that mixed race marriages are not of God. You let that sit a minute; because that sends a message to biracial people like me.” Taylor continued: "I'm not saying any of this to say we don't have a wonderful, loving community. But we have to confront the things that make us uncomfortable. We have to come together with open hearts, open minds and closed mouths. We can make this community a better place for my boys, for me, and for each of you. I am committed to each and every one of you. I love you dearly. I want to feel like each and every one of you love me back.” • "I want to say this past week, I have been more angry than I can remember ever being in my life,” said Kisha Johnson of God's Storehouse and Soup Kitchen in Galax. "When I watched that man die on the ground, it brought a kind of pain that I didn't even know that I could feel,” she told the crowd. "So I was mad. We're all angry. We have a right to be angry. But like Travis said, it's what we do with that anger matters. It can be either destruction, or it can be construction.” She encouraged everyone to educate themselves about racial realities in America, starting with Jane Elliott's blue eye/brown eye experiment, documented on YouTube, but advised, "Learning hurts. Growing pain hurts... before we reach out, we've got to reach in.” • Verl Brown offered to lead the group in prayer. But before he began, he reminded everyone, "We all bleed the same. It started with love. We were created in the image of God; and his image is a perfect image of love.” He said he was "glad to see that we could march hand in hand, even though we couldn't hold hands” — a nod to the pandemic — "but we were marching side by side.” He also spoke on the subject of teaching youth about tolerance, respect and love early. Brown offered that when growing up, he experienced segregation firsthand. He went to an all-black school, until he attended classes in Galax and shared classrooms with the white students for the first time. "The one thing that I learned: we have to love one another. I may not have money, but there isn't a person in Galax who can beat me in love. I love everybody,” Brown said. • Perhaps the boldest speech of the event came from Chief Cooper. As a black man and a law enforcement officer, Cooper had a perspective that made him uniquely suited to address the nation's current crisis. "This evening I stand with you, and we, the Galax Police Department, share the outrage that so many feel in our communities and across the country by the death of Mr. George Floyd,” he began. "Here in Galax and the surrounding Twin Counties, law enforcement strives to be professional, compassionate and ethical in our approach to protect and serve,” he continued. "The Galax Police Department motto is 'Making a Safer City All Day Every Day.'” He noted that part of law enforcement's job is maintaining its own integrity. "We hold ourselves accountable. We are also accountable for our actions to our citizens and our elected officials. It is incumbent upon each law enforcement professional to shine a light on and remove those individuals in our profession who choose to disgrace our badge and honor. One bad officer across the country has repercussions on the whole profession. If we as law enforcement stay quiet, we are doing a disservice to ourselves and our citizens.” Cooper added, "Here in Galax, a rural part of Virginia, we can show others how to co-exist peacefully. We are not perfect; however, we will not condone racism or discrimination, just as we will not condone rioting and looting.” However, in pledging to uphold the law and keep all citizens safe, he made no bones about his meaning. "I want to be clear: all lives matter. However, today we are talking specifically about African-American lives. Everyone is here to protest the images we see of African-Americans being disrespected, abused and killed by law enforcement across our country.” The next part of his speech drew explosive cheers after each statement. "Stereotypes lead to wrong assumptions,” Cooper began. "African-Americans are not all drug dealers. Latinos are not all gang members. Middle Easterners are not all ISIS. Caucasians are not all racists. Not all addicts want to be that way. Law enforcement are not all bad actors.” He continued, "Young people, you are our future. Today I ask you to take this energy you are feeling and put it into positive action tomorrow. Get involved with your local law enforcement departments with events like ride-a-longs, neighborhood watches, local elections; get involved with your community. Open your hearts and minds. Your experiences and point of view may not be those of others, however they are real and should not be dismissed or disrespected. Step out of your comfort zone and get to know somebody with different experiences.” At the end of his speech, a young black man in the audience asked Cooper if there were any outstanding complaints lodged against his officers, pointing out that the officer responsible for George Floyd's death had numerous complaints against him. "Is there [anybody on your force] I need to be worried about?” Cooper said that while complaints being filed against officers is standard, "like anything else; we verify any and every complaint.” He noted that Galax officers also use body cameras. • On the march back to Felts, Young said, "We're making all the right steps forward. I'm glad to see everybody that came out. It was a larger turnout than Wednesday's. It impacted the entire community when they saw that we were peaceful. They wanted to come out and support it.” Dixon's parting words about the protest were terse but pointed with meaning. "It went great.” She paused, then listed the names of black people who have died as a result of police brutality. "Trayvon (Martin). Eric (Garner). Emmett Till. George Stinney. These are the names we say over and over. Miss Breonna Taylor. These are the names we have to say. It's not about me. It's not about white people. These are the names we must say until they get justice.” Add new comment Read and share your thoughts on this story NewsBusinessCourtsEducationGovernmentPublic SafetySportsHigh SchoolGolfRacingOutdoorsSports BriefsOpinionColumnsLettersFeaturesMusic & ArtsTravelFamilyReligionClub NewsCommunity NewsMilestonesMore ContentBlogsObituariesCalendarClassifiedEmploymentFarm & GardenLegalsMerchandisePetsReal EstateServicesVehiclesAbout UsSubscribe Get the paper Create/manage your profile Refund Policy Privacy policy, terms and conditions About Us Copyright © 2020 Declaration is your source for local news, sports, events and information in Independence, VA, and the surrounding area.
