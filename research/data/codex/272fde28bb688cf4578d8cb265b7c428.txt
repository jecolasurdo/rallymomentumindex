DeSoto school board president Carl Sherman released the following statement: "Our students are constantly exposed to the realities facing our Nation today, specifically the reality of what it means to be a minority in a society with implicit biases. In DeSoto, we teach our students to become thought leaders and active participants in their educational process. While their actions may make some people uncomfortable, I applaud these students for exercising their first amendment rights in a civil, non-confrontational way. "Our students are witnessing the erosion of the 14th amendment right before their eyes. A lesson in liberty and justice, once reserved for textbooks, is now on full display in streets across our Nation. One can only imagine the fear in their hearts watching these events unfold.

It is my prayer that it makes all the difference for our students, our community and these United States of America." DeSoto ISD Superintendent Dr. David C. Harris released the following statement Wednesday: // <![CDATA[ DV.load("https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3111892-2016-Kneel-Anthem-Letter.js", { width: 650, height: 800, sidebar: false, text: false, container: "#DV-viewer-3111892-2016-Kneel-Anthem-Letter" }); // ]]> 2016-Kneel-Anthem-Letter (PDF) 2016-Kneel-Anthem-Letter (Text) NBC 5's Chris Jose contributed to this report.
