The march began as a gathering at Washington High School in support of Black Lives Matter and to protest the killing of George Floyd. The group of about 300 demonstrators marched about two miles through the downtown area to police headquarters on the 2000 block of Stevenson Ave. The department said it had boosted its staffing just in case, but did not anticipating any problems. People of all ages participated and police facilitated road closures so the protesters were able to walk in the road. No looting, vandalism or violence was reported by police. Fremont's 8 p.m. curfew is still in effect through Monday, although officials said they would reevaluate it over the weekend. While Alameda, Contra Costa and San Mateo counties rescinded their curfews on Thursday, Fremont is among a handful of Bay Area cities with curfews still in effect, although the curfew was amended to end on Friday morning instead of Monday.
