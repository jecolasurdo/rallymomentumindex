"There is something about Hampden that racist people feel comfortable here" (WJZ 13) A Baltimore vigil honoring the black victim of an accused white killer's racist manhunt turned into a shouting match Saturday night between demonstrators and hecklers offended by the "Black Lives Matter" banners.

In a city where the population is more than 60% black, nearly 79% of the neighborhood's residents are white, according to demographic statistics from Baltimore's department of health. St. Luke's pastor, Vicar Jim Muratore, said he is "ashamed" of Hampden's past. "We cannot ignore the history that cultivated Hampden's reputation as a neighborhood to which African American people do not go," Muratore said in a Facebook post.

Hampden was a stronghold for the Ku Klux Klan for generations. Landlords bought up houses to keep out 'the blacks.' Even our own church hosted black-face minstrel shows as a popular event for the community. Yes. That's racist." Protesters expressed their condolences for the victim. "This horror began right here," Baltimore City Councilwoman Mary Pat Clarke told the group. "We are ashamed, distressed and in sympathy with his family in New York.
