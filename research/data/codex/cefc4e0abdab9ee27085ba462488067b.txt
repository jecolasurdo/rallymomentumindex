"This is about black lives matter," co-organizer Sabrina Conteh told the crowd of more than 70 before the march began. "Jimmie Sanders was murdered because he was black and was not given due process, was not given the right to be told that a gun would be present and that he might be shot. His life didn't matter in that moment and that's why we're here."Jimmie Montel Sanders, 33, was fatally shot by Appleton police Lt. Jay Steinke early in the morning of May 21.

Another sign read, "Release the footage," a reference to video of the shooting."We're not going away, this is not going to go away until we understand the truth, until this family can get peace of mind of what took place, what happened to their loved one, and until these citizens get a peace of mind of what took place in a bar that's open to the public and an innocent man died," Lowe told reporters before the protest started.FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInAppleton protest in police shooting of Jimmie Sanders FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

At the intersection of College and State Street, police temporarily blocked traffic. They did not interact with the group.The protest was peaceful, although some observers debated protesters about the circumstances that led to the shooting of Sanders.Andrea Guenther-Paul, a 50-year-old Appleton resident, said she participated in the march to support "marginalized residents in our community" and to support Sanders' family. Guenther-Paul added that she suspected that Appleton "could one day be part of the national conversation" about criminal justice, racism and policing."These are systemic issues and Appleton isn't immune to them," she told a USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin reporter on Saturday. Conteh and co-organizer Anmol Gupta, Lawrence University juniors, called for:The release of any body camera footage from the shooting by the end of the week.The release of all incident reports or grievances filed against Steinke in his career in policing.That Steinke immediately be placed on indefinite unpaid leave, if he is not already.That the investigation be moved from the Green Bay Police Department to a different department, given that Appleton Police Chief Todd Thomas worked at the Green Bay Police Department before being hired as Appleton's chief â€” a connection they called a conflict of interest.That there be a federal investigation into whether the shooting was a civil rights violation.RELATED: Milwaukee man charged in Jack's Apple Pub shootingRELATED: Police ID man killed in bar shootingRELATED: Thomas seeks transparency as Appleton's police chief"(Steinke) is not working until after the conclusion of the investigation and a decision is made by the (district attorney), who is overseeing the investigation and will determine what the disposition of the case is," Thomas wrote in an email to USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin on Friday.Police have said they would not comment again until the full investigation is released.Gupta expressed concern over Thomas' previous work at the Green Bay Police Department. Thomas was the captain of investigations at the department when he became Appleton police chief in 2015. Thomas started working at Green Bay in 1988."Come on, is that fair?" Gupta said to the crowd. "That's a conflict of interest. We need federal investigators to come in here, at the very least, move this ... out of the Green Bay Police Department."Steinke and another officer ran into the College Avenue bar after people ran out yelling that there was someone shooting inside, according to preliminary information released by Thomas last Sunday. Steinke saw a man with a gun and shot at him, Thomas said previously.Henry Nellum â€” the man accused of shooting at another man, Leander Moffitt, inside the bar, bringing police inside â€” was charged Tuesday. Nellum's gun was found under a vehicle outside the bar, according to the criminal complaint, and authorities have made no mention to date of a second gun being recovered.From information released so far, Sanders' involvement in the fight between Moffitt and Nellum, if any, remains unclear.Sanders was taken to a local hospital, but died.A protest stemming from the fatal police shooting of Jimmie Montel Sanders moves along College Avenue from Houdini Plaza to Jack's Apple Pub on Saturday.

I don't mind criminals going to jail, and I don't mind people paying the price for their actions. Do you follow me?""Yes," the group responded."So when an innocent man dies, we're supposed to do this because when an innocent life is lost, that could be us," he said. "It could be you, it could be a family member."Alison Dirr: 920-996-7266 or adirr@gannett.com; on Twitter @AlisonDirr; Madeleine Behr: 920-996-7226, or mbehr@postcrescent.com; on Twitter @madeleinebehrCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://post.cr/2s1YHnBFind JobsShare your feedback to help improve our site experience!
