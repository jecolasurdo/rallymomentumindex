Across from Mayor Luke Bronin's home Friday night, Bishop John Selders sat in a lawn chair tapping lightly on a drum, flanked by several dozen others who sang quietly. Their message: Stop the police violence. In the past seven days, two black men had been shot by police, first in Tulsa, Okla., then in Charlotte, N.C.

Before protesting outside Bronin's home, Selders, a founding member of Moral Monday CT, had led more than 100 protesters from the busy intersection of Main Street and Albany Avenue to the doorstep of the city's public safety building on High Street.

This protest was held in response to the shooting of 40-year-old Terence Crutcher in Tulsa by an officer even though Crutcher had his hands above his head. The officer in the case has been charged with manslaughter. In Charlotte, Keith Lamont Scott, was also killed by an officer. (Lauren Schneiderman / Hartford Courant) "Here we are again," Selders let out through a bullhorn, as the protesters gathered. They had marched there several months earlier after police shootings in Minnesota and Louisiana. "I don't know about you, but I'm hurt, I'm upset and I'm pissed off that I live in the land of the free and the home of the brave, yet I don't feel so free and I certainly don't feel so brave," Selders said. The group said it is demanding that police departments in the state release information about their "arsenals," and also retrain officers in nonviolent communication and anti-oppression, trauma-informed practices — meeting the needs of those with physical and behavioral challenges and strengthening community policing.
