A Facebook page for the event showed more than 480 people planned to participate.Among those in attendance was Deray McKesson, a high-profile activist who was arrested earlier this week in Ferguson, Missouri, where protesters assembled for the one-year anniversary of the police shooting death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown. Singer Janelle Monae was nearby Saturday, holding her own demonstration against police brutality at the U.S. Department of Justice headquarters.#BlackoutDC trended nationally on Twitter as dozens of people posted photos and messages about the protest. Many showed the crowd that assembled outside the Capitol while others relayed the phrases on activists' signs: "Stop racist police terror,” "Black skin is not a sin” and "I'm not a target” were among them. Some users tweeted out phone numbers for legal support should marchers be arrested.#BlackoutDC has made it to the Capitol. #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/IczQ3DI2DG&mdash; Ben Cushing (@bmcushing) August 15, 2015&quot;Hey, hey, ho, ho, these killer cops have got to go.&quot; #BlackoutDC pic.twitter.com/1UdZ5M4DeH&mdash; D (@Delo_Taylor) August 15, 2015#BlackoutDC protest happening right now pic.twitter.com/g64CBbPzaH&mdash; Paulina Leonovich (@Polly_evro) August 15, 2015Black Lives Matter events have picked up over the past week as people across the country remembered Brown, whose 2014 death sparked outcry over what many called institutionalized racism.
