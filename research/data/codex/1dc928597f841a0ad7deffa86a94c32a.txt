"We shouldn't live in fear. All we ask for is equality and peace. ... We're out there to let them know: enough is enough and our lives matter."►Related:Watch footage from Black Lives Matter protest in Detroit"Don't be so quick to point a gun on us," Thomas said. The victims of police shootings this week in Minnesota and Louisiana "are innocent people, not violent," he said.Thomas' views were echoed by others at the rally, which spread through social media with the hashtag #BlackFriday. Some at the rally wore black T-shirts with the phrase "Black Friday" printed in red. Leslie Williams, of Detroit, helped organize the rally and was one of the first speakers. She told the Free Press that the protest was organized after the violence this week involving police in Dallas, Minnesota, and Louisiana that has renewed the national discussion about race and police-community relations.About 9:30 p.m., with the crowd appearing to exceed a thousand people, hundreds began marching south from Campus Martius toward the Detroit River and Hart Plaza chanting, "No justice, no peace.” The crowd was made up of old and young people, black and white. Later they turned north on Woodward and then veered into Greektown and toward the Renaissance Center, horns honking and chanting.Earlier, police kept a watchful eye in the back of the crowd, which was peaceful.Detroit Councilman Mary Sheffield was at the front of the rally at Campus Martius, helping lead the crowds in chants. She and others had T-shirts that read "Occupy the Corner,” referring to a program Sheffield helped organize to improve Detroit neighborhoods.While the impetus for the rally was police abuse, many of the speakers spoke about fighting crime and improving neighborhoods through self-help.Protesters gather at Campus Martius in downtown Detroit on Friday July 8, 2016 while speaking out against recent shootings involving police officers that led to the deaths of Alton Sterling, 37, in Baton Rouge and Philander Castile, 32, in Falcon Heights, Minn. and the shooting of police officers in Dallas, TX.
