Share Share Share By: Matt Johnson, WSB-TV Updated: May 30, 2020 - 5:58 AM ATLANTA ‚Äî Protests over the death of George Floyd took a destructive turn in downtown Atlanta on Friday. The day started out as protesters peacefully marched from Centennial Olympic Park to the state Capitol, and then back. A rally was then held inside the park for a bit, but then things took a turn that ended up with a night of destruction throughout downtown Atlanta, and eventually other parts of the city. Shortly before 5:30 p.m., some type of scuffle happened between a protester and an Atlanta police officer right outside the CNN Center along Centennial Olympic Drive. Content Continues Below [PHOTOS: Protests turn destructive as looters move through downtown Atlanta, Buckhead] Police formed a barricade and kept protesters at bay for quite a while and then protesters took a destructive turn. Shortly after 8 p.m., protesters started smashing the doors of the CNN. Then they moved to parked police cruisers and began jumping on the cars, smashing the windows and eventually set a police cruiser on fire. A short time later, protesters moved along Marietta Street and proceeded to smash windows and deface store fronts and other tourists attractions like the College Football Hall of Fame. Protesters also lit several things on fire, including more police cruisers and parts of the visitor center in Centennial Olympic Park.

While most of the protesters seemed to leave the area, Channel 2 Action News quickly learned that many of them headed to Buckhead, in the area around Lenox Square and Phipps Plaza. The first reports that we were able to confirm that looting had happened was the AT&T store across the street from Lenox Square. Channel 2‚Ä≤s Carol Sbarge arrived at the store around 11:30 p.m. where she found the front door had been smashed out and police had surrounded the business. Around this time, Channel 2 investigative reporter Mark Winne learned from the Georgia National Guard that Gov. Brian Kemp had called them in to help keep the peace around parts of the city. Shortly after Winne reported the news on air, Kemp tweeted out the order. Protester continued to loot businesses across Buckhead throughout the night and the early morning hours of Saturday. Channel 2‚Ä≤s cameras caught several being arrested throughout the evening, but so far, Atlanta police have not released how many people have been taken into custody.

The demonstration began peacefully with protestors marching from Centennial Olympic Park to the Capitol and back. Upon returning to Centennial Olympic Park, the majority of protestors entered into the park while a portion walked south on Centennial Olympic Park Drive where they surrounded an officer inside his patrol vehicle. Additional officers arrived and began to push protestors back away from the vehicle, which led to a number of scuffles between police and protestors and at least three arrests. One officer was pushed to the ground and sustained minor injuries. It does appear pepper spray was utilized several times during the confrontation. Currently, we are attempting to allow the protestors to continue with a peaceful demonstration. Officers have been subjected to water bottles, eggs and other items being thrown at them. However we remain hopeful this activity will cease and there will be no need for further arrests or clashes with protestors.‚Äù 7:33 p.m.: Channel 2‚Ä≤s Jorge Estevez just got done speaking with Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms about the protests unfolding outside the CNN Center in downtown Atlanta.

"It was scary to watch,‚Äù said Jason Ward, a bird watcher here in Atlanta. Ward worked with Christian Cooper, the man shown in a viral video.
