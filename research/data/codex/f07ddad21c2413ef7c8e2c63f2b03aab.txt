Someone has to speak up for us," L.A. resident Channell Temple said.Activists, including some members of the Black Lives Matter group, rallied outside of LAPD headquarters Thursday afternoon before marching nearly half a dozen blocks to Sixth and San Pedro streets. Police stopped traffic along the way, giving the group safe passage.Activists say there are similar protest nationwide Thursday."All over the United States, and this is our 20th year anniversary rise up October against police brutality and murder and the criminalization of a generation," activist Marie Martin said."Absolutely a legitimate problem. Police officers are human. I feel for the police at the same time," L.A. resident Jason Roach said.While most were there to protest in unison, a few were there hoping to express their support for police."Well, I was here to find out why Black Lives Matter thinks that it's OK for criminals in the black community to kill other innocent black people in the community and then go out and kill police officers," Rev. Jesse Peterson said. "If they truly, truly believe that black lives matter, why aren't they protesting the blacks who are killing the blacks?"For the most part, the rally remained peaceful.
