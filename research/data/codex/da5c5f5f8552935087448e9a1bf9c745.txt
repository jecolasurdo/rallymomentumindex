Her family says the 10 hours of footage taken from a surveillance camera inside the restrictive housing unit where Polanco's cell was located shows that Rikers staff failed to provide her with medical care that could have saved her life. Last week, the New York City Department of Investigation, tasked with overseeing city employees and contractors, and the Bronx District Attorney's Office concluded that staff members at Rikers Island's Rose M. Singer Center were not criminally responsible for Polanco's death.
