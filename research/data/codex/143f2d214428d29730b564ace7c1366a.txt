The acrid scent of smoke from burned stores hung in the air. The Benjamin Franklin Bridge was closed indefinitely, and PATCO canceled trains into Philadelphia. All businesses were ordered shuttered ahead of a 6 p.m. Sunday curfew, even as stores in North Philadelphia and West Philadelphia were being looted and police cars vandalized. In the City of Brotherly Love and in metropolises across America, the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis officers has unleashed decades of frustration borne from the mistreatment of African Americans by police authorities. "These are all of our children,” city Register of Wills Tracey Gordon told a crowd that peacefully assembled at City Hall on Sunday. "They deserve to have dignity.

At the South Philadelphia Target where some residents who decided to guard it from looters, groups of black residents showed up after seeing news reports that the South Philly residents had been allowed by police to stay past the city's curfew. As their cars pulled in, the group of white residents stationed at the Target began shouting, asking what they were doing there. Some of the black people who showed up asked why they were protecting the store. Some arguments broke out between the groups. "Why is everybody just protecting this one, and not f—ing protecting everywhere?” one black man shouted. "We live here!” a couple of white men yelled back. Some tried to deescalate the shouting, and police returned to the store and attempted to disperse everyone. The South Philadelphia residents stayed, negotiating with a police officer who asked them to go home for their safety but then said a small group could stay there with some cops. — Tom Gralish Share Shares Facebook Twitter 11:08 PM - May 31, 2020 11:08 PM - 05/31/20 11:08 PM - May 31, 2020 Facebook Twitter Mayor Marty Small declares disaster emergency in Atlantic City A raw-voiced and emotional Atlantic City Mayor Marty Small Sr. took to Facebook live late Sunday night to chastise his city: "It's a damn shame. Everybody should be disappointed. This is hurtful. Today was Atlantic City at its worst. I'm also saying that everyone involved that made this situation escalate should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Today, we worked with the outsiders to trash our city. It was people who live here too. People going to stores in front of police officers taking things that don't belong to them. ... When is this town going to wake up? ... We let it happen. I'm tired of it too. There's a way to go about it. We all felt that pain the last couple weeks with officers killing African American. It hits home. I'm an African American. And it has to stop. But there's a way to do things with decency and order. Do we go around trashing our economy? Hurting Atlantic City? When it's blood spilled in our own streets from people that you know, you don't stand. But you want to ride the national wave when something else happens.” "I'm ashamed. I'm embarrassed. I'm hurt,” Small said. "it's sickening." Small declared a disaster emergency in the city. There will be a 7 p.m. curfew through June 9. —Amy S.

Police were trying to wave people onto the Atlantic City Expressway and out of the city, telling them to disperse or be arrested. Atlantic City Police Chaplain Eric McCoy said he thought most looters were from out of town. "We know most people. We're home grown,” he said. He said he thinks the police killing of George Floyd sparked anger but also tapped into restlessness for some people. "What he did affected the whole country and then you add, number two, you got to understand these people reacted from being sheltered in place. Now they can run outside and they got something to do.

"They were expressing a lot of legitimate concerns about how the police interact in their community and wanted answers,” Gauthier said. She said police were on high alert given the destruction on 52nd Street earlier in the day but the kids wanted to talk, which led to some tension. She tried encouraging the protesters to go home. "I asked them what they wanted that night and they said they wanted to talk to the mayor.” Gauthier, who is serving her first term as a councilmember for West Philadelphia's 3rd District, called the managing director who got Kenney on the phone. Kenney chatted with the protesters for about 10 minutes. "They told him about wanting more investment and resources in their neighborhoods, wanting police to be held accountable and wanting police to engage in their community in a different and and more respectful manner,” Gauthier said. Gauthier said she promised to meet with the protesters along with police captains from the district next Sunday in Malcolm X Park. Shortly after the call, they went home. "Today has been a sad and scary day over all,” Gauthier said. "But for me that was a reminder of just how smart and bright our young people are and we need to invest more in them so that they know how valuable they are.” Gauthier said that after the phone call with Kenney, "most people dispersed” who were protesting on 52nd Street. — Julia Terruso Share Shares Facebook Twitter 9:30 PM - May 31, 2020 9:30 PM - 05/31/20 9:30 PM - May 31, 2020 Facebook Twitter Standing guard in front of South Philly Target, residents allowed to stay past city curfew TOM GRALISH / Staff Photographer Residents living around the Target on Mifflin Street in South Philadelphia gathered in front of the store.

But at the South Philadelphia Target, the evening was "very peaceful,” said one of the men gathered outside, who identified himself as Johnny B. "I saw the first group of you guys pull up...

Peaceful protests over the police involved death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week gave way to violence and vandalism Saturday in Philadelphia and across the country. As Jabari Jones, president of the West Philadelphia Corridor Collaborative, the neighborhood's largest coalition of small businesses, walked down 52nd Street on Sunday afternoon, he was devastated as he saw destruction at locally owned businesses in the neighborhood he and many others have worked to grow and support. He believed some were "taking advantage of the crisis and chaos” set off by George Floyd's death "to go breaking into” stores. What he saw on a street that's the heartbeat of his community — where windows were smashed, shops were looted, and Jones heard of people throwing bricks at stores — was "really tragic,” he said. "Seeing decades of investment, of community planning, of support from grantmaking agencies, and seeing so much of that great work literally be thrown away in the course of an afternoon is really devastating,” Jones said. Almost all the businesses on 52nd Street are small or locally owned, and about half are black-owned, some for multiple generations, he said. His organization estimates that about 5% of the street's businesses are franchises or chains. "Businesses are already... driven to this point of making the decision of whether they're going to shut down for good because of the coronavirus. And now this might be the straw that breaks a lot of camels' backs in terms of businesses saying, 'Look, I can't reopen,'” Jones said. West Philadelphia Corridor Collaborative will tour the street tomorrow to assess the damage. They plan to send businesses insurance-claim guidance and push the city and state government to help the area recover from destruction the businesses "are not responsible for.” But it could be a hard road ahead. "We need city, state and federal or otherwise resources to help us rebuild those community corridors,” Jones said. "Because those businesses are already struggling because of coronavirus, and if we don't get some kind of support or aid to them, we're going to have a vastly different neighborhood on 52nd Street.” — Justine McDaniel Share Shares Facebook Twitter 8:20 PM - May 31, 2020 8:20 PM - 05/31/20 8:20 PM - May 31, 2020 Facebook Twitter Biden surveys damage after Wilmington protest, takes photos with residents Former Vice President Joe Biden walked down Market Street in downtown Wilmington on Sunday, according to videos and photos posted on his Instagram account.

ALVAREZ / Staff Photographer A vandal repeatedly threw rocks at the front of the Wells Fargo on Walnut St in the Rittenhouse square area on Saturday. A day after looters ransacked stores in Center City's commercial corridors for hours before officers responded to break up the scene, city officials said Sunday that the delay in response was more an issue of manpower than a lack of will. City Managing Director Brian Abernathy described a chaotic scene with responding to vandalism, arson and some 3,000 to 4,000 people around City Hall, delaying officers' ability to move to other parts of the city's downtown area Saturday. "They were not able to get to Walnut Street as quickly as we would have like them to,” he said, adding, "But by no means did officers lay down or allow illegal activity to happen,” Abernathy said. "But I'm not going to allow our officers ... to put themselves at risk when they're outnumbered 10 to 1.” Even as Abernathy was speaking at a Sunday evening news conference, more looting and unrest gripped other neighborhoods across the city, including the area around Kensington and Allegheny Avenues and the 52nd Street commercial corridor in West Philadelphia. As of 6 p.m., police had made at least 10 additional arrests and cited 13 others for failure to disperse. Four police cars set ablaze and at least five officers were injured at 52nd and Market Streets by people throwing bricks, rocks and Molotov cocktails. Authorities sought to break up the unrest by firing gas canisters from armored vehicles at the crowds. Authorities described the majority of looters as locals "hurting their neighbors” as they urged an end to the unrest. Though he said officers were able to respond more swiftly to those trouble spots Sunday, Abernathy acknowledged similar manpower issues in dealing with those more diffused pockets of tension. He expressed hope that an influx of Pennsylvania national guardsman will help alleviate deployment shortages. "Just like last night, there are more looters than there are police officers,” he said. "But we certainly haven't and we won't abandon any of our commercial corridors.” — Jeremy Roebuck and Allison Steele Share Shares Facebook Twitter 7:15 PM - May 31, 2020 7:15 PM - 05/31/20 7:15 PM - May 31, 2020 Facebook Twitter Atlantic City sets 8 p.m. curfew Amy Rosenberg / Staff Police stand outside Timberland Outlet in Atlantic City, where windows were smashed on Sunday.

The day after demonstrations and destruction in Center City, the focus Sunday evening instead was on West Philadelphia: As the city's 6 p.m. curfew passed, the neighborhood — where police cars were smashed and looting began Sunday afternoon — became a hot spot, with police and people gathering there. Police shot a gas onto 52nd Street just before 7 p.m., about an hour after they first sprayed gas at people on the street. Looters ran in and out of stores and ransacked a strip mall. People gathered in front of a police barricade at 52nd and Walnut, their eyes on an armored truck farther down the street as they passed out half-gallons of milk and shouted. A street medic on 52nd Street told a reporter she had treated two women for wounds from rubber bullets and a few men for cuts and scrapes. She was walking down the street asking anyone if they needed hand sanitizer or medical help. Michelle Rifken, 41, who has lived in the neighborhood for 20 years, said she believed the police's presence had provoked the unrest she's seen today. She had been pepper sprayed three times on Market Street earlier in the day, she said, and she said cops were firing rubber bullets. "It was completely safe this morning, it was beautiful, it was peaceful. They came here, they're a lightning rod for people's anger. Seeing my neighborhood occupied by a militaristic police force?

No ballots were affected during the protests and there has so far been no impact on how Tuesday's election will be run, said Nick Custodio, deputy city commissioner under Lisa Deeley, the chair of the city commissioners, who run elections. On Saturday, as protesters broke windows, set fire to cars, and tussled with police outside City Hall, the commissioners sent their staffers inside either home or to their other office at Delaware Avenue and Spring Garden Street. They also moved upward of 30,000 or so ballots from City Hall — where mail ballots are sent — to that satellite office, where much of the logistical work of running elections takes place normally anyway. About 20,000 of the ballots were moved Sunday morning and delivery of incoming ballots has been diverted from City Hall. A monitored mail ballot drop box at the south portal of City Hall remains in place, Custodio said, and the ballots inside were collected as staffers relocated.

Mayor Jim Kenney said Sunday that the Frank Rizzo statue in front of the Municipal Services Building — which became a central target of Saturday's protests — would be moved from the plaza "hopefully by another month or so.” The debate over moving the statue of the controversial former mayor and police commissioner has lasted for years. Kenney said he has "never liked” the statue, but that it has been difficult to move because it is bolted into stairs that are above a concourse used by people every day. Kenney had first promised to move the statue in 2017. He said Sunday: "We're going to accelerate its movement.” "I can't wait to see it go away,” the mayor said. The statue — which was vandalized during Saturday's demonstration as protesters sought to pull it down — was clean again by Sunday morning. Kenney said the cleaning was part of a broader effort to restore the area around City Hall, where there was additional vandalism and cars were burned during Saturday's demonstrations." It got cleaned with everything else that got cleaned,” Kenney said. "There was no intention of cleaning up for any particular political reason or any special reason.” — Chris Palmer Share Shares Facebook Twitter 1:01 PM - May 31, 2020 1:01 PM - 05/31/20 1:01 PM - May 31, 2020 Facebook Twitter Restricted access announced for Center City MONICA HERNDON / Staff Photographer Philly Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw spoke during a press conference the day after protests related to the killing of George Floyd, outside of the Fire Administration Building in Philadelphia, Pa. on Sunday, May 31, 2020. The Police Commissioner announced that the National Guard had been called, and that access into Center City was being restricted. Philadelphia Police will limit access to Center City on Sunday, closing down roads and other access points in an attempt to stave off violence that accompanied protests on Saturday. Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw said at a news conference that officers would begin diverting most people away from Center City between South and Vine Streets and the Schuylkill and Delaware Rivers as early as Sunday afternoon. Business owners and residents will still be allowed to come and go, she said, but others would be turned back. A citywide curfew also will begin at 8 p.m. for the second night in a row. The measures come as volunteers spent the morning cleaning up the damage left behind after a series of peaceful protests on Saturday, at which demonstrators decried the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota, grew chaotic and violent later in the afternoon.

As a Philadelphia police officer remains hospitalized from a hit-and-run incident, the head of Philly's police union issued a stern warning Sunday that assaulting a cop, vandalism, and looting "will not be tolerated.” Thirteen officers were injured during the demonstration, said Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw. Of the 140 arrested, two were for assaulting a police officer, according to the police department. FOP Lodge 5 President John McNesby said in a statement that officers showed "incredible restraint, bravery and courage” during Saturday's demonstrations. "While our officers were literally in the line of fire attempting to keep the city safe, several Philadelphia politicians were running to get themselves on television and many never acknowledged the sacrifice and dangerous conditions these officers faced,” McNesby said in a statement.

The flagship store, which is located at 16th and Sansom Streets, where a majority of the violence and looting was focused Saturday night, was unrecognizable beyond its sign out front. The parts of the floor that weren't covered in glass and strewed about clothing were flooded with water after the fire sprinklers were triggered by the smoke and vandalism.

Near City Hall, the Frank Rizzo statue, which had been vandalized and attempted to be burned, was cleaned. Around the corner, the Ben Franklin statue remained defaced.
