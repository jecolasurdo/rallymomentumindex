An arbitrator ruled Monday that Euclid Mayor Kirsten Holzheimer Gail did not have cause to fire Amiott.But protestors at the rally blamed the city of Euclid, rather than the arbitrator, for Amiott's return to duty."We are tired of hearing that it is the arbitrator's fault that someone gets hired back, when in reality the city council and the mayor have the authority and the power to implement charges against a rogue police officer," said Cassandra McDonald, the president of the Euclid NAACP branch.McDonald, activists from Peace In The Hood and Black on Black Crime, and other protestors called on Euclid officials to again fire Amiott, and charge him with a crime in connection with the violent arrest.Ryan Midday, a spokesman for Cuyahoga County Prosecutor Michael O'Malley, told cleveland.com last month that a criminal investigation is ongoing.The independent arbitrator's ruling calls for Amiott to be reinstated within two weeks. Gail said Monday that she disagreed with the arbitrator, but that she will follow through with his decision.The Euclid NAACP responded by issuing a travel advisory, warning African-Americans not to travel through Euclid.McDonald said during Tuesday's rally that complaints and concerns against officers should be taken seriously."What I would hope to see is that somewhere along the line the chief of police and officers say 'we did mess up along the line and there is room for us to improve,'" she said. "When they can reach that point, it'll be better. Right now, it's a push-and-pull of power. It's not about power."Protestors also advocated for the firing of another Euclid police officer, James Aoki, named last week in a civil lawsuit filed by a woman who accuses Aoki of assaulting her.Shajuan Gray's suit accuses Aoki of forcing his way into her apartment and assaulting her. The suit says Aoki pushed Gray against a freezer and exposed her breasts to the officer and neighbors.Gray, who filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court Northern District of Ohio, is seeking an unknown amount of damages.One of the protesters at Tuesday's rally, Troy Harris, said he feels it's dismaying to see officers escape punishment in use-of-force incidents."We're not against police," he said. "We're not against the justice system, but what we are against are these thugs that's hiding behind police badges. That's a problem. That's an issue. ... Michael Amiott is a stain in this community. A stain that can't be removed unless he's out of here."Harris also brought up a Euclid police officer's fatal shooting of Luke Stewart. A Cuyahoga County grand jury declined to bring criminal charges against Matthew Rhodes, the officer who fatally shot Stewart on March 13, 2017.Amiott had been disciplined before for losing his temper, losing evidence and hitting a suspect with his gun, according to records in his personnel file. The Mentor Police Department allowed Amiott to resign in 2014 after he conducted a traffic stop without probable cause and lied about it, records show.Watch the full protest below.
