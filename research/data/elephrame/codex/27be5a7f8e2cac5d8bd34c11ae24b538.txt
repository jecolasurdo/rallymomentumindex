Griffin ended up winning 30-0.Hours earlier, that outcome was in serious doubt.FSU's Mara Green kneels again for anthem, tells whyStanley told the Tallahassee Democrat that Griffin principal Gwendolyn Thomas threatened to cancel the contest if he continued his protest.The dispute began a week ago before Griffin's game against Raa Middle School, where Stanley said he and a few players took a knee during the anthem. That apparently caught the attention of Thomas, who did not return a call from the Democrat.After last Tuesday's protest, Stanley said he had to cancel football practice — something he's never done before — to have a meeting with Thomas about the protest."She said she just wanted to talk to us, but you can talk to us outside of practice hours," he said.A compromise emerged when Stanley was told he could protest off the field."At this point, I don't want to take away from the kids," Stanley said hours before the game. "But I don't want to give up my rights, you know. She said I'd have to go behind the stands if we're going to protest. We're planning on playing tonight. We know there's going to be a lot of people there to see what's going to happen. I'm not sure if we're going to take a knee yet. I haven't talked to the coaching staff."Ricky Bell, who oversees athletics for the school district, said before the game that he had a conversation with Thomas. She told him she wanted to give coaches an opportunity to meet with their players before games. The team meeting would be in the locker room, away from the field, as per school protocol."If he wanted to take a knee then, that would be fine," Bell said.If Stanley took his protest to the field, he would have been found insubordinate. And if Stanley ended up doing something that qualified as insubordination, i.e. leaving his team behind the bleachers to protest on the field, the second-year coach could have been dismissed from the team. He said Stanley is supposed to be with his team during the anthem, and the team is supposed to be away from the field. The insubordination would stem from Stanley leaving his players unsupervised, not from the protest, Bell said."We're not saying anything is right or wrong,” Bell said after the game. "He could have taken them to the locker room. Most high school teams do that. College teams do that. That's why we try to do that. Whatever they do in the locker room, that's between them and their players."Colin Kaepernick on receiving death threats: Violence would prove my pointBell added that the outcome was good and "all's well that ends well.""He's fine," Bell said of Coach Stanley. "I congratulated them after the game. They had a great game, they were all upbeat after the game was over. I shook everyone's hand and said, 'Let's do it again next week.'”Stanley is not the first athletic figure in Tallahassee to join the national protest, which was sparked by NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick. Last week, FSU volleyball player Mara Green knelt before the Seminoles' game against Florida, saying she was, "unhappy with the racial tension, racial injustice and police brutality in our country.”"At the end of the day, my job is to coach and mentor these kids to be the best they can be,” Stanley said. "I want them to be successful on and off the field.”Letter: Stop covering national anthem protestorsStaff Directory Corrections Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Public Notices Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My AccountSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJob Network Cars.com Tallahassee Homes Classifieds Education Moonlighting Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2020 www.tallahassee.com.
