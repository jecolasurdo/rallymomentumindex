I'm wondering why you're piggybacking off Kathleen Wynne,” the speaker said, attacking the fact that Tory did not meet with BLMTO publicly before this event. "You are a coward.”"I'm here tonight because I was invited by (Wynne) and the provincial government,” Tory said after taking the mic, visibly upset. He said there would be further meetings and quickly sat down.Earlier in the night, Wynne addressed the issue of white privilege and marginalized experiences directly with members of the audience who yelled at her regarding accountability."I believe we can do better. I believe there are people who would like to see us go at each other's throats,” Wynne said, asking for civility and understanding from all sides. "I don't believe we have to do that. I believe that we can find a better way.”Children and Youth Services Minister Michael Coteau, who is also in charge of the province's anti-racism efforts, answered questions about how much money was being spent on the new anti-racism task force. He explained that it was $5 million — a number criticized as being "peanuts” by the audience — but that the goal was to leverage other ministers to join the effort.Sheron Shadrach drove nearly two hours from Mississauga to attend the meeting tonight. When she found out she had to watch in an overflow area, she said she felt disrespected. The organizers should have predicted there would be more interest and found a venue that could accommodate more than 300 people, she said.Her friend Audrey Campbell said the people in Daniels Spectrum were being treated like "caged rats.” At least 200 people filled the two overflow areas, some spilling onto the patio outdoors to listen in the rain.Before the meeting got started, audience members reflected on what they hoped to see and hear from politicians in attendance.Margaret Parsons, executive director of the African Canadian Legal Clinic, said she was hoping for a concrete action plan to address and eliminate racism. Emile Thomas, another attendee, said he was concerned Tory was "piggybacking” onto the meeting organized between the provincial government and Black Lives Matter. Tory hadn't agreed to a public meeting at the municipal level with Black Lives Matter activists.The meeting follows months of protest from Black Lives Matter against Toronto police over allegations of discrimination and aggressive policing, with carding and police shooting incidents as cornerstones of the debate.Get more of what matters in your inboxStart your morning with everything you need to know, and nothing you don't.
