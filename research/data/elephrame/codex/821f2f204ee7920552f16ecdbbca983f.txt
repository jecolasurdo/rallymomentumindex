(Steve Schering/Pioneer Press) Hundreds of Oak Park middle and high school students left their classrooms Tuesday morning to march against violence and inequality on the seventh anniversary of the shooting death of Florida teenager Trayvon Martin. It began shortly after 10 a.m. as a large group of Oak Park and River Forest High School students walked out of classes to march to Oak Park Village Hall and the police station. Along the way, the group was joined by students from Percy Julian Middle School, who were waiting at the corner of Ridgeland Avenue and Washington Boulevard. Advertisement Students said the march was organized to protest police brutality, violence and inequality, with the group chanting "No justice, no peace, no racist police,” "Hands up, don't shoot,” "Black lives Matter,” and "Enough is enough,” throughout their trek. Upon reaching village hall, the students shared stories about their personal encounters with racism, and called on Oak Park District 97 and OPRF High School District 200 leaders to create policies to protect students of color.

"We're calling on our schools to make the needed changes to show that they care.” [Most read] Coronavirus in Illinois updates: 44 more deaths reported as COVID-19 continues to impact Black people at greater rate; Chicago says restaurants can open for indoor dining next Friday » OPRF student Antoine Ford, who organized the march, spoke to the group through a megaphone inside the village hall courtyard. "As students of color, we are all Trayvon,” Ford said. "True change has been denied because those in charge are uncomfortable. We are tired. Black lives matter.” Middle and high school students meet with Oak Park District 97 administrators in front of Julian Middle School after walking out of classes Tuesday morning to protest violence. (Steve Schering/Pioneer Press) Following the march, Ford said he and other students of color wanted to share their stories of what they deal with each and every day, while bringing awareness to the greater community. "It was to bring awareness to all the lives that have been taken,” Ford said. "It's how we felt, in a peaceful way, that we wanted to express ourselves. Being black or brown students, we wanted to bring awareness and have police be aware how they are treating us.” Parent Makesha Flournoy was one of several adults handing out bottled water and snacks to the students, who braved the cold weather to make their voices heard.

"We expect that from our schools and our village. Our kids are being traumatized by the words and actions of their peers and adults.” After gathering for more than 20 minutes in the village hall's outdoor courtyard, students attempted to enter the police station in the building's basement. After allowing several students downstairs, Oak Park police blocked the stairwell citing safety concerns, and directed students to village hall's main level. "I support what you are doing,” Oak Park Police Chief LaDon Reynolds told students. "We can't be disruptive because people are conducting business.” Students left the building at about 11:30 a.m., and they went straight to Julian Middle School, where the protest continued at the school's front entrance.

Advertisement After several minutes, community activist and OPRF teacher Anthony Clark calmed the group, saying Fitzgerald and Oak Park District 97 Superintendent Carol Kelley would address the crowd. "Understand why you're here,” Clark said through a megaphone. "Sometimes, we talk. Sometimes, we listen.” Several students held their fists in the air as Fitzgerald addressed the situation. "After sitting with students for a meeting, I shared with them that I didn't feel comfortable having a re-enactment of this event, a young boy being murdered, in our middle school,” Fitzgerald said. "In sharing that with the social justice club, we then had some conversations around some other options. What's [happened] over the last couple of days, there was the fact this walkout was being put together. I did talk to members about how if [the proposed demonstration] was something to happen at a high school, maybe the conversation would be a little different because we'd be dealing with kids that are freshmen through seniors as opposed to sixth-, seventh- and eighth-graders. My intent is not to hinder your voice. I will continue to support all of you moving forward and support your efforts, especially when it comes to having your voice heard and expressing yourself.” Students protesting violence walk past the Oak Park District 97 administration building at 260 Madison St. after walking out of classes on Tuesday morning. (Steve Schering/Pioneer Press) Ford said he felt students were not being heard by school leaders, adding an idea to gather parent permission slips to host the event was not taken seriously by administrators. Fitzgerald said he felt the permission slips were not feasible as the student's re-enactment wishes necessitated a "quick turnaround,” but said he is committed to hearing out the Julian students. "There are going to be times where we don't always agree on what we should do here at the school,” Fitzgerald said. "Not everybody's going to see eye-to-eye. We're going to have to continue these conversations to arrive at solutions for our students.” Ford said it is his hope the schools will host a day of remembrance each year to honor those lost to racial violence, as well as provide opportunities for students of color to be heard. After listening to Fitzgerald and District 97 leaders, Julian Middle School students returned to classes at about 12:30 p.m., while the OPRF High School students began walking back to their campus.

"They have a right to peacefully protest. Our goal is to ensure that they are kept safe in the process. Administrators and security staff will be monitoring hallways, exits and the outside of the campus to ensure that students remain safe and peaceful.” The walkout came four days after about 100 OPRF students took part in what district officials said was a "peaceful protest” outside of Pruitt-Adams' office during the school's third-period classes. According to Pruitt-Adams, the students were holding signs protesting the treatment of black students. Those students "sat silently and peacefully against the walls of the hallway,” and dispersed shortly after fourth period began, officials said. Shortly after Pruit-Adams sent her letter to parents on Monday, OPRF announced its board of education would host a town hall on racial equity and school safety, which is scheduled to take place at 6:30 p.m. March 7 inside the school's south cafeteria, 201 N. Scoville Ave. However, school officials stated that the March 7 event has been postponed.
