Murders like that of Sandra Bland in Texas, instances of non lethal police violence like the multiple shots fired at Tyshara Blouin here in New Orleans by JPSO, and the continued silence around state violence and Black women face have led to a call for this day of action for the 2nd year in a row. This year, join us in Congo Square in celebration, conversation, and commemoration for in and support of Black women, girls, and femmes. We'll be opening space for speakers, singing and chants, altar creation, and lifting up the voices & prismatic experiences of Black femmes, women, and girls who are or have been incarcerated; who are mothers, parents, adult supporters, caretakers; who are in lesbian, gay, queer, bisexual, asexual, and/or pansexual communities; who are transgender, genderfluid, gender non-conforming, and/or agender; who are poor; who are undocumented; who have disabilities of any & all kind; who are adults, youth, or elders; who are ancestors and who are community leaders; and so much more.Black women, girls, and femmes: take space; allies: make space.Nationally, folks will be engaging in actions, celebrations, healing spaces, and more that center the lives, experiences, and legacies of our Black girls, femmes, and women. Join us in Congo Square and always make sure to #SayHerName—The national #SayHerName Day of Action was started last year when BYP100 - Chicago made a call to uplift the story of Rekia Boyd and the countless other Black women and girls who have been killed by state violence, then had their narratives erased from the #BlackLivesMatter movement by mainstream sources and at times, organizers themselves. The #SayHerName day of action is a call to center the particular ways state violence intersects with gender and race when it comes to Black women, girls and femmes. Last year, the New Orleans chapter of BYP100 along with a dozen other local organizations held a rally and vigil at the site of Penny Proud's murder along Clairborne Ave and demanded we #SayHerName and the names of other Black women and girls we have lost to state and structural violence. Join us this year for a Celebration, Conversation and Commemoration of Black women, girls, and femmes.#SayHerName #BlackLivesMatter– Black Youth Project 100 (BYP100) is an activist member-based organization of Black 18-35 year olds, dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all Black people. We do our work through a Black queer feminist lens. www.byp100.orgBYP100 - NOLA Chapter@BYP_100 #SayHerName #SayHerName2016 #05.19.16 #NOLA #NewOrleans #LA #BlackLivesMatter #BlackGirlsMatter #BlackWomenMatter #BYP100
