She's angry at the police shootings involving black men in Rockford and beyond. She's angry at the mass shootings across the country.Today, Smith along with other community members voiced their frustrations and their passions at a Black Lives Matter demonstration in Beattie Park downtown. More than 100 people attended and several of them took to the center of the large crowd to speak on the state of racial tension and racial violence in the country."We're in the same position we were when my grandmother marched with Martin Luther King, Jr.," said Smith.A Black Lives Matter Unity Peace Walk will also take place Sunday.Black Lives Matter protests have popped up across the country as a response to the onslaught of racial tension and violence. This particular event was put together as a response to the black men shot by police in Louisiana and Minnesota, and was attended by people of different races, religion and backgrounds for a unified message."This cannot be a standalone event," said Dylan Garcia, a Rockford resident and organizer of the event. "Police violence will not end tomorrow, and these events cannot end today."A GoFundMe page helped pay for the cost of a special use permit and insurance that came to about $200 issued by the Rockford Park District, Garcia said.Though the protest was a peaceful one — with speeches, spoken words, signs and more — a Rockford Police presence was established across the park and mostly out of sight as a precaution; some Black Lives Matter protests around the country have turned violent.Stanley Campbell, a Rockford resident who attended after seeing the event on Facebook, said he was surprised at the diversity at the event."I thought it would be mostly African Americans," he said, "but we got everybody here."He said the gathering was "beautiful" and "very moving" because people were allowed to share their thoughts."I wish the city (officials) could hear this to change their heart," he said. "This city is torn apart by racism."Adam Poulisse: 815-987-1344; apoulisse@rrstar.com; @adampoulisseIf you goWhat: Black Lives Matter Unity Peace WalkWhen: 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. SundayWhere: Beattie Park, 401 N.
