Nemecek said she is the mother of a police officer and when she watched the video of Minneapolis man George Floyd being killed, with now former officer Derek Chauvin's knee on Floyd's throat for more than 8 minutes, she became paralyzed with emotion. She read a poem expressing her sorrow, pain and horror. "He, like so many others, didn't have to die,” she said. "My job, as the mother of a police officer, is simple: to teach ya'll empathy. Empathy will bring about the highest standards of humanity, and that is what will bring about unity, and unity will bring about change.” Nemecek was the first speaker at the peaceful Black Lives Matter protest in Amsterdam on Sunday, which included about 300 protesters, and was coordinated with the Amsterdam Police Department and the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office. No speakers expressed enmity toward local police, although criticism of systemic racism in law enforcement broadly was clear from many of the signs held up by protesters, including one that said "No more bad apples.”Nemecek said the protest, one of many in the Capital Region and throughout the United States, must reach the hearts of all law enforcement personnel, and of all Americans. "No, not every police officer is bad, however, every police officer should garner the emotions of those who are protesting,” she said. "In order to achieve equality, we must first become one. [To do that] we must feel the emotions of another's suffering.” AllBlack Lives Matter ProtestR FPBlackLivesMatter14Sisters Emma and Katie Trahan participate in Sunday's Black Lives Matter protest in Haslett Park, Fort Plain.

New Amsterdam Police Chief John "JJ” Thomas and Montgomery County Sheriff Jeff Smith both spoke and interacted with protesters throughout the approximately 2-hour event, which stretched from the Amsterdam Free Library around Guy Park Avenue in front of the Public Safety Building. Neither, however, gave speeches. One of the protest organizers was Nydia Hill. Hill told the protesters that she offered to allow the police to speak, but they declined telling her that the event should be about the views of the protesters. Amsterdam Police Chief John "JJ” Thomas said law enforcement was there to keep the peace and to listen. He also praised Hill. "I've known Nydia my whole career, and she's a wonderful woman, and I knew we wouldn't have an issue today,” he said. Some peaceful protests around the U.S. have included varying degrees of participation by local law enforcement. During a protest in Schenectady on May 31, after a sometimes tense standoff between some aggressive protesters and police behind barricades, Chief Eric Clifford conducted a public dialog with peaceful protest leaders about race relations, racial minority recruitment and the injustice of the death of George Floyd. Clifford then took a knee in solidarity with the protesters, and several Schenectady Police officers walked with them around the block. On Sunday in Amsterdam, the protest was attended by some elected officials including Mayor Michael Cinquanti, Montgomery County Executive Matt Ossenfort and District 9 Legislator Robert Purtell, but only Cinquanti spoke. "I'm here in a dual role,” Cinquanti said. "I'm here to join you in your protest. The death of George Floyd disgusted me. More importantly, as mayor — I have a police department — and that police department, everyone of them I spoke to was just as disgusted as I was.” Cinquanti took a knee with protesters at the conclusion of the protest. He said last week he intends to review the police "Use of Force” policy with the new police chief, something former President Barack Obama has suggested mayors and police departments do throughout the U.S. Thomas said Amsterdam does not permit choke holds during arrests. "We do follow state and federal guidelines, but everything will be reviewed,” Thomas said. "We don't do choke holds. We don't do anything with knees to the neck. We don't do anything that cuts off circulation. That's something that's not trained at all. Officers are instructed to only use trained techniques that they learn in the academy, or in defensive tactic instruction.” Thomas said he's been a part of the Amsterdam Police Department since 1998. "When we go out, we've got to do the job right each and every time,” he said. "Racism has no place in the police department, or society.” During the protest several speakers, including Hill, said they'd been arrested over the course of their lives, and had at times been treated unfairly by police, but not by the Amsterdam Police Department or the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office. Hill set the tone for how she wanted protesters to conduct themselves. "We don't want no negativity here today,” she said. "We want the world to know that we can do this in peace. We don't have to loot, and we don't have to misbehave.” COVID-19 Coverage The Amsterdam Recorder is committed to keeping our community safe and informed and is offering our COVID-19 coverage to you free.

One protester, who seemed to be helping to organize where protesters would stand, was Chris Town, a 2015 graduate of Gloversville High School. Town said he was inspired by the three silent protests in Fulton County organized by Gloversville resident Lashawn Hawkins to help ensure protests in Fulton and Montgomery counties remain peaceful. Hawkins spoke briefly at the protest. She said a change is coming to American, and she intends to bring her silent style of protest to more local areas, possibly to Fort Plain. "Peacefully, but we comin' though,” she said. "I don't want to single out Fort Plain, because we're going everywhere, because it's needed. If it wasn't needed, we wouldn't be out here, but we're going to do it peaceful. We're going to do it respectful. We're not going to burn anything down, because, at the end of the day, we've got to live here.” Hawkins said law enforcement works for the people, and all members of the public must feel free to go to them and speak about their concerns. "And we'll listen,” Montgomery County Sheriff Jeff Smith said. "And if they don't, call me, and I'll go with you, and then they'll really listen,” she said. "And then we'll listen again,” Smith said. Ossenfort said he's glad the protest was conducted peacefully. "People need to be able to speak their minds, and the sheriffs and police helped to take care of that,” he said. "Montgomery County is a wonderful place, with a lot of great people who are very tolerant of each other. We aren't the most diverse county in the world, but, especially in Amsterdam, people are close, no matter what color they are. People here are friendly, and it's events like this that help us move forward.” A panoramic view of the event.Adam Shinder/Staff Writer Hill and Hawkins lead protesters at the event.
