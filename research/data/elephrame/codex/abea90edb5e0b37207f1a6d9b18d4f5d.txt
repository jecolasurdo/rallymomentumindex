Near the end of his enthusiastically received set -- which included "Freedom" and his features on Daft Punk's "Get Lucky" and Robin Thicke's "Blurred Lines" -- Pharrell Williams, who hails from Virginia Beach, took a swipe at the president's inflammatory remarks about NFL players who kneel or sit in protest during the playing of the National Anthem. Genuflecting before the wildly cheering crowd, Williams said, "If I want to get on my knees right now for the people of my city, for the people of my state, that's what this flag is for," a reference to the Stars and Stripes. He never mentioned Trump. Williams and The Roots, who backed him, then launched into "Happy," which Pharrell said was how he felt about performing in his home state.
