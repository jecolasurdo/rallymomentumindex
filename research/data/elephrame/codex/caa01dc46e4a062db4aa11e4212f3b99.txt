Ryan O'Neill in the parking lot of the Central High Apartments. While responding to a call for someone breaking into vehicles, O'Neill confronted Logan, who reportedly had a knife. O'Neill shot Logan when he went toward the police officer, officials have said. "I'm mad because my brother died,” Tyree Bonds, brother of Eric, said in the middle of the loud, intense dialogue. "People are getting tired of you letting your officers do whatever they want to do.”Shirley Newbill, Eric's mother, asked Buttigieg and the city to act on her son's death."I have been here all my life, and you have not done a damn thing about me or my son or none of these people out here,” she said. "It's time for you to do something.”At one point, a woman at the rally told Buttigieg," You're running for president and you want black people to vote for you? That's not going to happen."Watch: Scenes from the Eric Logan march Video: Watch: Scenes from the Eric Logan march A member of the group read a list of demands to Buttigieg, calling for O'Neill to be fired and for a review of the case by the U.S. Department of Justice. It also called for the resignation of Ruszkowski, body camera policy changes, new training and other changes.The mayor said he would sent a letter to the Department of Justice to explain the case and its effects on South Bend. When handed a petition and asked if he would sign it calling for a federal investigation, Buttigieg declined to because of its wording, but he offered to consider one with proper revisions. "The only thing you are going to get answers (for,) is to show the chief and show the mayor your frustration, show them your pain,” Eli Cantu said. "Whenever we have meetings, let's show up. Let's show up every week. That's how change is going to come.”Each speaker relayed their experiences with the police department, and many talked of fear when interacting with police in the community."When we get pulled over, do we run or do we stay?” one woman asked. "Do we grab our IDs or do you wait until you all just kill us, too? It's scary. Do you understand we are here today because we are scared?”Buttigieg said the department had instituted civil rights and other training, worked on the safety board minority representation and put forth body cameras, and he acknowledged that it has not been enough."This isn't enough, and I get it,” he said. "We set up body cameras, right? And they failed us when we needed them. If you are saying it's not good enough, you're right.”As the group assembled Friday, chants of "No justice, no peace,” became "No justice, no peace, no racist police.”The main group marched from police headquarters to the County-City Building. Another smaller group, made up of Buttigieg, Logan's family members and others, marched as well before Buttigieg and Ruszkowski spoke there for about 15 minutes.As it stands, there is no word whether St. Joseph County Prosecutor Ken Cotter will ask for a special prosecutor to handle the police shooting investigation. Local faith leaders, community organizers and members of the Common Council have called for an independent prosecutor to oversee the case.Also, the mayor's office on Tuesday announced that the police chief had issued a new order that "officers should activate their body cameras during all work-related interactions with civilians.” Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save +17 Photos Photos: March for Eric Logan Jun 21, 2019 Tags Pete Buttigieg South Bend Shooting Eric Logan Mayor Pete South Bend Mayor Police Greg Swiercz Author email Follow Greg Swiercz Newsletters Success!
