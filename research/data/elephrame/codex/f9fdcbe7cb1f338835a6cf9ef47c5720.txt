FRAMINGHAM – When he first moved to Framingham from Puerto Rico, Kelvin Rivera remembers being pulled over by a police officer after he failed to come to a full stop at a stop sign.Sixteen years old, he panicked and got out of the car. The officer told him to get on the ground immediately."I know that wasn't the right thing to do," said Rivera, now 22. "But my heart was racing, I was scared. I think after that, I just had a different point of view."Rivera and about 30 other Framingham High School graduates were on city streets Thursday afternoon protesting police violence in the wake of George Floyd's death in Minnesota. Wearing masks, they spread out across sidewalks, hoisting signs reading "Black Lives Matter" in the air.Floyd, a black man, was handcuffed and died in police custody on Monday. A bystander's video showed the man pleading that he could not breathe as Derek Chauvin, a white police officer, pressed his knee into his neck.Minneapolis police identified the other officers as Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng.All four officers involved in the arrest were fired Tuesday, hours after the video went viral. The death is also under investigation by the FBI and state law enforcement authorities. It immediately drew comparisons to the case of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man who died in 2014 in New York after he was placed in a chokehold by police and pleaded for his life, saying he could not breathe. Chauvin was arrested Friday afternoon and charged with third degree murder and manslaughter.On Friday, Framingham Mayor Yvonne Spicer called Floyd "somebody's son, brother, cousin, uncle -- a human being...that deserved better from those sworn to protect and serve.""We need to demand justice be served. I am urging all of us that believe we all should have the right to breathe, to occupy space, to fight back. I particularly need my white allies to amplify your voice, and use your privilege to change a system that does not work for all," said Spicer in a statement.The Massachusetts Chiefs of Police Association, representing police chiefs in all Massachusetts cities and towns and most college campuses, also released a statement Friday denouncing "the egregious actions taken by four members of the Minneapolis Police Department, whether by action or inaction, that resulted in the death of George Floyd."Standing on Worcester Road near Shoppers World, Allyson Rodriguez, 22, said she wanted to use her "own privilege to call attention to the injustice going on.""It's difficult to have someone's death broadcast in that way," said Rodriguez.Sierra Estes, 22, held up a sign that read, "Say their names," with a list of about 24 victims in police shootings and other acts of violence. Some are well-known, she said, such as Trayvon Martin or Tamir Rice, while other names she had never heard of before."With 'Say their names,' we're basically saying, 'We're not going to forget you. You were here. You mattered,'" Estes said.Rivera said he posted about his plan to protest on a Facebook group for the Class of 2016 on Wednesday. His former classmates quickly joined him. The group was out again Friday afternoon, kneeling for nine minutes outside the Memorial Building."I couldn't stay quiet," said Rivera.Material from The Associated Press was used in this report.Zane Razzaq writes about education.
