Speakers demanded the city appeal the ruling to the Oregon Supreme Court and assign Frashour to a desk job with no public contact if he must be rehired. "We don't feel safe with him walking the streets," Rev. Dr. T. Allen Bethel at the protest organized by the Albina Ministerial Alliance Coalition for Justice and Police Reform. The City Attorney's Office is reviewing the ruling, and a decision on whether to appeal it could come soon, according to Hales' communcation director, Sara Hottman. "The Appeals Court's decision is still being reviewed. With Mayor Hales out of town and a skeleton crew in the City Attorney's office, that determination will likely be made next week," says Hottman. Frashour, who was deployed as a sniper during a lengthy standoff at a Northeast Portland motel, said he shot Campell in the back as he appeared to be reaching for his waistband. Police who responded to the motel has been told Campbell had a gun, but he had left it in his room before walking outside, where he was confronted by police. Frashour was placed on leave on Aug. 27, 2010, and terminated on Nov. 16, 2010. The Portland Police Association appealed the firing through the contract grievance process and State Arbitrator Jane Wilkinson ordered him reinstated on March 30, 2012. The city appealed the order to the appeals court but lost in a ruling issued Wednesday. Rev. Kate Lore, social justice minister at the First Unitarian Church, read a statement from Marla Davis, Campbell's mother, to Frashour. "You are a liability. You don't value other peoples' lives. Putting you back on the streets is a mistake," it said in part. Mayor Charlie Hales says he is disappointed with the ruling but will reinstate Frashour. "With this regrettable decision, the officer will return to the Bureau and be assigned to appropriate duty," Hales says. "Meanwhile, we will continue efforts to build a Police Bureau that serves the community through relationships and an understanding that the police are the public, and the public are the police.” Several speakers criticized what they said is a pattern of arbitrators and courts overruling city efforts to discipline officers who use excessive force, usually against minorities. Examples include: Scott McCollister, who was reinstated after being suspended for shooting and killing African American Kendra James in 2003; Douglas Erickson, who reinstated after being suspended for shooting and wounding African American Gerald Gratton in the back in 1993; Richard Montee and Paul Wickersham, who were reinstated after being fired for selling T-Shirts reading "Don't Choke 'Em, Smoke 'Em" after an officer choked African American security guard Lloyd "Tony" Stevenson in 1985; Craig Ward and Jim Galloway,who were reinstated after being fired for tossing dead opossums on the porch of the African American-owned Burger Barn restaurant in 1981. In one case where the victim, was white, Lt. Jeffrey Kaer was reinstated after being fired for shooting and killing Dennis Young in 2006. "We have to find a way to prevent arbitrators from overturning disciplinary rulings," said Dan Handelman of Portland Copwatch. Hales says the city has successfully disciplined other officers over the years, however. He notes that since 2013, 11 bureau employees have been terminated, or left employment in lieu of termination, for violation of bureau policies, including use-of-force. One example is Dane Reister, who was fired in October 2013 for mistakenly shooting and critically wounding a mentally ill man with lethal instead of less-the-lethal shotgun rounds. Reister committed suicide in May 2015 while facing criminal charges for the incident. He was the first Portland officer to ever be indicted for force used on duty. Hales also says that several changes in police tactics and training have been made as the result of Campbell's death. They include: establishment of the Behavioral Health Unit; training of Enhanced Crisis Intervention Team officers; continued emphasis in training on de-escalation of people in mental health crisis; re-evaluating the Bureau's Less Lethal Directives to ensure uniformity; and conducting command officer training on leadership in tactical incidents. "Every day officers avoid using force by de-escalating tense and dangerous situations; the number of times police use force has declined by 37 percent since 2010, and represents just 3 percent of arrests today. And officers use force in less than 1 percent of all citizen contacts. Employees who cannot perform up to those standards should be terminated, and have been," Hales says.
