NewsProtesters march through downtown Tampa TAMPA — With chants of "no justice, no peace," and holding signs stating "Indict the System," about 200 demonstrators briefly closed the Kennedy Boulevard Bridge downtown Friday night to protest what they described as rampant police brutality in U.S. cities."We will do what we need to do," Eric Williams, 31, a University of South Florida maintenance worker and member of the New Black Panther Party, said from Kennedy Boulevard near N Franklin Street. "We are not here for violence. We are just trying to prove a point."The group amassed at downtown's Lykes Gaslight Park about 6 p.m. before eventually marching west on Kennedy Boulevard toward the bridge and the University of Tampa.Chanting "shut it down," they closed the bridge for about 15 minutes before returning to Gaslight Park and then moving toward Curtis Hixon Park, where another rally was staged.The event lasted about three hours, although many of the demonstrators had started to melt away from the crowd about 8:30 p.m., with some heading toward cars and nearby restaurants.Though mostly young and consisting of several races, they came from all walks — students, professionals and blue-collar workers. At the same time protests were occurring in Tampa, simultaneous demonstrations were happening in Miami and Jacksonville."This is what I love. This is the America that I love, people of all races, black, white, Hispanic, coming together to fight injustice," said Ashley Johnson, 28, of Tampa, a product evaluator at St. Petersburg-based HSN.Her friend Char Singleton, 27, an organizer and member of the nonprofit American Association of University Women, said she wanted the demonstration to express the frustration felt by many at the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., and Eric Garner, in New York. Grand juries in the two cities both declined to indict the police officers who killed the men.Singleton sketched posters of Brown and Garner with crowns hovering above their heads."I feel that they are martyrs and that people need to wake up, and that's why I have the crowns, to show that they are martyrs," she said.About a dozen uniformed Tampa police on bicycles oversaw the protest and helped ensure traffic flowed smoothly or was safely halted to protect the protesters.As the group stood at Franklin and Kennedy, police used their bicycles to form a fence to ensure the protesters did not spill out into the oncoming traffic on Kennedy. No arrests or acts of violence were reported."This was a great crowd and they got their message across," Tampa police Sgt. Mark Delage said as the event was winding down. "We were here as a contingency, in case things happen. We believe in the Constitution and their right to free speech, but we will not tolerate criminal acts."In Miami, hundreds of protesters marched through city streets Friday evening and onto Interstate 195, jamming the highway, Midtown and Wynwood for hours as part of a national response to police-involved killings.Contact Rich Shopes at rshopes@tampabay.com or (813) 226-3368.
