"They're not safe anymore."The morning started slow but picked up steam when between 35 and 40 protesters from Ferguson, Missouri arrived. When they showed up, the crowd quickly huddled together to listen as speakers talked about Tamir Rice and police shootings from around the country."That man had a BB gun, something he's allowed to play with," Michael Hassell, a Ferguson protester, said.Mildretta Davis, Tamir's grandmother, told the crowd that "we just want justice and we just want peace." And Tavon Rice said his brother's death "wasn't supposed to happen."The protesters chanted "fists up, fight back" and "no justice, no peace." While the crowd was animated, it was never hostile, and police officers stayed in their cars at the edge of the recreation center's parking lot.Throughout it all, Lloyd Robinson of Cleveland watched as he continuously wiped tears from his face with a handkerchief."These cops, they know what they're doing, and getting away with it," Robinson, 75, said. "Shoot [Tamir] in the leg. There's all kinds of things they could have done. They didn't do it."Rice, 12, was fatally shot on Nov. 22 by rookie Cleveland police officer Timothy Loehmann seconds after he arrived to investigate a complaint about Rice carrying what turned out to be a fake gun.After the recreation center, the protesters were headed to Cleveland police's First District headquarters on West 130th Street. They were also scheduled to go to the Second District Headquarters on Fulton Road, Steelyard Commons, downtown and East 40th Street and Community College Avenue.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
