Trump has also criticized free-agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick -- who launched the wave of protests during the anthem last season when he kneeled to protest police brutality against African-Americans and other issues -- on multiple occasions and made claims that players who protest during the anthem should be suspended or released. Several players and coaches reacted strongly to Trump on social media, and players -- joined by coaches and owners, in some instances -- across the league knelt, locked arms, raised their fists and even refused to come out of the locker room during the national anthem in Week 3. There have been several more protests since.Previous protests this season, by week: 13 | 12 | 11 | 10 | 9 | 8 | 7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | PreseasonHere are the players who protested in Week 14 (most recent updates first):Miami Dolphins: Wide receiver Kenny Stills, safety Michael Thomas and tight end Julius Thomas took a knee on the field during the national anthem before the Dolphins' game against the Patriots on Monday night. The trio previously stayed in the locker room for the anthem against the Jets in Week 8, but they have kneeled the past few weeks. Coach Adam Gase had established a team rule requiring players to either stand for the anthem or stay in the tunnel, but Gase recently told players that if they wanted to come out and kneel, they could do it and they won't be punished for it. -- James WalkerSeattle Seahawks: As they have for much of the season, several members of the Seahawks' defensive line sat during the national anthem before their game at Jacksonville. Those sitting on the bench were: Michael Bennett, Branden Jackson, Cliff Avril, Jarran Reed, Frank Clark, Quinton Jefferson, Marcus Smith, Dion Jordan and Sheldon Richardson. Left tackle Duane Brown took a knee, while center Justin Britt stood next to him and held his hand on Brown's shoulder in a show of support. -- Brady HendersonLos Angeles Rams: Outside linebacker Robert Quinn put his right fist in the air during the national anthem before the Rams' game against the Eagles. Punter Johnny Hekker put his arm around Quinn as a show of support. -- Alden GonzalezLos Angeles Chargers: Left tackle Russell Okung stood with the rest of his teammates during the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Redskins, raising his right fist for the third straight week. Okung had not raised his fist the two weeks before that as the NFL honored the military, but he did earlier this season. Okung said last week that despite an agreement in principle between the NFL and the Players Coalition to address criminal justice reform, he will continue to protest during the national anthem on game days. He attended a meeting in October with NFL owners and commissioner Roger Goodell to discuss how the league would handle anthem protests. Earlier this season, Okung wrote an open letter to other NFL players on The Players' Tribune, with the goal of overcoming "uncharted territory" by opening a line of communication and responding with "one voice‚Äù as players. -- Eric D. WilliamsTennessee Titans: Wide receiver Rishard Matthews stayed in the locker room during the national anthem before Sunday's game against the Cardinals. He has protested by remaining in the locker room during the anthem for every game since Week 3, with Week 10 being an exception due to Veterans Day. -- Cameron WolfeSan Francisco 49ers: Once again, three 49ers -- safety Eric Reid, linebacker Eli Harold and receiver Marquise Goodwin -- knelt in protest of racial inequality during the national anthem before Sunday's game against Houston. Defensive end Solomon Thomas, defensive tackle Earl Mitchell, safety Adrian Colbert and linebacker Reuben Foster stood behind that trio with a hand on their shoulder in a show of support. -- Nick WagonerNew York Giants: Olivier Vernon continued to be the only Giants player to protest, kneeling during the anthem before Sunday's game against the Cowboys. It was his fifth game back after missing four games with an ankle injury. Vernon has done so at every game since Week 3 in Philadelphia. He said recently he plans to continue kneeling until the real message behind the protests is understood by the public. -- Jordan RaananOakland Raiders: Running back Marshawn Lynch remained seated during the national anthem before the Raiders' game against the Chiefs. He has remained seated during the national anthem all season, though he stood for the Mexican national anthem three weeks ago in the Raiders' game in Mexico City. Lynch has not said why he has remained seated during the national anthem. He wore a T-shirt before the team's Week 4 game that read, "EVERYBODY -VS- TRUMP." -- Paul GutierrezNew Orleans Saints: Most of the Saints players briefly knelt in unity before the national anthem against the Falcons on Thursday night, as they have done in their past nine games. They then all stood during the anthem, with some players and coaches locking arms. -- Mike TriplettNote: Kansas City Chiefs cornerback Marcus Peters, who has stayed in the tunnel during the national anthem recently, was suspended for Sunday's game.
