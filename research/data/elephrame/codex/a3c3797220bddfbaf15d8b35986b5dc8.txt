LOUIS • About 200 Black Lives Matter protesters marched through downtown St. Louis early Friday evening in response to recent police shootings in Minnesota and Louisiana.The rally, which was scheduled before the killing of five police officers in Dallas on Thursday night, lasted nearly an hour and culminated with a "die-in” on the steps of City Hall.Aside from the inconvenience to rush-hour traffic at 5 p.m., no other altercations or disruptions appear to have taken place.Protesters gathered near Soldiers Memorial before heading east on Market Street, walking down the middle of the road toward the Old Courthouse, blocking traffic as they went. For portions of the march, police cleared traffic ahead of them and behind them, though there were still moments where protesters circled around an intersection and blocked traffic, drawing honks from motorists. They passed by the circuit court buildings, turned south on Broadway and looped back west, passing Busch Stadium and the federal courthouse on their way to City Hall, where they arrived around 5:30 p.m. pic.twitter.com/eLE14TEcnJ— Walker Moskop (@WalkerMoskop) July 8, 2016 pic.twitter.com/U63PbDUWvB— Walker Moskop (@WalkerMoskop) July 8, 2016 "The plan was to walk to all the places where we felt socially and politically wronged,” said Reid Chunn, 20, of north St. Louis County.Johnathan McFarland, who said he had helped organize the rally, spoke to the crowd on themes familiar to anyone attending protests in the last two years: racism, police brutality and poverty. McFarland said the rally had a specific purpose, to protest "Blue Lives Matter” laws, which he said were unnecessary. "Police don't need special protection under the law,” he said. "They already have protection.”McFarland also said he wanted the message of the protest to be about peace, and during a moment of silence, asked protesters to keep in their thoughts a Ballwin police officer who was shot during a traffic stop Friday morning.As they marched through downtown, protesters chanted things such as, "Hands up, don't shoot,” and "Whose street? Our street.” When they gathered on the City Hall steps, protesters yelled: "Say his name! Alton Sterling! Say his name!” Sterling was shot and killed by police in Baton Rouge, La., on Wednesday.
