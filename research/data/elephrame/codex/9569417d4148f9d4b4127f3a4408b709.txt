While glass can be repaired; people's lives cannot. Mari Kurashi, President The Jessie is home to many of Jacksonville's leading non-profit organizations, who are working to provide relief to people in the midst of the pandemic and resulting economic shock. These non-profits work daily to redress the structural inequities that exist for the constituents they serve. Let us stand together, channeling our solidarity and energy with those amongst us who experience racism and injustice. Let us direct our focus toward making real, positive and essential change.” Mari Kurashi, President 4:58 p.m.: Protesters moved from the courthouse again and marched through the streets of Downtown Jacksonville.
