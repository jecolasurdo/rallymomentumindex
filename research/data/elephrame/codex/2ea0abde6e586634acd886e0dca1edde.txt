Carolina Hidalgo | St. Louis Public Radio Students in St. Louis raised their voices on Saturday morning to protest racial profiling and systemic police violence against African-Americans. More than 50 people attended the Black Lives Matter youth protest in downtown St. Louis. Police cars flanked the marchers as they walked down the center of Olive Street to the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department headquarters, chanting and carrying signs with slogans like "Students for Black Lives” and "Don't Shoot.” Students take part in a die-in to remember people killed by St. Louis police last year.

"Race determines access to education, access to healthy food and who gets punished and who doesn't,” said Fechter. "I would like to make people aware that this is still an issue, there are still these disparities.” Co-organizer Devin Corley leads a chant while marching down Olive Street.

Ferguson, who spoke at the March for Our Lives event, said efforts to reform gun legislation and police brutality are closely linked. State Sen.

"We need to support all causes.” The students say they will continue to organize and demand reform of the criminal justice system in St. Louis.

March for Our Lives: St. Louis rallies against gun violence By Shahla Farzan & Lindsay Toler • Mar 24, 2018 Carolina Hidalgo | St. Louis Public Radio Thousands of people marched in downtown St. Louis on Saturday morning to protest gun violence and advocate for stricter gun control. Saturday's March for Our Lives event was a culmination of a month-long effort to honor the 17 people killed during the Feb. 14 school shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Survivors of the shooting helped organize the rally in Washington, D.C., with sister marches occurring across the U.S. — including the one in St. Louis — and around the world. As a light rain fell, demonstrators chanted and carried signs reading "enough is enough” and "make our schools safe again.” We are a non-profit and member-supported service of © 2020 St. Louis Public Radio About Us Careers Contact Us Privacy Policy Public File
