As the U.S national anthem played before the start of matches yesterday, players across the NFL symbolically took to one knee, while the entire Pittsburgh Steelers team remained in their locker room until play commenced. The show of defiance came after President Trump hit out at players who perform the symbolic gesture, which was started in 2016 by San Francisco 49ers Quarterback Colin Kaepernick in a protest against police brutality. Advertisement "Wouldn't you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag, you'd say, 'Get that son of a bitch off the field right now. Out! He's fired!”', Trump told a crowd during a rally in Alabama on Friday night. Now, John Legend and Ice Cube have shown their support for the players who subsequently took the knee during NFL games yesterday afternoon, with their support coming after Stevie Wonder showed solidarity during a gig on Saturday night. Posting on Instagram, Legend shared a photo of himself taking the knee during a show in Hamburg, with his powerful gesture being echoed by images of 1960s civil rights protests in the background.

"The players' protests are important. Because of them, almost every day of the week, we talk about racial disparities. People across this country are suddenly thinking about what it must feel like to be a person of color, watch an officer shoot an unarmed man, and walk away with a pension”, Legend wrote.

"Never let a son of a bitch distract you from doing what's right”, he wrote.
