Students protest racism at Purdue Taya Flores, tflores@jconline.com Published 2:19 p.m. ET Nov. 13, 2015 | Updated 9:33 p.m. ET Nov. 13, 2015CLOSE Hundreds of students and faculty rallied, Friday, Nov. 13, 2015, on the Purdue University campus in West Lafayette, Indiana to protest racism on campus.

"We want change, and we are willing to do what we need to do until we get it. This is not a one-time thing. We have to keep this going."That was the message Friday afternoon as hundreds gathered near the Class of 1950 Lecture Hall to show support for student protests at the University of Missouri and air their grievances about Purdue.The Purdue Social Justice Coalition and Students of Purdue Against Racism Coalition organized the Mizzou Solidarity Rally and a social media blitz that encouraged students to share personal stories of racism on Purdue's campus.Rally protesters held signs that read "We belong" and "#BlackonCampus" and chanted such phrases as "Mitch, let's face it, it's time to deal with racists" and "Where's Mitch?"During the rally, organizers read a list of 13 demands, which included the reinstatement of a chief diversity officer. The position, formerly held by G. Christine Taylor, was eliminated in July. Provost Deba Dutta has since taken over leadership of diversity efforts at the university.JOURNAL AND COURIERPurdue eliminates chief diversity positionThey also wanted President Mitch Daniels to acknowledge racism exists on campus and apologize for the recent letter saying Purdue is a "proud contrast" to Mizzou and Yale."I felt like his letter reinforced the silence put upon the black experience at universities," said Chanel Beebe, a doctoral student and a rally organizer, during a prior phone call. "I understand our country's attachment to free speech, but whenever that free speech becomes hate speech, we need to sit down and have a dialogue."More than 25 faculty also released a letter in support of the protest and denied Daniels' claim that Purdue is a "proud contrast" to Mizzou and Yale.Daniels, however, was not available due to a prior engagement, according to Brian Zink, a university spokesman.Other demands included: by 2020, an increase in minority students and faculty by 30 percent and 20 percent, respectively; more merit and need-based financial assistance for minority students; creation of cultural representatives for undergraduate and graduate student governments; and a required cultural awareness class for police, students, staff and faculty.During the rally, various students stepped up to speak about their experience on campus.They talked about being called racial slurs and dealing with stereotypes, insults and the isolation they feel as black students.James Haynes, a graduate civil engineering student, said he's felt isolated in class."I bleed black and gold every time I walk in a classroom and no one wants to look at me," he said.After the rally, he discussed how peers have declined to work on class projects with him. Haynes assumes it was largely due to the stereotype that blacks are lazy or unintelligent."It was a perception that I would have nothing to contribute to their work groups that they had," he said.FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInPHOTOS: Purdue students protest racism on campus FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

"It's not just me and my interpretation; there's an issue on campus."Beebe also said whites shouldn't ignore these complaints simply because they don't experience them."One of the biggest issues on Purdue's campus and on white institutions in this country is that nobody seems to recognize that white privilege means that you cannot see the things that I'm experiencing unless you try," she said during a phone interview.During the rally, she also encouraged students to interact across racial lines."Stop asking your white friends why black students are angry," she said. "Ask us."Venetria Patton, a Purdue professor and provost fellow for diversity and inclusion, also attended the rally.She said the administration is taking action, contrary to the students' perception that they are being ignored."Things are moving but just not as quickly as students would like to see," she said.She said the provost's Diversity Transformation Award, a $1 million research project incentive, not only aims to improve recruitment and retention among minority faculty but students as well, and will address the cultural climate at Purdue.JOURNAL AND COURIERPurdue invests $1 million in campus diversityRecent protests date back to 2012 with one occurring just last year.Last December, the Purdue Social Justice Coalition led a march across campus in response to the police-involved deaths of black men in Ferguson, Missouri, and New York City.The students used the national instances of racial instability to address racial profiling and harassment on campus and in Greater Lafayette.They gave the administration a list of demands, but once the semester ended, the momentum faded.Haynes said this time will be different."We're pretty adamant that we're going to be persistent beyond the end of the semester."First demand at Purdue #Boilersofpurdue rally: Mitch Daniels needs to get it.
