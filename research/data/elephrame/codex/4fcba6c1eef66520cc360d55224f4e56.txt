Counter-protesters will rally during white supremacist march in Princeton - nj.comSkip to ArticleNewsCounter-protesters will rally during white supremacist march in PrincetonUpdated Jan 11, 2019; Posted Jan 11, 2019 By Olivia Rizzo | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com and Steve Strunsky | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com UPDATE: White supremacist group had 20 members 'at most' and faked rally for publicity--At least one organization is planning a counter-protest during a white supremacist group's march in Princeton Saturday, leading local officials to issue warnings urging the opposing sides to keep the peace.Black Lives Matter began the process to obtain a permit with the Princeton Police Department to have a counter-demonstration at the same time and place as a march hosted by the New Jersey European Heritage Association -- noon Saturday in Palmer Square. The NJEHA has not applied for a permit, Police Chief Nick Sutter confirmed. As of Thursday, no other counter-groups had either, though police urged any groups planning gatherings to apply for permits.It's unclear how many people are expected to attend either side of the march. The last time the NJEHA rallied in Princeton, five people participated, officials said.Still, police are planning a heavy presence in the area Saturday, when Sutter speculated the number of counter-protesters may outnumber the original demonstrators.The Central Jersey Democratic Socialists of America is working with other local grassroots organizations to spread the word about counter-protests and have created a Facebook event to alert the local community. "People who attended the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, (Virginia) are trying to gain sympathy and attract like-minded people in Princeton," Ayesha Mughal, the Central Jersey chapter's co-chair, said in a statement."We believe that the best way to avoid a violent confrontation will be to overwhelm them with numbers and deny them the space to spread their genocidal ideology.”Princeton Mayor Liz Lempert said she was confident that the turnout by counter-demonstrators would be at least as large as that of NJEHA members and supporters."Hate has no home here,” she said. "We pride ourself on being a welcoming community.”Portions of the square where the event is set to take place are privately owned."Palmer Square Management has not been consulted nor did we authorize any activity by any group on the square," said Jamie Volkert, marketing director for the company."Upon being alerted to the situation, we contacted the town and local officials. We have the utmost confidence in local authorities to handle the matter and protect the best interest and safety of the general public.”Requests for comment left via the NJEHA website and phone number were not returned.Those in the area Thursday were not overly concerned about the protest."I'm not worried. I think local authorities have everything under control,” said Jill Wargo, the owner of Highbar Boutique. Her shop faces out onto the green space of Palmer Square. Nothing happened, she said, when the NJEHA held a rally on Palmer Square in November of last year.But, Wargo said, she is concerned about how the event will impact her business -- Saturday is usually a busy day for her store, especially during January."They have a right to say what they want, but I do wish they'd think about the other people in the area they are impacting by being here," she said of the white supremacist group.Fellow business owner Matt Banihoni of Chez Alice Gourmet Cafe & Bakery said he is also not worried about those who plan to protest on Saturday."It doesn't mater if you're a white supremacist or (whatever) coming from somewhere. We've had protests here before,” Banihoni said.What is the NJEHA?The New Jersey European Heritage Association is a white supremacist group that is small and not widely known, that spreads hateful propaganda but lacks a history of violence or much activity of any kind, according to state officials and hate group watch dogs."The only hit that we have on them was they were at the Unite the Right rally in August 2018,” said Lecia Brooks, outreach director for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups nationwide.At this point, Brooks said, the law center has not designated the NJEHA as a hate group, but that it would add the latest activity in Princeton to the group's file and continue to monitor its activities.The NJEHA was cited by the New Jersey Department of Homeland Security in a March 2018 analysis of "recent white supremacist activity” in the state, referring to the posting of recruitment flyers in downtown Princeton that month.The Anti-Defamation League refers to the group as "a small, New Jersey-based white supremacist group,” that "espouses racism, anti-Semitism and intolerance under the guise of 'saving' white European peoples from purported imminent extinction.”"ADL closely monitors all white supremacist and extremist activity in New Jersey and all over the country and will be monitoring events in Princeton over the weekend," said Alex Rosemberg, the ADL's associate regional director.Olivia Rizzo may be reached at orizzo@njadvancemedia.com.
