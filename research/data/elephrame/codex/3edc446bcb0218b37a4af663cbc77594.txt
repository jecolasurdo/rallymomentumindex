Memorial event held in Frayser for Brandon WebberCorinne S KennedyMemphis Commercial AppealTwo dozen green and white balloons floated skyward over Frayser Sunday evening, bearing messages of hope for the future and anger about young lives lost in acts of violence. In the parking lot below, the 30 community members who attended the healing circle event organized by the Black Lives Matter Memphis chapter watched their wishes disappear into the blue sky as they regrouped for pizza after an hour-long discussion about the death of Brandon Webber. Pamela Moses, a potential mayoral candidate who facilitated the event, said the event was a way for community members of all ages to peacefully process what had happened to Webber. "The reason we elected to have this, instead of a protest, is there's a lot of trauma in this community,” she said. "We don't really know what happened to him but we know he's gone from here and that's tragic.”Webber, 20, was shot and killed by members of a U.S. Marshal Service task force in his mother's driveway on June 12. Officers were attempting to serve multiple felony warrants stemming from a June 3 shooting in DeSoto County. Mississippi authorities allege Webber shot a man five times and stole a vehicle. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation--which is investigating the shooting by the Marshals--said Webber tried to ram his vehicle into the officer's vehicles multiple times before exiting his vehicle with a weapon. Officials have not said what kind of weapon Webber may have had. No officers with the Marshals Service were injured. The shooting sparked protests, which damaged a fire station and injured Memphis police and Shelby County deputies, in Frayser in the hours after the incident. At vigils in the days and weeks following the shooting, Webber's mother, Jaleta Clark, and activists called for calm and demanded answers from public officials and law enforcement agencies. "What happened in Frayser was a whole lot of things that were bottled up,” Moses said Sunday. During the healing circle, Moses asked children at the event to share their thoughts about Webber and how law enforcement officers treat black Memphians. "Regardless of what they said he did, his life mattered,” she said. "I hope that being here today has given you a sense of hope. That's what we need in Frayser, hope. There are good people out here."Before the balloon release, Frayser-born singer Jayla Mariee, who now lives in Nashville, performed the song "Dear Memphis,” which she wrote the lyrics to and talked to the crowd about how she was processing Webber's death. "To this day we still don't have justice for it. Only God knows why,” she said. "God lets everything happen for a reason. I might not know why it happened but I know God's gonna cover me and my family through that.”Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Public Notices Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My AccountSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJob Network Cars Homes Classifieds Education Moonlighting Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2020 www.commercialappeal.com.
