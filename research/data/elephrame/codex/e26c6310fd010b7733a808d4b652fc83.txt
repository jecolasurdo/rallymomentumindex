'Something needs to change': Residents rally in Great Falls to protest police brutalityKarl Puckett, Great Falls Tribune Published 9:02 p.m. MT May 31, 2020 | Updated 9:25 p.m. MT May 31, 2020CLOSE Dozens of residents rallied along Central Avenue West in Great Falls Sunday in the wake of the death of a black man in police custody in Minneapolis. Great Falls TribuneCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREA few hundred people thrust signs and fists in the air to protest the death of George Floyd in a peaceful rally in Great Falls Sunday afternoon.Floyd, a black man, died in police custody in Minneapolis on Memorial Day. "You know, something needs to change," Geraldine Reid, who is black, said as she stood on the Central Avenue West bridge. "My kids have to grow up in this world."Sons Isaiah, 12, Josiah and Kaeden, both 10, and nephew Terrance, 12, stood beside her.Isaiah held a sign that said, "I can't breath, I can't jog, I can't kneel, I can't live.""It's been going on for too long," Reid said. "It's too much."Buy PhotoGeraldine Reid of Great Falls waves to passing motorists during a rally Sunday on the Central Avenue West bridge in the wake of George Floyd's death in police custody in Minneapolis on Memorial Day. (Photo: Karl Puckett/Great Falls Tribune)The 5 p.m. rally was organized by Great Falls residents Jasmine Taylor, Laura Wight and Helena Lovick to protest the death of Floyd, 46, who died after pleading, "I can't breathe" as a white police officer used his knee to pin him down by his neck beside a squad car. The incident, recorded by a bystander, sparked coast-to-coast protest in cities across the country."We think it's our job to use our privilege to speak out against violence against innocent black people," Taylor said as a crowd gathered in the parking lot of the Missouri River Federal Courthouse.Others are reading: Protest against virus restrictions held at Montana CapitolThe protest was not aimed at Great Falls police, who Taylor said had been supportive of efforts to organize the rally. The Great Falls rally drew a mix of white, black and Native American residents.Motorists passing by honked and yelled and offered thumbs up to residents who lined both sides of the Central Avenue Bridge.Wearing masks to prevent the spread of coronavirus, they held signs reading, "We need leaders who are peacemakers and healers," "Rise up against racism" and "Silence is violence." "I'm all for peaceful protests, so the fact it's a peaceful protest is very important to me," said Danielle Elledge, who, wearing cowboy boots, struggled in the wind to keep her balance as she stood on the top of a small post protecting a fire hydrant holding a sign that read, "Black Lives Matter." Danielle Elledge of Great Falls was one of a few hundred people who attended a rally Sunday on Central Avenue West in Great Falls to protest the death of George Floyd of Minneapolis, who died in police custody.

"You're the problem," he said. Peaceful protest is how systematic change begins, Taylor said. "Police brutality, it has to change," said Debbie McShane of Great Falls, who's American Indian Movement flag flapped in the wind. "Everybody is created equally. We all bleed the same."Debbie McShane and her children, Kendalyn and Sky Running Enemy, attend a rally Sunday on Central Avenue West in the wake of the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis.

He mentioned Mattie Bost Bell Castner, who was born into slavery.She traveled from St Louis to Fort Benton in 1876 where she became the owner of a successful laundry and met and later married John K. Castner. The couple settled in a log cabin on Belt Creek. For 40 years, the Castners pursued separate commercial endeavors, while offering hospitality and support to the people in the Belt area.John became the father of Belt and Mattie, the Mother of Belt.Residents lined both sides of the Central Avenue West bridge during a rally Sunday in Great Falls. "This crowd is amazing," said Jasmine Taylor, one of the event's organizers.
