The rally started at UT in front of the university's Martin Luther King Jr. statue, where several speakers quoted King and said many of the struggles he fought for still remain today."To this day, a black man can be choked to death on camera ... and his murderer will not see a day in jail, will not see a day in court," said Kaleb Taylor of the Houston Justice Coalition, referring to the death of Eric Garner, who died while in the chokehold of a New York City police officer in July.Mike Lowe, who drove from San Antonio for Saturday's event, said he wants to tackle the issue of police brutality so that his children, a 15-year-old son and a 7-year-old daughter, will have a better life."They don't have a chance if we as leaders, as people of the community, don't speak up," he said.The speakers at the rally also discussed black women who have died at the hands of police and talked about the black LGBT community, both topics that they said need more attention."If black lives matter, I should be able to get married in Texas and have my rights," said Ashton P. Woods, a black LGBT activist. "We exist. We're here with you. We stand in solidarity."Throughout the rally, the organizers urged attendees to continue to fight to do away with injustices, to speak to each other and to connect in order to continue organizing."What we're doing is a movement based on love," said Xene Sky, one of the event's organizers. "Love isn't sitting at home saying 'I wish things would change.' Love is actively facilitating change."After the rally, the crowd — which was made up of different races, ethnicities, religions and ages — marched to the Capitol and walked into the state Senate chambers.
