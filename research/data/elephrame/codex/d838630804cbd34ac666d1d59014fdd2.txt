Protesters: Convict Tensing this time, no excusesMark Curnutte, Cincinnati Enquirer Published 4:47 p.m. ET May 25, 2017 | Updated 5:27 p.m. ET May 25, 2017Joe Mallory, vice president of the Cincinnati NAACP branch, protests outside the Hamilton County Courthouse on Day 1 of Ray Tensing's retrial.(Photo: The Enquirer/Mark Curnutte)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORENeither rain nor repetition could dampen the spirit of about 40 protesters Thursday outside of the Hamilton County Courthouse.The protestors, representing mainly Black Lives Matter and the Cincinnati NAACP, were there to call for the conviction of former University of Cincinnati police officer Ray Tensing in his retrial.Tensing faces murder and voluntary manslaughter charges in the shooting death of unarmed black motorist Sam DuBose in July 2015. Tensing's first trial ended Nov. 12 in a hung jury.Inside, up to 200 potential jurists filled out questionnaires.Outside, protesters chanted, "No justice, no peace, no racist police.""For us, a lot has not changed since we mobilized for the first trial," said Brian Taylor, co-steering committee chair of Black Lives Matter: Cincinnati. "The stakes are high. The preponderance of the evidence in this case – and cases like it across the country – should instantly convict Ray Tensing of murder."Black Lives Matter is part of the larger Countdown to Conviction Coalition. Other groups represented were Peaslee Neighborhood Center, the Homeless Coalition of Greater Cincinnati, University of Cincinnati Students for Survivors and the Contact Center.The coalition plans again to have a presence outside the courthouse each day of the Tensing retrial, Taylor said. The coalition had to postpone a plan Wednesday night rally because of thunderstorms. It has rescheduled the rally for 6 p.m. May 31 at Inwood Park, Mount Auburn.Students for Survivors formed in August 2016 at UC in support of sexual assault victims."These issues are intersectional," said Grace Cunningham, a third-year student majoring in sociology, asked why her group had joined in calling for Tensing's conviction.A dozen members of the NAACP, led by first vice president Joe Mallory, held signs and chanted. His sign included an image of the Confederate Battle Flag. Tensing wore a T-shirt under his uniform the day of the shooting emblazoned with the flag, widely considered a white supremacist image. Tensing's defense has indicated it will try to have the T-shirt excluded from the second trial."We are here because we want justice, we want a conviction, we want jail time," Mallory said. "I'm hopeful the right thing will be done this time."CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2017/05/25/protesters-convict-tensing-time-no-excuses/346494001/Find JobsShare your feedback to help improve our site experience!
