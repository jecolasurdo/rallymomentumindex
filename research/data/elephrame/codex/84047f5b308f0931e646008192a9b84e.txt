"We're here, and we're putting it right in front of them and they can't ignore it. We have to have our voices heard."Inside the building, several players decided to express themselves with a different type of volume.Cavaliers stars LeBron James and Kyrie Irving and several Nets players, including Kevin Garnett, Deron Williams, Jarrett Jack and Alan Anderson, all wore T-shirts with the phrase "I Can't Breathe" on them during pregame warmups.Garner's last words to police were, "I can't breathe," and the incident was caught on video, sparking outrage. A Staten Island grand jury last week decided not to indict the officer involved. After Chicago Bulls point guard Derrick Rose wore the shirt before a game Saturday, James decided he wanted to follow suit."This is more of a notion to the family more than anything," James said before Monday's game. "As a society, we have to do better. We have to be better for one another no matter what race you are. But it's more of a shoutout to the family more than anything because they're the ones who should be getting the energy and effort."Nets guard Jarrett Jack helped the Cavaliers procure the shirts."We're very, very socially conscious," Jack said after the game. "We aren't just focused on ourselves as just athletes and what goes on with our sport on a day to day basis. We collectively understand that this is an issue that needs to be addressed. The more attention we can bring and awareness to it is great. It's not a color issue, it's a people issue. It's a citizen issue and everybody is due due process and that's the one thing we're striving for."The gesture inside the arena was appreciated by those who stood outside in frigid temperatures, remaining there until 30 minutes after tip-off."That's a result of them being educated brothers and having a slight moral compass," a protester identifying himself only as L.B. said. "They know they're on their grand stage. Anybody that has any type of public voice needs to stand up and say something."Irving said before the game, which the Cavaliers won 110-88, that he also wanted to honor Garner's family."Things happen within the world that you can't necessarily control but for me standing up and taking it as my own and being a part of something bigger than myself ... what happened is a tragedy," Irving said. "I feel terrible about it but it's just my emotions more or less for the condolences for the families."At this time, the players are not expected to be fined, a person familiar with the situation told USA TODAY Sports. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.Silver said in a statement, "I respect Derrick Rose and all of our players for voicing their personal views on important issues but my preference would be for players to abide by our on-court attire rules."Contributing: Sam AmickAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Corrections Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Terms of Service Your California Privacy Rights/Privacy Policy Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info/Cookie PolicyContact Us Help Center My Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop Reprints & Permissions Advertise Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Pinterest YouTube Reddit Flipboard RSS10Best Grateful Reviewed Thanksgiving.com Job Network Moonlighting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett ClassifiedsThe City The Wall Storytellers© 2020 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC.
