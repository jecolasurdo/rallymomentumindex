Groups call for policy change after violent J-town arrestsMandy McLarenLouisville Courier JournalA coalition of advocacy groups called on Jefferson County Public Schools on Tuesday to remove police officers from all district campuses, nearly a week after videos of a violent arrest at Jeffersontown High School spread widely on social media."We send our kids to school to become useful citizens, not to be controlled through brute force," said Barbara Boyd, chairwoman of the Kentucky Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression.About two dozen advocates from groups including the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky voiced their demands in front of JCPS headquarters, some holding yellow signs which read, "SCHOOL TO PRISON PIPELINE = COPS IN SCHOOLS." Under a drizzly sky, they chanted, "No police in our schools."Last Wednesday what began as a lunchroom fight between two students at Jeffersontown High escalated into a violent confrontation between students and police, including, police said, the use of a stun gun to subdue a student. In the wake of the incident, the district's acting superintendent, Marty Pollio, has called for two reviews to investigate both the school's response and its overall safety policies.Background:JCPS launches investigations after fight, stun gun used on Jeffersontown High studentMore:JCPS outlines progress after state demands immediate action in three key areasNationally, there is limited research on the effectiveness of school resource officers, according to a June 2013 Congressional Research Service report. But advocates on Tuesday said the presence of police officers on school campuses has a disproportionate effect on minority students, who they say are more likely to receive harsh punishments."What happened at J-town is part of a deep pattern of racial injustice," said Sonja Devries, a member of Louisville Showing Up for Racial Justice, one of the groups that organized the press conference. "More of us who are white need to stand with families of color," Devries said.The Jefferson County Board of Education was scheduled to hold a special meeting Tuesday night. Though the incident at Jeffersontown High was not slated to be on the agenda, advocates said they would attend to press the issue.In addition, groups including The Alliance for Education Justice and the Kentucky Alliance for Youth Development planned to hold a press conference before the meeting calling for the Jefferson County Board of Education to terminate its contract between Jeffersontown High and the Jeffersontown police department.According to the district, the incident at Jefferson High began when a school resource officer — a sworn law enforcement officer responsible for maintaining campus safety — intervened to stop a fight between two students in the school cafeteria. One of the students attacked the officer, officials said, prompting him to call Jeffersontown police for backup.More:JCPS revises policies after reports of child neglect and abuse in preschool programAt least two videos have since surfaced depicting what happened after Jeffersontown police arrived. One video appears to show a male student being pinned on the school's hallway floor by three officers. As other students look on, one officer appears to kick the student twice.Jeffersontown Police Chief Ken Hatmaker has since described the movement as a "knee strike” and called it an appropriate use of force given the circumstances. At one point in the same video, an officer appears to use the threat of his stun gun to keep back a crowd of students.Another video, presented by Jeffersontown Police, appears to show what happened before the student was subdued. In it, the male student can be seen striking an officer and then shoving him into a wall.The students involved were brothers and have been charged with assault and disorderly conduct, police said.Stephen Imhoff, who served on the JCPS board for more than a decade, stood alongside community advocates at Tuesday's press conference. He was there, he said, to show support for the groups' demands."We don't need police in our schools,” said Imhoff, an attorney who served on the board from 2002 to 2012. If students have negative interactions with police at school, they are less likely to feel safe or secure when they encounter an officer in the community, he said.Instead of relying on police, Imhoff said, schools should enhance their use of restorative practices, a discipline technique that focuses on repairing relationships rather than doling out punishments.Reporter Mandy McLaren can be reached at mmclaren@gannett.com.
