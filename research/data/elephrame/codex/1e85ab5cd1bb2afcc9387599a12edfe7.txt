"This brings a relevance and sense of authenticity to our protests because you can watch a demonstration in D.C. and people tend to separate themselves. But if you're driving around and you see people you may know out protesting about our civil rights being eroded it makes them stop and think.”Holt said demonstrators have been coming to Market Square every Sunday since November's general election. Each demonstration has a specific theme and Holt said this Sunday was for Black Lives Matter. Holt emphasized that people are welcome to demonstrate for any issue they feel needs attention."It's Civil Rights Sunday so everyone is welcome to bring what ever issue they are passionate about,” Holt said. "We ask folks to remain positive so we can open up a discussion with our community to be aware that these attacks on civil rights are not normal.”Demonstrators have convened on a weekly basis to protest the policies of the Trump administration. Now, according to demonstrator Stephanie Marshall, the question that hangs over their heads is how to turn their presence into action."This has become my place to come and get rejuvenated for the next week ahead,” said Marshall, of Exeter. "We are trying to encourage people from being observers in what is going on around them to actually taking the steps to talk to their neighbors about the news and I think people are waking up (and realizing) that it is not enough to just show up but that this will be a four-year ordeal.”Holt said that aside from the regular Civil Rights Sunday protests, Occupy Seacoast hosts "Moral Mondays,” which rotates to various Seacoast restaurants. At these events, activists write to elected officials and editors of local newspapers in an effort to raise awareness and inspire further action on a variety of civil rights topics, according to Holt.Anyone who is interested in getting involved is invited to the next Moral Monday event Feb. 27 at D Squared Java on Water Street in Exeter, according to Holt.
