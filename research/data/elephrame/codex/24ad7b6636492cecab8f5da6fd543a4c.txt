The anthem played. Other players remained standing. Everyone in the crowd remained standing. And Green remained on one knee, her right hand on her shoulder and her left on her knee.After a four-set loss to the seventh-ranked Gators, Green, a starter who is on scholarship with the Seminoles, gave some insight into why she isn't standing for the national anthem before games — at least for now.FSU volleyball player Mara Green kneels for national anthemShe's the latest in a group of athletes who've chosen to kneel during the national anthem as a form of protest. The protest was sparked by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, but it has since reached other NFL teams and other sports.There are plenty of people who think Green is being disrespectful — to the country, to the anthem, to the armed forces — but Green said that isn't the case."I have had several family members that have served in the military and I have the highest respect for those who serve our country,” she said Wednesday night, reading from a statement.After refusing to stand during the national anthem for the first time, Kaepernick told NFL.com, "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.”Green's statement carried some of the weight of Kaepernick's words — she's joining the protest to speak out against "racial injustice,” she said."I am unhappy with the racial tension, racial injustice and police brutality in our country,” Green said. "This is my way of silently and peacefully protesting.”After reading from the statement, Green didn't take questions from the media. FSU head coach Chris Poole released a statement on Tuesday regarding Green's protest — she'd already knelt once during the national anthem before a match on Friday."Mara made me aware of her intention to kneel for the national anthem,” he said. "Florida State University is an institution of higher learning that recognizes a student's right to freedom of expression. Similarly, I respect Mara's right to freely express herself.”KC's Peters raises fist, 4 Dolphins kneel during anthemsFor now, the statements from Green and her coach are the only comments coming from Florida State regarding the protest.Green's Twitter account, however, is filled with retweets of messages of support for her stance.Tuesday, she retweeted a Tallahassee Democrat story about her protest and added, "I can not stand for a flag that represents a country of people who will not take a stand against racial injustice.”As of Wednesday night, Green's Twitter bio was simple: "My generation isn't asking for permission.”That statement is followed by "Black Lives Matter” and a reference to her number on the volleyball team (35).Green isn't the first athlete to join the protest.According to reports, three black players from NAIA West Virginia University Tech's volleyball team chose to kneel before a Sept. 7 match against Emory & Henry.Staff Directory Corrections Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Public Notices Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My AccountSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJob Network Cars.com Tallahassee Homes Classifieds Education Moonlighting Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2020 www.tallahassee.com.
