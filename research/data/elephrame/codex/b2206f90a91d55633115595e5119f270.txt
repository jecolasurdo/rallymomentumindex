Causey: The stress of being black in the U.S. By Aaron Mak of the Journal Sentinel July 08, 2016 Wauwatosa — About 100 people marched from the Wauwatosa Police Department to Mayfair mall on Friday to protest the killing of Jay Anderson, a 25-year-old African-American man shot by an officer who found him sleeping in his car June 23 in Madison Park.The name of the officer has not been released. Demonstrators shouted at police outside the station Friday to demand the officer be identified and dashboard video of the shooting be released.The group proceeded to walk down the middle of W. North Ave. and Mayfair Road, holding up rush-hour traffic, with cars from local law enforcement agencies in tow. Marchers held "Black Lives Matter" signs and yelled, "justice for Jay."They eventually entered Mayfair mall and congregated on the second floor to chant together, while shop owners and customers watched from behind closed doors. "People are angry, not just about what happened with Jay but with the murders around the country," protester Jerrae Carrol said. Wauwatosa Police Chief Barry Weber provided initial information at the scene June 23, saying officers were investigating a suspicious vehicle in a parking lot and saw it was occupied by a person with a gun.The officer "fearing for his safety discharged his own weapon striking that person," Weber said.Wauwatosa police referred the case to Milwaukee police to fulfill a state law that requires a team of at least two investigators from an outside agency to lead investigations of officer-involved deaths."I'm as impatient as anyone," Weber said of the unreleased information.
