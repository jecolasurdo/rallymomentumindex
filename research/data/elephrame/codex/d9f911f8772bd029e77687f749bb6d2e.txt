Arrest them all!” the crowd chanted, referring to the four Minneapolis police officers who were seen on video during the apprehension of Floyd.The protest remained peaceful as demonstrators began to march down Market Street and onto Broad Street, with hundreds of additional people joining the original group of marchers. Most walked on the hot pavement past Newark City Hall and then headed back to Market Street, where they gathered again near the statue of a seated Abraham Lincoln at about 2:30 p.m. and chanted, "Black lives matter.”And they're off... pic.twitter.com/OIZAb451I8— Rebecca Panico (@BeccaPanico) May 30, 2020 Police presence was light, with just a few police cruisers blocking streets to keep vehicles away from the demonstrators, many carrying signs reading "I Can't Breathe” and "Black Lives Matter.” Other signs were critical of cops and some railed against white supremacy.The orderly demonstration in Newark was in sharp contrast to the violent protests, riots and looting that broke out in other cities across the nation during the past two nights. Protesters in other cities clashed with police, set fire to police cars and other vehicles, and torched businesses.Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died Monday after Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, knelt on his neck for several minutes while Floyd was handcuffed. Floyd, who was not armed and did not appear to be resisting arrest, was later pronounced dead at a hospital.Four police officers who were at the scene have been fired, and Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the case.Prior to the demonstration in Newark, Mayor Ras Baraka called Floyd's death outright murder, and demanded that all the officers involved be arrested."He was killed on purpose and murdered on purpose,” Baraka said.The People's Organization for Progress was formed to help eradicate racism and take on relevant social issues.March turning off of Market onto Broad now, heading to City Hall pic.twitter.com/SEx9kdb7FC— Michael Sol Warren (@MSolDub) May 30, 2020 This was Market Street alone. pic.twitter.com/u1MwEwKwag— Rebecca Panico (@BeccaPanico) May 30, 2020 Demonstrators gathered in Newark Saturday afternoon to protest the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis and to call for an end to police brutality.Michael Mancuso | NJ Advance Media for NJ.comNewark protest for #GeorgeFloyd pic.twitter.com/fNR3gF5AGs— Cathy Renna (@CathyRenna) May 30, 2020 Black Lives Matter Protest in Newark, NJ happening now pic.twitter.com/BRJu0hto5U— Nu New Jersey (@NuNewJersey_) May 30, 2020 The scene in Newark as a protest pic.twitter.com/5SNqoPyuc0— Anne-Marie Caruso (@AnneCarusoPhoto) May 30, 2020 Our journalism needs your support.
