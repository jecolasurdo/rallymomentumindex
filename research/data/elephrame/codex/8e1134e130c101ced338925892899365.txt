I will update this with information and analysis from the press box. 10:55 According to Adam Schefter, who cites "sources close to Chip Kelly,” the 49ers' head coach will not leave the 49ers this offseason to return to college football. What do you make of this report? Do you buy it? Why or why not? 11:50 Here are the 49ers' inactives: RB Carlos Hyde CB Rashard Robinson QB Christian Ponder OLB Aaron Lynch DL Mike Purcell OT John Theus WR Keshawn Martin 11:55 Here are the Saints' inactives: DB De'Vante Harris RB Marcus Murphy RB Daniel Lasco LB Dannell Ellerbe OL Landon Turner WR Tommylee Lewis DT John Jenkins 1:05 Jimmie Ward stood five feet in front of Colin Kaepernick as he knelt during the National Anthem and blocked photographers who were trying to take snapshots of the quarterback. 1:06 The 49ers win the toss and defer. 1:14 DeForest Buckner tips Drew Brees' pass on third-and-12, and the Saints punt. Niners start at their 24-yard line. 1:22 Colin Kaepernick overthrows DuJuan Harris in the flat on third-and-18. and on fourth down Phil Dawson makes a 49-yard field goal. 3-0 Niners. The Saints defense gave up 53 yards on the first three plays of the drive, then the 49ers committed two penalties and went backward. The tempo of the Niners' offense tends to give opposing defenses problems early games until the opponent adjusts. 1:33 Tim Hightower runs a draw and scores a touchdown from four yards out. 7-3 Saints. During that drive, the Niners' defense gave up a 32-yard catch to a wide open Josh Hill on third-and-1, a 23-yard catch to Michael Thomas on third-and-5, and a 9-yard catch to Coby Fleener on third-and-9. 1:39 On first-and-10 from the 49ers' 49, Colin Kaepernick stares down a throw to his left and gets intercepted by Craig Roberston. Saints ball at the Niners' 12. 1:42 Michael Thomas beats Jimmie Ward for a one-yard touchdown catch on third-and-goal. Easy. 14-3 Saints. Game over. 1:53 The Saints stop DuJuan Harris for no gain on fourth-and-1. Saints' ball at their 24. 2:03 On third-and-goal from the 5, Brees completes a screen pass to Ingram, and Ronald Blair tackles him into the end zone. Touchdown. The officials are reviewing the play to see if Ingram maintained control of the ball. Seems to me like he did. 2:06 Touchdown stands. 21-3 Saints. 2:12 On second-and-7, Kaepernick throws a swing pass to Harris behind the line of scrimmage and Harris runs 47 yards down the sideline for a touchdown. Horrifying defense from the Saints on that play. 21-10 New Orleans. 2:19 On first-and-10 from the Saints' 25, Mark Ingram runs off right tackle and runs 75 yards untouched for the touchdown. 28-10 Saints. Quinton Dial had no gap integrity on that play. Allowed himself to get pushed to the inside, which created a huge hole. 2:24 Kaepernick throws behind Jeremy Kerley on third-and-4 from the Saints' 39. Then Dawson makes a 48-yard field goal. The crows goes wild! 28-13 Saints. 2:33 Tramaine Brock breaks up a deep pass intended for Michael Thomas on third-and-4 form the Saints' 46. 2:37 Kaepernick throws a five yard pass to Vance McDonald who turns upfield and runs 60 yards untouched for a touchdown. 28-20 Saints. Some serious defense being played today. 2:45 The Saints drive the field and kick a field goal before halftime. 31-20 New Orleans. 3:03 Mike Davis fumbles at the Saints' 1-yard line and New Orleans recovers. 3:06 Saints go three-and-out. 3:13 Kaepernick throws a one-hopper to Kerley on third-and-10 from the Saints' 28. 3:14 Phil Dawson makes a 46-yard field goal. 31-23 Saints. 3:25 The Saints miss a 55-yard field-goal attempt. Niners' ball at their 45. 3:29 Kaepernick runs into a sack on second down and throws five feet over Aaron Burbridge's head on third-and-12. Niners go three-and-out. 3:38 Brees throws a 33-yard pass that bounces off the back of Brock's left shoulder and into the hands of Michael Thomas. Touchdown. 38-23 Saints. 3:45 Niners go three-and-out in 12 seconds. Record? 3:57 The Saints kick a 41-yard field goal with 8:52 left. 41-23 Saints. 4:04 Kaepernick drops a low snap on fourth-and-5. Saints' ball at their 8.

Reply jomammasophat says: November 6, 2016 at 3:31 pm LOL Reply red says: November 6, 2016 at 11:21 am He may not choose to leave but Jed should fire Kelly regardless. Probably won't happen though and sadly, I won't be surprised if the Yorks hang onto Baalke as well... They don't want to roam outside of their comfy zone while continuing to make an empty promise that "they're confident in Trent's new plan to bring home their 6th super bowl banner in 2017.” Sure thing, Jed. Reply Shoup says: November 6, 2016 at 11:47 am Not sure this means much. 1. Coaches always deny wanting to leave. 2. It may not matter if the team keeps playing this way. Though I don't see the Yorks paying for 3 coaches next year. 3. I think Kelly is in the midst of a power play with Baalke the end result being he or Baalke will leave. Reply Whine Country says: November 6, 2016 at 11:50 am The rumor is false because Kelly is too smart to let "sources close to” him know what he is really thinking, unless those sources could be trusted to keep quiet. My prediction is that the stars will line up and it will be in the York's and Kelly's interest to mutually part ways. That won't come until near or after the end of the season. This is about saving face and moving on. Kelly will speak to Jed re next year and say that he is totally committed to staying BUT, if Jed wants to take the team in another direction – well – Kelly will gladly voluntarily move on. It will be an offer that Jed can't refuse. Oregon fans will already have assured Chip that there is no financial downside and he can move on without burning any NFL bridges. Reply Whine Country says: November 6, 2016 at 11:52 am ...and I also predict that none of this will be in writing! Reply sebnynah says: November 6, 2016 at 12:34 pm WC, if Kaep leaves because of Baalke, I bet Chip will bail. Why would he stay here? He will have no QB, mediocre WRs, a fragile RB, ST LBs, and marshmallow safeties. Oregon will pay him well, but more importantly, they will treat him well. Reply Razoreater says: November 6, 2016 at 11:55 am The rumor is false because Kelly is too smart... You lost me right there.... Reply Whine Country says: November 6, 2016 at 12:30 pm I didn't say Kelly was smart. I said he was too smart to do something as stupid as discussing the matter with someone he couldn't trust. Reply Ralph Bedwell says: November 6, 2016 at 1:52 pm Kelly is smart. Reply hacksaw 46 says: November 6, 2016 at 11:52 am Grant, I am counting on you, no 9er TV for me.

Reply undercenter says: November 6, 2016 at 12:06 pm Really hard to pick the Niners without looking stupid – Niners 34 Saints 31. Reply Cassie Baalke says: November 6, 2016 at 12:19 pm Wonder how position and coaching grades will begin shaping up 3 hrs from now... Reply sebnynah says: November 6, 2016 at 12:25 pm I am content. On the KNBR pregame show, they brought up the fact that Baalke signed a former Saint and Patriot for intel from a future opponent. Too bad he is also an ACL player. Typical Baalke. Reply sebnynah says: November 6, 2016 at 12:28 pm Niners will win if Kaep can outscore Breeze. Both defenses are suspect. Kaep should not worry about the score. He should just concentrate on converting third downs and scoring TDs, not field goals. Chip needs to be bold. Reply Whine Country says: November 6, 2016 at 12:32 pm The storm or the breeze huh Seb? Reply sebnynah says: November 6, 2016 at 12:35 pm I want a Typhoon. Reply Cassie Baalke says: November 6, 2016 at 4:10 pm Seb, was Chip bold today? Reply sebnynah says: November 6, 2016 at 6:08 pm Yep, he went for it on 4th and 1. Too bad it failed. Niners need to have a 1 yard play and practice it until it is second nature. They did settle for field goals, but I think it was 4th and long, so it was justifiable, but I just wish he had a- Damn The Torpedoes- attitude.

The goal so very elastic, based on claims fantastic. Slick presentations, and proclamations couched in language bombastic. I've deployed many dark arts. Simulations and Gantt Charts. All to no avail, my project will fail. I may as well be throwing darts. My project, like shifting sand, is starting to get out of hand. Despite all attempts it still makes no sense.

Reply sebnynah says: November 6, 2016 at 6:14 pm Hmm, the Saints were deceptive. Like the Breeze passes that allowed the WR to fight for the ball, maybe the Niners could learn about how being deceptive can make their opponent make a mistake. I hope Kaep and Patton sync up more.

Reply Coffee's For Closers says: November 6, 2016 at 2:04 pm It's a shame they don't have an athletic QB that could fake the inside hand off and run the naked boot on 4th and 1. A true shame.

Reply Darren5000 says: November 6, 2016 at 2:03 pm I think they're ignoring Chip and he's lost the locker room. The goon throwing to antoher goon is not working for the 49ers. Can we have a Ponder?

Reply Coffee's For Closers says: November 6, 2016 at 2:07 pm Are you taking credit for "predicting” that the Saints would score on their next possession? Impressive I mean after they came out and scored two quick TD's nobody in their right mind would conceive they might get another one relatively quick as well. You're a regular sage.

Reply Dust Mite says: November 6, 2016 at 2:06 pm What exactly does the 49ers defense actually practice during the week? Has O'Neil heard about gap integrity? Reply TomD says: November 6, 2016 at 2:06 pm Darren 5000, your 21-3 prediction beat Seb's storm prediction, but I don't see you boasting like Seb! Reply Darren5000 says: November 6, 2016 at 2:08 pm I didn't make an actual prediction other then saints win. But if the 49ers were a good D red zone prevent team out there, it could've been 17 to 3 or FG blocked, but I know what the D was so I knew Saints would score and it's 21 to 3. I would say actual score: Saints 35 as they score in the 30s, 49ers 9, they miss the 2 point conversation, score near the end of 4th quarter.

Reply sebnynah says: November 6, 2016 at 5:26 pm Kaep throws for 398 and 2 TDs, and you all are dissing him for losing the game? How about that rush defense? I swear to God I saw players jump out of their gaps just as the RB runs through them. It was a shameful performance, and will likely set new records in failures. Like Devey last season, the Niners may not win another game with Bellore as ILB. Kaep did not play a complete game, but I also saw players on a different page and several drops. I am encouraged. I actually saw Kaep on the move, and he was deadly accurate. Kinda like the Sundance Kid. In the second half, they contained him in the pocket, and I did not see any rollouts. I even saw a play I advocated before. Torrey ran 5 steps, did a double move, and took off down the right side line. Too bad the DB was reading his eyes. I had advocated that Kaep look to the left, pump fake left, then point left. Then he should have heaved it down the right side line and let Torrey fight for the ball. The defense was on the field for over 70 snaps. They must have more 3 and outs if they want to rest more. Breeze surgically eviscerated the Niner secondary. Some of the receivers looked uncovered, but go ahead and blame Kaep. The best defense is a good offense. If not for those fumbles, especially the one on the 1 yard line, they could have been competitive. The best offense is a good defense. With a putrid defense, even the best offense will fail eventually. Sigh, guess the Niners officially suck. I blame Baalke, for not trying to improve even with 45 mil in cap space. I hope Baalke is fired on the team bus. Reply Cassie Baalke says: November 6, 2016 at 5:35 pm Yup...Sundance Kid... Wonder how the Kid would have covered that fumble... Reply eMJay says: November 6, 2016 at 5:36 pm I could have gone out there and put up 250 on that horrific defense. It was all run after the catch. Kaep is god awful and one outlier game does not a good quarterback make. Nice of you to ignore the int, the fumbles, the sacks, the drive killing mistakes and negative plays.

When they allowed him to roll out, he made plays. However, he was not consistent. The Niners need to make adjustments in the second half. I am really happy that DuJuan Harris is finally getting a chance to play. He looks elusive. Even though I am an ardent fan of Kaep, I still think that Chip should make the QB position competitive. Let Kaep start, but once they turn it over, let Gabbert or Ponder take the snaps, and he would continue to start as long as they keep scoring. It would reward success, and any team on a 7 game losing streak should be desperate enough to do it. Reply Prime Time says: November 6, 2016 at 5:48 pm You are a fruit cake! I am heartened? Get serious! Reply sebnynah says: November 6, 2016 at 5:59 pm Prime, we all saw what could happen if Kaep has more than a nanosecond to throw. I am a fan. I will not engage in schadenfreude like the others. The Niners can build on this loss. Even the run game was productive, so I actually think they could be competitive if they sat Bellore. Get a couch potato. Get an UDFA. Poach a practice squad player. Start Skov, I thought he was stout against the run, and he was only weak in the passing plays. Reply Prime Time says: November 6, 2016 at 6:04 pm I also saw the inaccuracy! The poor leadership and body language when he and his teammates made mistakes. We also witnessed that when a defense gives you no other option but to throw in the pocket and fit the ball in tight windows or outside the numbers he could not execute. Poe Parrot, don't insult the blog anymore. We all know #7 is limited. No more of your horse crap! Reply sebnynah says: November 6, 2016 at 6:23 pm Kaep throws for 398 yards, and you diss him. Rip the defense, they were the real reason they lost. Tim Ryan was actually parroting me when he talked about making Kaep more mobile. It was hillarious that he tried so hard to avoid any mention of gap integrity, but he was pinpointing the problem when he talked about the huge holes they ran through. Reply Prime Time says: November 6, 2016 at 6:31 pm The TD passes? Was that because of CK or 2 guys out running the D? How about the INT? How about late in the game and you need your QB to move the chains and he comes out with three terrible throws? As for Tim Ryan and your ridiculous theory about rolling him out, that's why defenses have defensive ends dummy! To keep the QB in the pocket and make him throw from there. Eventually you will have to do it! You are a Parrot! Poe Parrot! sebnynah says: November 6, 2016 at 9:54 pm No, that is called being shaped by your opponent. #80 says: November 6, 2016 at 6:03 pm seb, Last night I said Kap would have his best game. He looked good at times but still bad at times. Overall he exceded my expectations today. However, My prediction was predictable because they were playing the Saints. My prediction for next week is just as predictable. They are playing Arizona. Kap will be under pressure throughout and will have his worst game of the year. I not exactly sure but didn't Az get 8 sacks on us last time? That was with Gabbert and his quick throws. Giving up 10 sacks is actually realistic this time. Kaps career could be over next week. Reply Coffee's for Closers® says: November 6, 2016 at 6:05 pm Not hard for an NFL QB to put up ok stats against the 28th ranked passing defense. Reply Rebuild A Winner says: November 6, 2016 at 6:26 pm You play what's on the schedule. Against an NFL team right? Just like Prescott who played the Browns. Kaep played pretty decent today. Was not the reason why they lost. Reply Prime Time says: November 6, 2016 at 6:36 pm He's average. Mediocre at best. You won't win many games in this league with a so so QB. Unless you have an all world supporting cast. See 85 Bears! Trent Dilfer and Bucks 2001! Reply Rebuild A Winner says: November 6, 2016 at 6:41 pm Well there Prime he has a all world Pathetic supporting cast. The Browns have a much better supporting cast then the Niners. Prior and Coleman are much better WRs then our joke of a core. Prime Time says: November 6, 2016 at 6:51 pm Yes terrible supporting cast but the skill set hasn't changed. Accuracy, leadership and precision passing still is limited! Rebuild A Winner says: November 6, 2016 at 6:55 pm They need to blow this team up.. I agree with what you said though especially about leadership! We need a new face of this franchise! Coffee's for Closers® says: November 6, 2016 at 6:36 pm What's your point with what I said? He did what most QB's in the league should be able to do against a defense of that caliber. That's quite an accomplishment for a 5th year player appearing in his 61st game. Totally comparable in situation to a rookie appearing in his 8th game. You guys never learn. Sad. Reply Rebuild A Winner says: November 6, 2016 at 6:39 pm He has nothing around him Coffee. His starting RB was a guy from the streets. Pretty decent find but still a no buddy. His receivers are a joke. This team is a joke. He played a little better then decent today. Showed some signs of the 2012 Kaep IMO. Doc says: November 6, 2016 at 7:56 pm Winner, Kap had plenty of tallent arround him and I dissagree, he played subpar today which is about as consistant in the last season Jim Harbaugh was coach. Kap is not an NFL permier QB. sebnynah says: November 6, 2016 at 6:15 pm 80, you may be right. :( Reply AES says: November 6, 2016 at 6:22 pm I would love to see Gore inducted as a 49er. But Gore wasn't too happy with the FO treatment of Harbaugh and not resigning Iupoti who played an integral part to opening running lanes for him. CFC, maybe you could save a seat at the induction ceremony for Grant who will be wearing a "he's got no legs” tee-shirt. Reply #80 says: November 6, 2016 at 6:31 pm AES, We lost our identity when Gore and Harbaugh parted ways with the team. https://mobile.twitter.com/CoachJim4UM/status/692030009809227776/photo/1 Reply AES says: November 6, 2016 at 7:39 pm 80, Agreed. But Jed & Trent tossed salt on the wound by saying that the team could win with Tomsula. What a joke! I wouldn't be surprised if Kelly jumps ship after the season. What Jed Trent have done to our team is unacceptable. Reply Darren5000 says: November 6, 2016 at 5:40 pm I agree on arizona. going to be a big win for them. Reply Detroit9er says: November 6, 2016 at 5:46 pm Balke needs to be canned. I've never seen such incompetence in a GM in any sport. Correct me if I'm wrong but has any other GM completely whiffed on an entire draft before(2012)? Not only is there no one on that draft on the niners still, but I don't believe any of them are even in the NFL now. Not to be Captain Obvious, but we axed the wrong guy (Harbaugh) Reply Coffee's for Closers® says: November 6, 2016 at 6:06 pm I wonder if Chad Kelly's injury will have an effect on how many of the Junior QB prospects stay for their senior year. Reply Scooter_McG says: November 6, 2016 at 6:22 pm Not sure if Kelly's injury specifically will lead to it, but my expectation atm is that most (though unlikely all) of the underclassmen QBs being discussed as potential first through third round picks will declare (Watson, Kizer, Kaaya, Falk, Trubisky, Mahomes, Rudolph). Reply #80 says: November 6, 2016 at 7:14 pm Patton career high 6 catches 106 Yds. He is Kaps go to guy. Kerley has become a non factor with Kap at QB.
