"We had two events on Saturday (June 6) that were both very extremely peaceful. I was proud how everybody acted and exercised their First Amendment rights to rally and protest," he said.Safety Director Tom Weinreich added, "With respect to Police Chief (Joseph) Bobak and the men and women in our police department, I'm proud of how they handled the whole situation, ensuring the safety of the protesters and community at large, as well as contributing to the atmosphere that kept the demonstration peaceful.”The first event on Saturday morning was spearheaded by the UAW's Civil Rights Committee. The protest showing support for the Floyd family took place at the UAW Local 1005 union hall on Chevrolet Boulevard.DeGeeter was among numerous political leaders who spoke at the UAW hall."UAW had union leadership speak, including the head of its civil rights committee, as well as the plant manager, who stood with UAW workers,” DeGeeter said. "That was a really neat moment."There's a good history between management and the UAW in Parma. I think that's one of the many things that have made the plant a successful place to work," he said.In the afternoon, a different group of protesters marched from Zielinski Park to Parma City Hall before ending up at the Parma Justice Center."I was at City Hall when the folks marched down Ridgewood Drive,” DeGeeter said. "I came out when they stopped right at the steps of City Hall and chanted. They were there for a very short duration while our police department monitored traffic at the intersection of Ridge Road and Ridgewood Drive."Then our police blocked off traffic and allowed the protesters to march on Ridgewood Drive to West 54th Street and safely get to the Justice Center.”Once word reached city hall about the planned protests, the decision was made to keep the events off Parma's official social media pages."That came from Chief Bobak, and we agreed with him,” DeGeeter said. "We didn't want some folks who would come down and maybe try to cause some problems and not allow the protests to go on."It worked out. We didn't have problems. Everything was peaceful. I was very proud for our city that we had two events and no issues. That hasn't been the case in other cities, unfortunately.”As far as the national movement regarding racial inequality, DeGeeter said his message to the public stems from a conversation he had with his family."Racism and hatred are taught,” DeGeeter said. "It's learned. I had an interesting chat the night before (the protests) with my daughter. I had to explain to her what happened. The 8 minutes and 46 seconds really sticks in your mind."It was just horrible what happened in Minneapolis. I think we need to find our moral compass again. I think we need to have strong conversations. That starts not just with adults, but also with our young kids on this to change the behaviors and the mindsets of some of the folks in our country.”Read more news from the Parma Sun Post.
