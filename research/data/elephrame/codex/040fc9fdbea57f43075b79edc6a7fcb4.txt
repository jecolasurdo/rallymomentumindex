Others were seen spray-painting a statue of George Washington.A little before 6:30 p.m., a few people jumped on a police car and another kicked it, causing some damage.Later, as tensions were palpably rising outside the first police precinct, protestors slashed the tires on a police car, and the loud sound frightened those nearby.

Some stuck cars are trying to get around protestors. One just tried to speed straight through, people norrowly missed getting hit— Michael Sol Warren (@MSolDub) May 30, 2020 Punches were thrown during a small incident that appeared to die down quickly. Police were not involved. Though police officers were present throughout the demonstration area, they were observed not engaging with protestors. In one moment, a police officer and two activists were spotted posing together for a photo.A few punches were thrown among activists and a crowd started running. It died down fairly quickly.
