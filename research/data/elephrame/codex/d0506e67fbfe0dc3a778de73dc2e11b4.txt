Protesters said it was a peaceful event, but one of the marchers was arrested by San Jose police. By Eric Kurhi | Bay Area News GroupPUBLISHED: July 10, 2016 at 2:02 p.m. | UPDATED: August 12, 2016 at 12:13 a.m.SAN JOSE — More than 60 protesters marched through downtown streets Sunday evening, ending up in front of City Hall, where many of them laid on the ground in a "die-in” after recent police shootings of civilians in Minnesota and Louisiana. Protesters, some of whom identified themselves as members of the Black Lives Matter movement, said one of the group's leaders was arrested as he tried to rally marchers back toward the City Hall plaza. "He was telling everyone to turn around and head back here, and they tackled him,” said Marisa Balderas. "Four officers tackled him and, yeah, he got hurt.” Balderas and other protesters urged the group to maintain a peaceful protest amid heightened tensions nationwide over the deaths of black civilians at the hands of police officers. Recent protests in Minnesota and Louisiana have ended in violence. The controversy over police brutality took a dark turn Thursday when a gunman opened fire on police officers in Dallas, killing five. Thousands marched in Oakland that night, shutting down Interstate 880. Rhonda, a protester in San Jose who declined to give her last name, said that "everybody should be fed up” with police violence against black people. "We're not going to take this anymore,” she said. "You don't need to know the black and brown men personally who are being shot down in the streets. This is a revolution.” San Jose police did not immediately respond Sunday evening to a request for comment on the protest. Contact Eric Kurhi at 408-920-5852. Follow him at Twitter.com/erickurhi.
