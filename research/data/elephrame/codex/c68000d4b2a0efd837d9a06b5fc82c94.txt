About 200 people gathered and marched in Hyde Park and Kenwood Wednesday night, marching through the neighborhood and ending a short time after gathering in front of the Obama family home.

A fence placed by police and a sizable police force on bikes and on foot blocked protesters from going up to his house. Advertisement "We do appreciate what our president has done thus far. We believe he has done the best he could, but we are out here to help him out by demanding that he end the war on black and brown lives across America," said activist and organizer of the event, Jedidiah Brown. "Tonight we are going to be articulate. We are going to be respectful, and we are going to be effective." Community leaders like Brown, who spoke through a bullhorn in between chants underlined that the purpose of this protest was not about a few shooting victims but about a system set up against black people, from mass incarceration to health care to employment. William Calloway of Christian Aire, a faith based organization, said that in the past five years there have been 306 police shootings by The Chicago Police Department. "This isn't just an Eric Garner issue," Calloway said. "This is not just a Mike Brown issue. It's a Chicago issue." Tio Hardiman, CEO of Violence Interrupters, named three demands specific to Chicago, including the firing of Commander Evans, who he said has 51 counts of excessive police force, the establishment of a grassroots independent police review authority and monthly police accountability meetings. "It's good to see a diversity of voices out here," Hardiman said. "Change is needed in the police policy structure." Just as Obama has worked to end wars abroad, Rich Kohng, head pastor at the Ninth Hour said, "We're asking him to declare a truce on our own people." Earlier, about four dozen demonstrators gathered Wednesday afternoon at Michigan Avenue and Congress Parkway to speak out against U.S. involvement in the Middle East. Protesters held banners and signs, including one that read "No more wars for U.S. empire!" Andy Thayer of Gay Liberation Network began speaking on the deaths of Mike Brown and Eric Garner. "This originally started off as a protest to U.S. violence overseas, the systemic violence of U.S. militarism around the world," Thayer said. "But with the events in Ferguson and New York, which were just the tip of the iceberg ... we thought it was very important to connect the issues," Thayer said. Among the speakers was Joyce Brown, whose son Charles Brown, 20, was shot and killed by Harvey police in April. Advertisement "No one can feel the pain I feel right now, and no one can take it away," Brown said. "My son had so much to live for. He wasn't a gangbanger. He mentored young black men." Brown said investigators are still in the discovery phase of her son's case, but she is discouraged about possible charges after the decisions in other police-involved homicides. "In New York, in Ferguson, there were investigations and nothing happened," she said. "I was mainly saddened for the family." She said police misidentified her son as a crime suspect. At the time of the death she was at her grandson's christening. It wasn't until the next day, after searching for her son all night, that police told her he was dead. After marching north to Michigan and Wacker, protesters staged a die-in. The maneuver was short-lived, as a police official on a Segway threatened them with arrest. Two people were arrested for obstructing traffic as a result, said Chicago Police News Affairs Officer Hector Alfaro. Dec. 10 commemorates the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations General Assembly. It has been celebrated internationally since 1950. A few dozen faculty, staff and students from Chicago Theological Seminary marched and chanted for an hour in Hyde Park on Wednesday evening after holding a vigil in memory of black men killed by police.

"We first of all want to stand in solidarity with the people who are recognizing that we are at a crucial tipping point," said the Rev. Alice Hunt, president of Chicago Theological Seminary on why the event was organized. "Also because we mourn the murder of Michael Brown and Eric Garner and Tamir Rice and the many, many countless others. And we mourn for the terrible consequences of unbridled abuse of power and unchecked white privilege." The seminary's students of all religions and nationalities have been greatly affected by these tragedies, said Lisa Goods, Director of Community Life at the seminary. Goods said she is disappointed that more churches that are not predominantly African-American have not been involved in recent protests.

"And that's why I am so pleased with this institution, where it is students, faculty and staff and people of all races, religions and nationalities who have joined together." As attendees lit candles, Goods read a list of names of black men who have been killed by police before professors spoke. "This is a moment that could change us," according to Rabbi Rachel Mikva, a professor of Jewish studies. "At the time of Advent in the Christian tradition, the approach of Hanukkah in the Jewish tradition, the approach of Kwanzaa in the African-American tradition, we know it is possible to shine a light in darkness. We have to make sure this moment is not lost. We have to make sure everybody in America gets it." Protests against police violence have sprung up across the country in past weeks, spurred by recent announcements that charges would not be filed against two officers in separate cases of police killing unarmed black men. Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren Wilson was not indicted after fatally shooting teenager Michael Brown, and New York City police officer Daniel Pantaleo will not be charged in the death of Eric Garner. Chicago activists say the incidents highlighted the tense relationships between local police and minority communities. Homicide Crime Barack Obama Segway Inc.
