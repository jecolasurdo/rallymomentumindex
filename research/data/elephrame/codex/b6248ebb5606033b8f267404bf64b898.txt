Campbell soon emerged from the apartment with his back toward officers and put his hands behind his head. He was struck with one beanbag-shotgun round and ran toward a parked car as an officer fired another five beanbag rounds. Frashour fired a single shot as Campbell ran, killing him.Frashour said at the time that he thought Campbell was reaching for a gun, but investigators concluded he was unarmed.A grand jury declined to indict Frashour on criminal charges. They attributed Campbell's death to critical police errors, including no central command, a lack of communication between officers and training that taught officers how to shoot without key decision-making skills.The Portland Police Association filed a grievance challenging the termination and the case was reviewed by an arbitrator. The arbitrator determined the city did not have enough cause to fire Frashour and ordered in 2012 that the city rehire him. The state Employment Relations Board also ordered Portland to reinstate Frashour after the police union filed a complaint with the agency when the city did not reverse the termination.Portland Mayor Charlie Hales said in a statement that he was disappointed with the appeals court ruling and that Frashour will go through training again when he returns to the police force. His assignment after the reorientation training will be determined at a later date."Portland Police Bureau training emphasizes de-escalation, and while the vast majority of our officers perform exceptionally well, incidents like the tragic death of Aaron Campbell undermine that success," Hales said in the statement.A protest of the appeals court ruling is planned outside of Portland City Hall at 11:30 a.m. on Thursday. Members of the Albina Ministerial Alliance Coalition for Justice and Police Reform, which is organizing the event, say they will call for Frashour's new police department assignment to be one that requires the least possible amount of contact with the public.The group said in a statement that it stands by the city's decision to fire Frashour."The reinstatement of Frashour continues a long line of arbitration overturning firings of officers who wrongfully use deadly force, or otherwise take actions often targeted at communities of color," the alliance wrote.Read the Oregon Court of Appeals ruling-- Everton Bailey Jr.ebailey@oregonian.com503-221-8343; @EvertonBaileyNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).Â© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
