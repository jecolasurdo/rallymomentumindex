Speakers at Saturday's event said his family described Floyd as a gentle giant. His friends called him "Big Floyd.”Speakers who joined a crowd of thousands — holding posters with messages such as "No Justice, No Peace,” "Black Lives Matter” and "Jail Killer Cops” — shared experiences with racism and police brutality. Two sisters talked about the importance of race-based information to combat systemic racism. There was also talk on allyship, action and community.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedSpeakers rallied several thousand Calgarians filling Olympic Plaza in Calgary for a Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday, June 6, 2020. Gavin Young/Postmedia /Gavin Young/PostmediaEbony Gooden, a deaf black woman, drew attention to accessibility."I'm scared because I was in the march last Wednesday. Many of you here were in that march but I was the only black deaf woman there. I'm the only black deaf woman in Calgary,” Gooden's interpreter relayed to the crowd."When we were chanting, I was standing there not knowing the words. I didn't know what was happening. I could feel my anger. I could feel my grief. I could feel my fear and then an interpreter showed up. Just showed up.”That changed everything for her.More On This Topic'Division is not the answer': Thousands gather for anti-racism protest through downtown CalgaryAnti-racism protests the start to a growing 'revolution' in Calgary and beyondCalgary anti-racism protests a defining moment for city, organizers and experts say"Then I could feel like my anger was part of the entire room's anger, the entire group's anger.

Meanwhile, black people continue to face injustice and feel anger and fear."I know a lot of times we have a short attention span and as soon as you leave here, it's done. But we have to continue. We have to push through. We have to scream. We have to get this done. We have to make this change,” she said."I am black and I am proud,” the first speaker told the crowd."I will not be filled with anger,” she continued. "Ignorance was bliss but not anymore. The inequality and unfairness has been going on for 400 years. For my generation, it started with Trayvon Martin.”AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedMartin was a 17-year-old in Florida who was fatally shot while walking home from a convenience store.Many of those marching in Calgary, and more broadly across Canada, have drawn attention to missing and murdered Indigenous women, violence perpetuated by the police against people of colour, and systemic racism that permeates society.Change can look different depending on who you speak with, but many say it starts with simply listening to the black community and collectively working toward an equitable world."It's beautiful to see this many people want to speak out about the issues, but we need to be constantly taking actions to help,” said organizer Ninotchka Pierre Pierre.AdvertisementStory continues belowThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.Article content continuedSeveral thousand Calgarians filled Olympic Plaza in Calgary for a Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday, June 6, 2020. Gavin Young/Postmedia /Gavin Young/Postmedia"We need to be signing petitions, donating toward causes, especially because in the United States it's gotten so bad, as well as in Canada, for black and Indigenous folks.”For vigil organizer Adora Nwofor, the movement is about humanizing black lives instead of black deaths."Everybody is desensitized to it and it's only increasing, so what we want is to humanize ourselves, our community, and talk about people in their wholeness,” said Nwofor."Black people don't exist as you feel like they should. There are all kinds of black people. We exist all kinds of ways and we should be respected in all of our manifestations.”Several thousand Calgarians filled Olympic Plaza in Calgary for a Black Lives Matter rally on Saturday, June 6, 2020. /Gavin Young/PostmediaCommunity leaders say the protests are a "defining moment” for Calgary and the start of a growing revolution that demands justice, freedom and equality.Protests in Calgary have, so far, been peaceful.Tear gas was used by police against protesters in Montreal.
