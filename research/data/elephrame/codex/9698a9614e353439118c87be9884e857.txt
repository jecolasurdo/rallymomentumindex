The demonstration's goal was to "peacefully protest the senseless, racist killing of George Floyd and the persistent racism in our country,” according to the event page on Facebook. Organizers Ashley Hopwood Farrar and Maria McMorrow urged attendees to stay on the Rolling Fatties property, stay out of the road, wear face coverings and maintain social distancing as much as possible. Farrar made an informational post in the Kingfield Community Forum group on Facebook Tuesday, June 2, stating their intentions of holding a peaceful protest. The comments on the post turned hostile quickly, with threatening remarks including "just don't block the road! I won't even attempt to stop!” Others stated their support of the demonstration, thanking Farrar for organizing the event. The post was removed after several hours. "My sister-in-law, who's black, heard about the anger from other community members and said to me, "welcome to being black, where people hate you for no reason.” I feel like the last 48 hours have shown me a taste of what she and other people of color face regularly and it is scary,” Farrar said at the protest.

My morning was full of westerly winds, pairs of loons and campfire breakfast sandwiches. And then I turned on the radio,” McMorrow said at the protest. "I will never understand what it is like to be Black in this country, and I don't have a playbook for what anti-racist activism looks like in a rural, predominantly white place. But we cannot pretend that racism is 'a city problem' or 'a southern problem' or 'a manufactured problem.' "After the first step of admitting that racism is real and it is here, I am asking myself and my community — what are we doing about it? If you are afraid to do the wrong thing, read and listen. Look to what Black people and Black organizations have been demanding all along. Listen to their experiences. Talk to your young children about race and racism in the present tense. Read the Maine Wabanaki-State Child Welfare Truth and Reconciliation Commission report. Learn about the Penobscot land here in this valley. I don't have all the answers, but the best experts are people of color living in Maine, and they are already speaking. Listen more.” Following McMorrow's speech, the attendees knelt for eight minutes and 46 seconds of silence, the length of time that the Minneapolis police officer knelt on George Floyd's neck. "If that felt like an eternity, that's because it is,” McMorrow said as the group rose. Officers from the Franklin County Sheriff's Office and the State Police were in the area to support the peace. Medics and first aid providers were also in attendance. The decision was made to end the demonstration at 6:30 p.m. so the protesters could leave as a strong, unified body. "I was so impressed and moved by the number of people who showed up. We proved that a protest can be peaceful. It was a moving and empowering event,” Farrar said afterwards. 96354 false false true false true true false auto false ease-in-out 300 false 0 true false Previous (Left arrow key) Next (Right arrow key) %curr% of %total% More From Front Page Go To The Front Page SectionThis Week's CoverCOVID-19 in Maine: More businesses allowed to openCOVID-19 in Maine: Civil emergency extended Leave a Reply Cancel replyYour email address will not be published.
