(Stephanie Maksin | For NJ Advance Media) By Bill Evans | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com The Penns Grove High School football team became the latest to kneel for the national anthem as a way of bringing attention to injustices felt by minorities in the United States.Coach John Emel said about half the team kneeled for the anthem prior to Penns Grove's 20-8 victory over Salem on Saturday. The week before in a loss at Haddon Heights, Emel said a few players sat on the bench.Shortly prior to the game Saturday, Emel approved a request by several players who wanted to kneel. He said he would talk about the issue with the team on Monday to let them know whatever they choose to do forward, it is a personal choice.Penns Grove is a diverse team, but Emel said the players who stood and the players who kneeled weren't broken down along racial lines.STILL KNEELING: Support inspires Wilson"I think what I felt is some of the kids just took a knee because they saw other kids taking a knee and thought everyone was doing it,” said Emel, who is white. "So I want to talk about it so next week (against Palmyra) it's a little more organized. I want them to do whatever they feel comfortable doing. I don't want anyone to feel pressured. I want my players to know they have my support.”San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started the trend by sitting then kneeling for the anthem in preseason games. It led to more professional athletes making the same statement, followed by the Woodrow Wilson football team kneeling for the anthem before its opener on Sept. 10 in Camden.The choice by Wilson coach Preston Brown and the Tigers became a national story, and Brown said this week he would continue to kneel because of the support he has received to do so."If it's something you feel strongly about, then you should do it,” said Emel. "It's a right this country affords us. We're a public school. We say the Pledge of Allegiance every day and you either stand or sit quietly. As long as you do it respectfully, you have the right to make that decision. And that's what I told my players Saturday, do it respectfully."The thing I took out of the Woodrow Wilson situation was two players were able to stand comfortably and not feel pressured to kneel.”A few Barringer players and coaches kneeled for the anthem on Friday night.Emel said he continued to stand for the anthem, but said he would have rknelt if his players needed him to support them by kneeling. He also said he would kneel if he knew it would continue dialogue and bring about change."I'm a social studies teacher, and we talk about current events,” said Emel. "Kids identify with the issues in the country people are concerned with. We're not afraid to have discussions. Myself, I'm a little discouraged with some of the things going on in this country the last week. Honestly, it's been disheartening."I support dialogue, activity, bringing about change. If my kneeling does that, I'll do it in a heartbeat. We have issues in this country, issues in Penns Grove and Carney's Point. But as Preston said, the important thing is what's next. Where do we go from here?”Bill Evans can be reached at bevans@njadvancemedia.com or by leaving a note in the comments below. Follow him on Twitter @BEvansSports.
