Trump later blamed a faulty earpiece.Earlier in the day, at a Trump rally at Valdosta State University in Valdosta, Ga., USA TODAY reports, about 30 black students standing silently at the top of the bleachers were escorted out by security officials before he began speaking. Trump campaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks in an email late Monday night denied that the students were shown the door "at the request of the candidate” or the campaign.RELATED: Students removed from Trump rally in GeorgiaAt Radford, not all protesters did so with words. As many as 300 students participated in a silent "read-in," organized by the Racism and Reproductive Rights Awareness Project (RAP), according to its Facebook page. Scattered throughout the auditorium, they cracked open books and read while Trump spoke to show that his opinions should be disregarded.The Facebook post asked that people "bring a book, preferably by a woman of color. We are not hecklers nor are we disputing Trump's right to speak. We plan to show up and sit quietly, reading a book."Breanna Branscome, a sophomore at New River Community College in Dublin, Va., who traveled to Radford to attend the read-in protest, says she chose The Zahir by Paulo Coelho because it shows that racially diverse people can "enhance our society, as a whole. ... (Coelho) is very eloquent and enlightened, which is defense against Trump's arsenal of rudeness toward Hispanics.”Radford junior Lesly Pineda-Manzano, an undocumented student who attends school under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, who did not participate in the read-in, says Trump's visit to RU was "a slap in the face."Radford, she says, "claims to want diversity but allows such a hateful man to have ... a rally here.”Contributing: Kristen Rein, USA TODAY CollegeAmanda Florian is a Milligan College student a USA TODAY College correspondent.This story originally appeared on the USA TODAY College blog, a news source produced for college students by student journalists.
