A city medical examiner testified the choke hold triggered his death, while a medical examiner from St. Louis paid $2,000 by the defense said Garner's heart disease was "exacerbated by his interaction with law enforcement."Following the Justice Department's decision two-weeks ago to not bring federal charges against Pantaleo, supporters vowed to shut down city streets over the course of an 11-day protest.Police were called to Pantaleo's neighborhood at about 7:30 p.m. for a report of a large crowd.Officers reportedly cordoned off a street near the home before protestors arrived.Protesters were outside the Staten Island home of killer cop Daniel Pantaleo earlier today demanding justice for #EricGarner. NYPD got there before the protesters & literally put up a thin blue line to protect a killer cop from people demanding justice. #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/JNjE3Ewnw4— Ash J (@AshAgony) July 28, 2019 The protest was the second in Oakwood in as many weeks, after a July 18 march when Garner supporters vowed to "find” Pantaleo.Protesting RUMCOn Friday, a crowd bearing their message on t-shirts and banners gathered outside Richmond University Medical Center in West Brighton, where they protested an emergency responder whom they accuse of acting unprofessionally at the time of Garner's death.Video posted to Twitter that includes the responder's name shows a crowd shouting toward the hospital, that if action isn't taken toward the person, "We will f** be here, every day.”Protesters have entered the medical center and are being told by security they're on private property and cannot enter. They continue to march. pic.twitter.com/uNhdT9VHHn— Chloe K. Li 李嘉盈 (@ChloeKLis) July 26, 2019 De Blasio meets with Garner familyMayor de Blasio met with Garner's family at Gracie Mansion on July 18, after a mostly peaceful march outside the mayor's residence became physical as protesters and police shoved each other as cops tried prevent them from marching down York Ave.We put our faith in a federal process that dragged on for years.That won't happen again.We're different because of Eric Garner. https://t.co/4esjH33aES— Bill de Blasio (@BilldeBlasio) July 16, 2019 De Blasio said the following in regard to the meeting."Chirlane and I listened to their anguish and distrust coming through with each question. And we understood why those feelings were so deep-seated. We did our best to explain the exact steps ahead, leading to the final resolution of the NYPD process next month -- a process that will be fair and impartial,” de Blasio said in a statement after the meeting. "Speaking not only as mayor but as a father, I want to say this plainly: We all watched Eric Garner's dying words. They haunted this city and this nation. He should never have died.”City Hall has said that legally, the mayor cannot fire the officer himself or overrule the police commissioner's decision because city code and state law prevent him from doing so, even though he is O'Neill's boss.The same day the Mayor and his wife met with the family, organizers with Black Lives Matter tweeted at Mayor de Blasio that unless he fires Pantaleo, his "black card has been revoked."Pantaleo's long-awaited disciplinary trial came to an end more than a month ago and NYPD Commissioner of Trials Rosemarie Moldonado, is still working on a final recommendation in the case to give to Police Commissioner James O'Neill, who will have the final say in how to punish Pantaleo.A decision is expected at the end of August.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
