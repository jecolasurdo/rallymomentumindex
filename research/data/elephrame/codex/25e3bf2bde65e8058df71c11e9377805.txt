"We're here because we want change, and we're seeking justice for George Floyd and any of the black lives who have been lost to police brutality," organizer Laurie Avila, of Sugar Grove said. Many signs held by protesters on both sides of Route 71 featured the names of African Americans, including Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, Sandra Bland and Tamir Rice, who died during encounters with police. Protesters wearing masks practiced social distancing by spreading in a line along Route 71, stretching from one end of Oswego High School to the other and beyond. Oswego police were present at the rally, parked across the street in the East View Academy parking lot. Deputy Police Kevin Norwood said the department was alerted to the rally the previous day through social media and reached out to the organizers. "Obviously we want to make sure the event is peaceful for everybody and protect the safety of all participants," Norwood said. "Our goal, any time that we have citizens that want to have some type of an event to convey their thoughts on something, exercise their First Amendment, we want that event to be safe for all people involved," said Police Chief Jeff Burgner. "We've had very good interaction with the organizer of this event and I can tell you from watching how this group has carried themselves has been very impressive," Burgner said. "They've been very respectful. I see them social distancing in this time of COVID. They've been very peaceful, and that is what was conveyed to us and it has made this event, I think, a success." When asked what prompted the Oswego rally, Avila said that she and many others were unable to attend rallies and protests in Chicago to show their support. "We wanted to have a more local one to recognize our community and so that people are able to show their support and protest," she said. "We want the message that things need to change," Avila said. "Things aren't okay the way that they are. Obviously, racism is still here today, and a lot of it is with our justice system and especially in a community like ours it's important to speak up because I know that there can be a lot of issues going on in our community in particular. "We need change, and it's really important. I want people to have a voice even if they can't make it to Chicago, whether it be they don't have a ride, or I know younger people - a lot of parents aren't okay with them going to Chicago because of possible dangers or any other reason. "I want people to be able to have a voice," she said.
