Activists protest at Homewood City Hall after woman searched, detained at Walmart - al.com Skip to ArticleBirmingham Real-Time NewsActivists protest at Homewood City Hall after woman searched, detained at Walmart Updated Jan 13, 2019; Posted Dec 05, 2016 By Carol Robinson | crobinson@al.com FrankProtestPhoto.PNGFrank Matthews and several others lay on the floor of Homewood City Hall Monday, Dec. 5, 2016, in protest of a woman's detention during a felony theft investigation at Walmart on Dec. 1.Protesters angry over what they claim was mistreatment of a black woman wrongly detained by Homewood police during a felony theft investigation at Walmart took their concerns to City Hall on Monday.Frank Matthews, president of the Outcast Voters League, and three others lay down on the floor of the lobby at Homewood City Hall for 30 minutes, which is how long they say 59-year-old Brenda Rivers was handcuffed in the Lakeshore store Dec. 1 before she was released without being charged. Multiple people videotaped the incident, and that video quickly was viewed by hundreds of thousands of people."Where is the mayor," Matthews chanted from the floor. "Come out, come out wherever you are."Mayor Scott McBrayer was not at City Hall at the time. "The Mayor's Office doesn't comment on ongoing investigations," McBrayer said. "It's just not appropriate to do so before all the facts are known."On Friday, Homewood police held a press conference during which Lt. Eric Hampton apologized on behalf of the department and said investigations are underway. Matthews said the apology wasn't good enough. "We was not happy with that watered-down, milquetoast, cake mix apology," he said. "That's some Duncan Hines cake mix apology for a black woman being body slammed in Walmart with a 10-year-old girl seeing it done and we're supposed to be satisfied.""The mayor needs to apologize publicly, Mr. Rogue Cop needs to be fired and apologize so maybe he can get another job, and the chief of police," Matthews said.Multiple cellphone videos captured Homewood police detaining Rivers after a shopper's wallet was stolen at the Lakeshore Parkway store about 8 p.m. The video- which lasts almost 30 minutes - shows officers with a woman handcuffed on the floor in one of the aisles and her husband's staunch defense of what he claimed was an unwarranted search and detention.Homewood police spokesman Sgt. John Carr said officers were dispatched to the store at 8 p.m. on a report of a wallet theft - which is a felony. When they arrived on the scene, the theft victim, who was shopping with her young daughter, told officers her wallet was taken out of her buggy while she was in the children's department.Carr said officers went to that department and stopped one female. She consented to a search of her purse and the victim's wallet was not inside. The officer then stopped Rivers, who is shown in the video in handcuffs. He said the officer explained to her that he was investigating a theft and asked her to remain there so the theft victim could come back there and tell police whether or not she was the woman who stole her wallet.The video indicates Rivers refused to let the officer search her purse. Police said she was detained for trying to leave the scene.Carr said Rivers refused to comply with the officers and was placed in handcuffs. Initially, there were only two officers on the scene. Supervisors requested to come to the scene were delayed because a Homewood officer was involved in a car crash nearby and they were still at the crash site.The detention caused quite a stir as a crowd gathered to watch unfolding scene. "I am a human being. Let me go," Rivers was seen saying repeatedly on the video. "So are you going to stop every black woman with a black jacket?""He just accused her," her husband said, claiming they had just entered the store moments before they were stopped. "He wanted to go through her purse without a search warrant or anything. Our rights are being infringed."Several people in the crowd said the victim of the theft had already said the woman in handcuffs was not the woman who stole her purse. Eventually, store employees brought the victim back to where the woman was being held by officers and said, "It's not her."Homewood police said the officers involved in the detention remain on duty, but said a detective is investigating the theft and Internal Affairs is investigating to determine whether the detention was within departmental policy. They are waiting for additional video from Walmart."What we would like to say, first and foremost, is we apologize for the negative encounter (Rivers) had with our agency, our officers," Hampton said at Friday's press conference. "They are good officers who want to a good job. We apologize not only to the Rivers' family, but to the shoppers and those inside the store who witnessed this event."Friday evening, Rivers' daughter, Monica Dawkins, joined protesters outside Walmart and said her mother was "violated" and had a right to deny the officer's request to check her purse. She is not pleased with how the incident is handled, and wants disciplinary action taken.Matthews on Monday said he was given the name of the officer involved in the Rivers' detention, but police have not confirmed that is indeed the name of one of the officers involved.Matthews said the officer has been on the force for less than a year.A Homewood resident named Laura Arteaga also spoke outside of City Hall Monday, and claimed Homewood police officers "body-slammed" her to the ground during a 2014 incident in which she was arrested for domestic violence against her husband. "They threw my beat and bruised body in a padded cell for three days on a hard cement floor," she claimed.Arteaga, also known as Laura Gonzalez, filed a lawsuit in June 2016 alleging officers physically and unreasonable assaulted and abused her and denied her medical treatment. The lawsuit was dismissed last month, court records show.Matthews said he will be back at Homewood City Hall Tuesday, this time with a makeshift jail. "We're starting 'Storming Homewood' and we're going to continue," he said. "In the words of Dr. King when they had to bring the protests to Birmingham, he said, 'We have to break the back of the bull in order to try to get a handle on this. There's a great chasm already in America. There's a great divide among the races."Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).Â© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
