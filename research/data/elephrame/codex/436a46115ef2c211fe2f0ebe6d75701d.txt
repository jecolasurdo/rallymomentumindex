Member of Ringling's Students of Color Alliance collaborated to hold a rally in support of the Black Lives Matter Movement and the main focus of the event was the de-militarization of police forces on the school's campus. The rally was attended by members of different ethnic backgrounds. "There's an intersection to being a POC in the real world especially in regards to the fact that you have non-black allies, you have non-brown allies, you have non-sys allies and it's just as important to use that privilege to try to help other people and then it shows that we as a community are growing together if we can stand together," Ringling College Junior Cyan Fearon said.
