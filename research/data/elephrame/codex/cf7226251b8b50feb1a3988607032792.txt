They occupied the area near the monument for most of the day, while those protesting against the monument stood across the street.Tempers flared at times as a crowd of about 200 gathered, but no one was arrested. Police and barricades separated the groups by placing them on opposite sides of the street.Local activist group Fighting Injustice Together organized the event. Travis Greene, president of the organization, said he wanted to raise awareness about the monument that has been in its current location near the gates of the cemetery since the 1920s."We're not asking that the monument be torn down," Greene said. "We just want it to be relocated to a different location which is at the Confederate museum."Greene said he will draw up a resolution and present it to city officials to have the monument relocated.FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInRally sparks debate and protest over Confederate monument downtown FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

She said she wanted people to respect Southern heritage and monuments. She said she was not at the rally to support racism."Yes, we lost the war, we know that,” Gagliardi said. "This is honoring our generals and history, to take this away is highly offensive.”Opponents of the monument included Black Lives Matter Upstate, Black Lives Matter Greenville and other individuals without an affiliation to a particular group. Some chanted "We shall overcome" and called for an end to racism.Efia Nwangaza, director of the Malcom X Center for Self Determination, said she has long hoped the statue would be taken down and destroyed."I'm very pleased that finally this issue is being addressed locally," she said.Nwangaza also called for the repeal of the Heritage Act, the state law that requires a two-thirds vote from the General Assembly to change or remove a monument or rename a school or street named after a historical figure. Members of the Sons of Confederate Veterans camp 36, which includes Greenville, came early and staked out a position around the statue with stacks of water bottles and sandwiches to cope with the hot day. Rollis Smith, commander of camp 36, and other members of his group chased away some people who also supported the statue if they became verbally argumentative with the monument opposition.He gave no ground, however, to the idea of moving the statue.Smith said he and the others came to support the monument, which has been in place guarding the cemetery since the 1920s when it was moved from a downtown traffic circle after being hit by too many cars.More: Moving the Confederate monument was controversial in 1922One of the tense moments in the rally happened when protesters and counter-protesters were made to switch sides about 3 p.m. None of the groups involved had a permit, so police said they had a limited amount of time to occupy the space around the monument.Fearing a confrontation between the two groups, the Greenville Police Department took measures to ensure a safe transition by allowing the groups to cross at opposite ends of the street.Once at the base of the monument, the rally organizers spoke for about an hour before disbanding with a prayer.In a video posted to Fighting Injustice Together's Facebook page on Aug. 23, founder Bruce Wilson said he wasn't aware such a monument existed in the city."With everything that has been going on with these confederate statues... I did not know we had one in downtown Greenville,” Wilson said.Greenville Police Chief Ken Miller said he was pleased that the rally was peaceful."All in all, no arrests, no one harmed, no property damage and people were able to express themselves," Miller said.Miller said his department also received assistance from the Greenville County Sheriff's Office and intelligence from the FBI and SLED Another group of about 30 members of the Light Foot Militia, dressed in combat fatigues, stood on Elford Street and Main Street across from the rally. They said they were neutral and were present to assist the police in maintaining peace if that became necessary.More: Gov.
