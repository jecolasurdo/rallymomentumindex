They gathered in the Perth Cultural Centre and then marched to Forrest Chase.AdvertisementProtesters taking part in Saturday's Black Lives Matter rally in Perth.Credit:Cam Atkinson"We need to continue to highlight Aboriginal issues, including incarceration rates, and we need to highlight attitudes towards African people living in Perth," said the rally organiser."When a person of colour walks into a shop a security guard will be following them in moments. They'll ask to search their bags and follow them the whole time they are in the store. That doesn't happen to white people."Ms Paige said she was inspired to organise the rally when she realised some friends had organised similar events in Brisbane and Melbourne.She's planning more protests in the future."One rally is never going to change anything but we are planning more events.The message we were putting across on Saturday was really well received by the people that we came across," she said.
