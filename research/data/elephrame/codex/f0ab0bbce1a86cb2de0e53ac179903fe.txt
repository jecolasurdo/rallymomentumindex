Jones, 34, of Worcester, said he and his peers joined together for four-and-a-half minutes to block the area near an Interstate 290 ramp.Massachusetts State Police tweeted about the event but said there were no delays. The number of minutes protesters stood in the road, clasping hands, was for the number of hours Michael Brown's body was in the street after a police-involved shooting in Ferguson in August.The grand jury's decision last fall not to indict Officer Darren Wilson in that case sparked national outrage. The "I Can't Breathe” movement grew a few weeks later as news circulated of Eric Garner's death in Staten Island after an officer pinned him down in a chokehold. Mr. Garner was recorded on video telling officers 11 times before he died that he couldn't breathe.Actor Samuel L. Jackson recently took to social media to share a chant-like song for protesters to sing titled "I Can't Breathe.” The lyrics include the line, "Calling out the violence of the racist police, we ain't gonna stop 'til people are free.'”In a video of the Kelley Square demonstration posted on YouTube by the Future Focus Media Coop, some motorists honked their horns and seemed agitated as protesters held hands to form a human chain that spanned Route 122A outside the Hotel Vernon. At one point, the protesters parted to allow an ambulance, with its emergency lights on, to pass through the intersection. Then they resumed their positions blocking traffic.Mr. Jones said he and other organizers of the local "Black Lives Matter” movement were prepared to move out of the way for emergency response vehicles coming through as they sang Mr. Jackson's song on Martin Luther King Jr. Day.Worcester Police Sgt. Kerry Hazelhurst said there were no arrests or warnings issued in the demonstration. He said a couple of police officers were there to provide safety to demonstrators crossing the intersection.Mr. Jones said he and other organizers of the local "Black Lives Matter" movement were prepared to move for emergency response vehicles coming through the intersection.About 30 minutes after the demonstration, Mr. Jones stood on Water Street with a megaphone and a hand-rolled cigarette in hand, with other demonstrators close by, and a police vehicle drove past. He called his group's efforts part of a "love revolution.”Asked about protests blocking traffic on Interstate 93 last week in Milton and Medford, Mr. Jones said he believed those protests were a necessary action."People were angered but ... maybe that (rather) had to do with a silent frustration,” he said.Mr. Jones said that as a black man living in Worcester for 20 years, he believes he has been the subject of targeting by police. He alleged he was stopped as a freshman at Clark University years ago for matching the description of a suspect and treated unfairly at that time."Before I knew it, my wallet was out and I was over the front of a car," he said. "The silence is deafening."The group issued a statement, which read in part:"We make a statement with our bodies and our voices to call for a massive, widespread change of hearts and attitudes towards black lives, insisting that they matter to us all. Moreover, we bring a 'love revolution' that changes our current system of power over one another to power in cooperation with each other, for the greater good."
