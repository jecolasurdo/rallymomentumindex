Mime Troupe's Schooled Arts Events Education Classes & Seminars Recommended Stand-Up Paddleboarding Lessons When the ancient Polynesians invented surfing, they often used a paddle to help them navigate. Fast-forward a few millennia, and Stand-Up Paddleboarding, or SUP, finds itself trendy again. Part of its increasing popularity is that standing upright allows surfers to spot waves more easily and thus catch more of them, multiplying the fun factor. Paddling back to the wave becomes less of a strain as well. The ability to cruise along on flat inland water, surveying the sights, is another advantage. Finally, it's a good core workout. If you're sold on the idea, schedule an intro SUP lesson, free with board and paddle rental, and you may find yourself riding the waves like a Polynesian king.

Saturday mornings at the Randall Museum can bring that memory back, or create a new one for the youngsters. Ceramics make great gifts — especially on Mothers' and Fathers' Day. Hop on board for the Randall's once-weekly class, and for $6 and two weeks to have your work fired and glazed, you'll have all the materials you need.

About 100 protesters associated with the #BlackLivesMatter movement have occupied the upscale supermarket near Lake Merritt. Entrances and checkout aisles are blocked, according to SF Weekly reporter Julia Carrie Wong, currently on scene. That Whole Foods was the scene of a violent confrontation last week, in which a security guard allegedly assaulted an unarmed black man, who was there attempting to buy food with an EBT card on Sept. 3. The shopper, who has yet to be identified, has secured legal counsel. The security guard has been fired and her firm, Admiral Security, removed from the location. But that has not satisfied protesters, who as of 6:22 p.m. had succeeded in shutting the store down. Protesters have linked arms to block the checkout aisles. Some determined shoppers have made away with single origin this and organic that, but largely commerce has ground to a halt. Because it's hard to judge the quality of a mango when a crowd of angry activists are shouting at you.

Customers are lining up to check out at the coffee bar pic.twitter.com/XLn5qk5szi— Julia Carrie Wong (@juliacarriew) September 11, 2015 Today has been a fraught day for the #BlackLivesMatter set. This morning, video footage was released in the case of Natasha McKenna, a mentally ill woman who died in police custody after being repeatedly Tasered (it is not a fun watch). Earlier today, well-known civil rights attorney John Burris — who has been retained by the unknown shopper as legal counsel — told reporters that the shopper suffered a concussion and broken facial bones after being slammed into the concrete outside of the store. Whole Foods claims to have no video footage of the incident, according to KQED, despite "at least six" cameras placed with a full view of the exit area.

The packed Brava Theater hosted an initially seated crowd that ended the night jumping and dancing against the front of the stage. The trio performed a set focused on their recently released Sci-Fi Horror concept album, 'Splendor & Misery', then delved into their dancier and more aggressive back catalogue, and recent single 'Wriggle'. Opening performances included local experimental electronic duo 'Tujurikkuja' and computer music artist 'Madalyn Merkey.'"
