A "Stand with Charlottesville" rally was also hosted Sunday night in Huntsville by the Huntsville chapter of the advocacy group Indivisible. Rallies with similar purposes were hosted in cities across the U.S. on Sunday."We all know we are here because of what took place over the past 48 hours: the hatred, killing, people injured, and these are people that looked just like this crowd," Cara McClure, founder of the Birmingham chapter of Black Lives Matter, told the crowd through a megaphone.No violence took place during the rally, which did not appear to be accompanied by a counter-protest. Several police officers watched the event without incident and police cars blocked traffic on two roads adjacent to the protest, which was centered on the Storyteller Fountain. The area around the fountain was known as a frequent meeting place for racist neo-Nazi factions of skinheads in the early 1990s.Protesters held signs with slogans like "Make Racists Afraid Again," "Love Trumps Hate," "You Protect Statues / I Protect People," and "DSA Solidarity With Cville Against Racism." They sang "This Land Is Your Land" and repeated chants including "No Trump / No KKK, /No fascist USA," "Black Lives Matter," and "Show me what democracy looks like / This is what democracy looks like."Multiple pastors also addressed the crowd, spreading messages of intolerance for hate and love for one's neighbor."White supremacy and both systematic and individual racism are the founding corners of this country. Let us not forget this is a historical phenomenon ... It is not only a historical relic, it is also the reality of here and now," Rev. Jennifer Sanders, pastor of Beloved Community Church in Birmingham, said."If we genuinely believe in our religious teachings, we must not walk away from this," Sanders added later in her remarks.Hoover residents Matt and Valerie Suggs brought their children, five-year-old Maggie and two-year-old Arlo, to the rally to help teach them "that activism is an important part of our country and to show them that it is OK to stand up for other people," as Matt Suggs said.Matt Suggs and his two-year-old son Arlo stand at the rally in solidarity with antifascists and others who protested neo-Nazis and white nationalists in Charlottesville, Va., over the weekend.

"I'm a little bit disappointed that the president didn't take a harder stance and we wanted to come down and show our support and take the hard stance ourselves."Robin Rains, chairwoman of Birmingham's DSA chapter, spoke out against neo-Nazis and white nationalists and urged everyone to participate in the effort to resist their ideology."What happened yesterday was absolutely shocking, but it was not surprising. Neo-Nazis are on the rise," she told the crowd."We have an obligation to put our bodies in harm's way. We have an obligation to stop the mobilization of white supremacy."Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).Â© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
