"It's easy to sit behind your computer screen and fall into this place of worry and fear of what's going on in the world. To see this many people come together around an idea that we all support, hopefully all with good reason, it's meaningful to everyone here."The issue at hand for hundreds of protesters marching the streets of Ann Arbor was to express frustrations with recent actions of police officers resulting in the death of black males, in addition to building consensus for more community oversight of law enforcement.Although a chant commonly heard throughout the evening was "black lives matter" - an opinion held by many of those protesting - event organizers were quick to separate themselves from any movement or affiliation to a group.Event co-organizer Diante Harris said he was grateful to see support from a diverse audience come together to address what he believes are of strained relationships between the black population and law enforcement."If the police officers are going to understand the community that they serve in, they need to hear us and be proactive in this, as well," he said. "It's not that black people need to change what they're doing to change the system; it's the systematically racist police departments that need to look at themselves and reflect on how they can better serve the people who pay their salaries."Detractors of the Black Lives Matter, including former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani Giuliani, have said the group is "inherently racist" and divides America. Others believe a slogan like "All Lives Matter" is a more fitting term, despite repeated explanations of why Black Lives Matter is a relevant platform for discussion about race throughout the country."No one who says 'black lives matter' is saying that other lives don't matter," Harris said. "We're all educated enough to know that we care about everyone, but right now, it's the black lives that are being taken disproportionately to their white counterparts. Right now it is the black lives that are being displayed on TV for everyone to see."Terminology and wording are irrelevant, Harris said, when considering the relationships that exist between law enforcement and predominantly black communities - which is what the group was addressing Wednesday."At this point I don't think there's equality anywhere - even in a place like Ann Arbor," he said. "We may not have the same high crime rates as some of these bigger cities and abuse at the hands of police, but there are still people who are growing up here in fear of police. I can't speak for the whole black community, but personally, growing up the only times we saw police was when someone was getting arrested. So there is a distrust with the recent things that have been happening."Those counter to the Black Lives Matter movement and protests point to the low number of officers convicted of murder or manslaughter in fatal on-duty shootings. Others have noted a recent study claiming blacks are not targeted in police shootings.A paper recently published on police force by Harvard University professor of economics Roland G. Fryer Jr. found no bias against black civilians in police shootings in 10 cities and counties, including Houston and New York. It did, however, find bias against blacks in every other type of force used, including the use of hands or batons.Fryer's study contradicts a previously published paper in PLOS ONE by Cody T. Ross. That paper, "A Multi-Level Bayesian Analysis of Racial Bias in Police Shootings at the County-Level in the United States, 2011-2014," found that the chance of being black, unarmed and shot by the police was about 3.5 times higher than the chance of being white, unarmed and shot by the police.While those who attended Wednesday's protest didn't cite studies or statistics to illustrate their frustration with perceived racial bias in law enforcement, people like Erica Hampton feel the use of force is used disproportionately on people of color.Hampton, 30, of Ypsilanti, spoke overwhelmingly in favor of working together among races and socioeconomic classes to hold law enforcement accountable for how it uses force in the line of duty. Event organizers have spoken about working with local law enforcement to develop a citizen review committee."We're the ones they're pulling their guns on before thinking first or using another form of force," she said."We need everybody to get this accomplished. It's not just a black people problem, it's a humanity problem," she added. "We need all races to stand up for what we're going through to get changes made. If new policies are going to be enforced, we're going to need the backing of all people."Despite taking part in a protest questioning the actions of police, many in attendance on Wednesday lauded the efforts of Ann Arbor Police Department members who led the way for protesters through downtown streets. Protesters also observed a moment of silence for the five police officers recently killed during a Black Lives Matter protest in Dallas, in addition to the black males who died as a result of deadly force in encounters with police.Tony Williams, 25, of Ann Arbor, said he attended the protest because he wants to see a more harmonious relationship between all races and law enforcement."I've never actually had a (negative) encounter with police - in my experiences, they've all been really nice," he said. "But I see people who don't look like me or talk like me and others - my cousins and family - I'm out here for them."The connection I want to see made between law enforcement and black people is that they can feel safe around a uniform," he added.Many attending Wednesday's march noted they were happy to see community-wide support for black lives, and hope any future events or discussions can advance a meaningful dialogue about the state of race relations - both locally and throughout the country.Antweana Wilson, 17, of Detroit, said she hopes both supporters and detractors of movements like Black Lives Matter can at least understand each other's point of view and the issues black people face on a daily basis."If they don't understand why we're out here doing what we're doing, you have to let them know that this doesn't happen with everybody," she said. "Right now, we as black people are suffering. There's a lot going on and we need people to know that we're trying to take care of things peacefully, but at the same time, all lives won't matter until black lives matter."We hope this proves a point that it doesn't matter what color you are - black, white, brown, pink, whatever - it doesn't matter," she added. "We can come together to make a change. It's wonderful to see all different people out here supporting black lives."Martin Slagter covers higher education for The Ann Arbor News.
