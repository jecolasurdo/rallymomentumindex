TAMPA — Hundreds of protesters marched in East Tampa and St. Petersburg on Sunday afternoon, joining in nationwide protests against the toll of police violence on African Americans.But in Tampa, officials geared up to prevent a repeat of Saturday night's chaos and destruction.Mayor Jane Castor instituted a curfew for her city, from 7:30 p.m. to 6 a.m.. Gov.

"They want to take over your voice and they want to take over your words and that is not going to be tolerated."We took a hard stance last night and I think we're going to take an even harder stance tonight. We'll be flexible. But we'll be out there and we have some plans.”Related: In Tampa, life carries on among the ashesDugan's warning came as an enormous group of protesters hundreds strong moved through downtown Tampa, attempting to access and block Interstate 275, before police stopped them with spray and non-lethal bullets.

Mahoney (@mahoneysthename) May 31, 2020 It all made for an intense Sunday in the bay area, as outrage continued across the nation in response to the death of George Floyd last week, after a Minneapolis police officer was recorded kneeling on his neck for nearly nine minutes.

Both said they condemn police brutality and share in the outrage over Floyd's death. But that evening, Castor said, something changed, as people started throwing "fireworks, glass bottles and rocks,” Castor said.Officers arrested 41 people. About 40 businesses were damaged and looted; five were set on fire and more damage may be reported. Twenty-seven police vehicles were damaged, mostly shattered windows and punctured tires. One Tampa officer suffered minor burns when a mortar was thrown at police."When the violence began and the arrests started to be made I was certain — I was certain — those individuals were from outside the city,” Castor said. "The story this morning was they were not."What I saw last night was not a call for voices to be heard, for ideas to effect change or ways to shine a light on inequality. What I saw was shameful. What I saw was also heartbreaking for our community. And what I saw did not reflect our community and the values we all share.”People now gathering around Curtis Hixon Park.

A recorded police announcement declared it an "unlawful assembly."Marchers scrambled into an adjacent cemetery, then returned to confront police, taunting them, with one saying: "Are the multiple deaths of black men funny to you?”Protester Marissa Holloman, 31, said she saw a man in civilian clothing, standing near some officers, unzip his jacket and display a badge. Later, she said she saw that man throw a water bottle into the crowd."When everybody rushed, that's when they started with the tear gas,” she said. "These are the same places my grandma had to do bus boycotts. Thirty-one years later, I'm here doing the same thing. It's got to stop.”Gas, smoke. ⁦@TB_Times⁩ pic.twitter.com/plkohdkjP8— Dan Sullivan (@TimesDan) May 31, 2020 One 30-year-old East Tampa resident's opinion. Emotions raw.
