Participants took part in the mile-long march from the First Universalist Unitarian Church to Grace United Church of Christ in Wausau.The march came on the same day Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake said she was lifting the six-day curfew imposed after riots ensued after Freddie Gray, 25, died April 19 of spinal injuries sustained while in police custody April 12. The riots resulted in the arrests of more than 200 people and injuries to at least 20 police officers. Charges have since been filed against the six officers involved in his arrest, ranging from manslaughter to second-degree murder.Similar recent deaths of black men at the hands of police in Ferguson, Missouri, Staten Island in New York City, and Madison, have inspired protests across the nation and drawn attention to racial profiling and violence in the justice system. Organizers of Sunday's event in Wausau, however, said the purpose of the March was geared toward building dialogue and understanding between people, and not on any issues with local police.FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInBlack Lives Matter march FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Tony Patterson, chairman of the Marathon County Diversity Affairs Commission, said that populations of African Americans, Southeast Asians and Hispanics continue to grow in the Wausau area, and there's a need to engage them. Patterson said representatives from the Southeast Asian and Hispanic communities have already reached out to him to hold future events. The Rev. Laurie Bushbaum, interim minister at the First Universalist Unitarian Church of Wausau, said in a sermon to parishioners prior to the march that there was much still to be done in terms of building understanding between races, and that it wouldn't always would be easy."Meeting at the fence of racism is hard work, but this is how we take down those fences and build a community," Bushbaum said.Myles, a student at Wausau East High School, is biracial and said she's heard jokes and stereotypes about being black. She added that she doesn't always see a lot of interest among her peers in terms of understanding issues faced by African Americans."There were kids I know who didn't know there was anything going on in Baltimore. It's disappointing that there are people who are ignorant about important events are happening," Myles said.Buy PhotoEllicia Myles, right, and her mother Lisa make signs for the Black Lives Matter march on Sunday in Wausau.

(Photo: Dan Young/Gannett Central Wisconsin Media)Myles added that she's one of only around 30 African American students at Wausau East and that often she's the only one in her classes, meaning she doesn't often have much opportunity to connect with African American peers and discuss issues or promote more understanding. Myles, however, said she was encouraged by the attendance of Sunday's event."There seems to be a lot of people who are interested in learning more," Myles said.Darrell Keaton, of Oshkosh, is the founder of Men & Women 4 Change Social Club, an organization founded in Wausau in 2011 to promote diversity and support awareness of minority-owned businesses and organizations in central and southern Wisconsin. On Sunday, Keaton and his wife Rose were selling T-shirts commemorating the event."We hadn't heard of another event like this in the state, and I think it's overdue," Keaton said. "I think this is a great community, and it's nice to see that people are showing leadership and working to communicate with each other."Nathan Vine can be reached at 715-345-2252.
