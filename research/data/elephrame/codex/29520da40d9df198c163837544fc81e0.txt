She was thinking about the pain Floyd endured, the pain endured by so many black Americans, she said later. She remembered being pregnant with her 11-month-old son and praying that it would be a girl."The fact that now I have a black son that's going to be raised in this nation, it just adds a whole other layer of sorrow and you don't want to feel hopeless, you don't want to be helpless," said Brown, who works at Nationwide Children's Hospital. "But it's hard to figure out what to do."At OhioHealth Riverside Methodist Hospital, many had their heads down. Some held up signs reading "Racism is a public health issue" and "White coats for black lives.""As we complain about not being able to breathe in our masks while at work, stores and restaurants, imagine during these 8½ minutes of silence that someone is willfully preventing you from breathing," Anita Somani, an OhioHealth obstetrician/gynecologist, said into the microphone before taking a knee.OhioHealth Grant Medical Center, OhioHealth Doctors Hospital and OhioHealth Dublin Methodist Hospital also participated in Friday's 'White Coats for Black Lives' event.White Coats for Black Lives moments of silence also were observed at other central Ohio hospitals.Sheila Okere, a medical student at Ohio State, brought her homemade sign that said, "Y'all better keep this same energy when the protest is over. My existence is not a trend."Realize systemic racism in America shouldn't have taken another lost life, she said. She hopes the conversation continues well past the end of the protests this time."This isn't a moment. I'm black all year," she said. "This may be a moment for you but this is something that I have cried about, I have been angry about my entire life and I don't have control over."Jessica Munoz, a fourth-year medical student, hopes to work in the emergency room. She has already thought about treating people who were shot by police."I just feel like we need to stand up and really try to change the system to save more lives."jmyers@dispatch.com@_jcmyersmhenry@dispatch.com@megankhenry Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you.
