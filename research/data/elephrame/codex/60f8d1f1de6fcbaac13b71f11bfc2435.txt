"Today in major cities across the country similar protests have been held.”On Sept. 20 multiple protests were spurred in Charlotte, North Carolina after a black man was shot and killed in an officer-involved shooting, according to a report by USA Today.USA TODAYProtests erupt in Charlotte after police kill man; 12 officers hurtMainguy said luckily the Port Huron community and it's police department have done well to avoid issues of unjust police shootings, but still, she said it is a national issue that needs to be addressed.She said the majority of those driving by have responded positively by honking their horns or holding up peace signs."If more people are aware of what is happening, then maybe we can reverse what is happening,” she said. "If we are quiet though, that means we let the system continue oppressing us.”Mond Jones, 20, of Port Huron, said because he is black he does not have the privilege to not worry about police brutality."Black and brown lives matter,” Jones said. "It's important that we show our support and let others know they are not alone.”Contact Nicole Hayden at (810) 989-6279 or nhayden@gannett.com.
