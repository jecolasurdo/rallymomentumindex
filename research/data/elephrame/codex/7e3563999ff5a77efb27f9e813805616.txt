This story and those entries have been updated with further reporting.Des Moines is bracing for another round of protests this weekend after a peaceful rally Friday night devolved into a violent melee that spread through the East Village.Police said at least 18 arrests were made for failing to disperse. Participants in the unrest broke windows at Hilltop Tire Service and Embassy Suites, among other nearby buildings. The initial gathering in Des Moines was a peaceful protest of Minneapolis police action that led to the death of black Minnesota resident George Floyd. But at 7:45 p.m., a crowd swarmed Des Moines police officers on the corner of Court Avenue and East Second Street, jumping on patrol cars and throwing water bottles. One officer released pepper spray out of his car, hitting nearby protesters.Tensions escalated from there. A riot crew arrived at the intersection at about 7:50 p.m., as protesters chanted, "I can't breathe," shouted expletives at police officers, and knelt in Floyd's honor. Five minutes later, officers in riot gear formed a line and pushed the crowd of about a hundred people. They continued to use pepper spray on the crowd, which included journalists.More:What one Des Moines Register reporter saw during George Floyd protests — until he was temporarily blinded by pepper sprayShortly after 8 p.m., protesters threw bricks and rocks at police cars, prompting officers in riot gear to throw tear gas canisters and continue to push their formation against protesters. Protesters assembled medical stations and doused milk on protesters who were injured by chemical irritants.Michael Turner, an organizer of the initial rally, distanced his event from protesters who turned violent after their event had ended. "While we sympathize with the feeling of anger amongst many Americans, we are deeply saddened and disappointed that a small group of protesters have stayed on site and begun to damage property and antagonize our police force who gracefully supported our cause without disturbance," he said in a statement released Friday night. "We in no way are affiliated with these events and strongly oppose them." Protesters chanted the names of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black woman who was shot eight times by police in Louisville, Kentucky, in March. The crowds lingered in the streets of East Village into the early hours of Saturday.Floyd, 46, died Monday after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pinned his knee on the man's neck for at least eight minutes. Police were responding to reports from a nearby grocery store claiming Floyd made a purchase using a fake $20 bill.Videos taken by witnesses show Floyd lying on his stomach, handcuffed and pleading with officers, "I can't breathe," before losing consciousness. Bystanders begged officers to release him. Protesters have demanded justice, calling for the arrest of four police officers involved with Floyd's detainment. The officers were fired earlier in the week and, on Friday, Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. Floyd's family says that's not enough. They've demanded that the charges be elevated to first-degree murder.Cities across the nation, including Denver, Los Angeles, New York City, Phoenix, Louisville — and now Des Moines — have followed with their own protests against racism and police brutality both locally and nationally.With Friday's clash still fresh, the nonprofit Mothers Against Violence gathered Saturday near East 14th Street and University Avenue in Des Moines. Another event is planned for Sunday, with Des Moines-area pastor Rob Johnson and other community activists and faith leaders leading a candlelight vigil.Des Moines-area civil rights advocates April Wells and Charmaine Bell are organizing a "Together we can make a change” memorial and call to action that begins at 6:30 p.m. Monday at the Iowa Capitol.
