Five activists who refused to eat for 17 days, along with their supporters, are holding a peaceful protest at City Hall. The five ended their hunger strike Saturday after they were taken to the hospital. A protest organizer announced at the protest that most of the five will start eating solid food again Monday.

Members of the so-called Frisco Five, the group that held a 17-day hunger strike, were still in the hospital and getting reaccustomed to food. Their supporters, many in the Justice for Alex Nieto group, held the demonstration in their absence. "This is excellent,” Ben Bac Sierra, 44, one of the protest organizers, said of the turnout. "Some will come and go, but the spirit and momentum out here is beautiful.” Monday's protest came after 33 demonstrators were arrested Friday night when they clashed with sheriff's deputies who forced them to clear out of the rotunda of City Hall when they refused to disperse. The late-night rally caused thousands of dollars in damage to the building, officials said. Related Stories On 16th day of hunger strike, "Frisco 5” taken to hospital Hunger strikers make it to mayor's office, but he's not there Bac Sierra — whose friend Nieto was fatally shot by four San Francisco police officers in Bernal Heights Park in 2014 — said Monday's strike proves "his spirit is living on.” Many came clad in red and black clothing, which Nieto wore the day he died. Nieto's parents, Refugio and Elvira, helped lead the protest, saying they were hopeful that continuing demonstrations would advance justice for their son and others who have been shot and killed by San Francisco police. In March, a federal jury rejected the Nieto family's civil rights lawsuit, finding the officers who shot Nieto did not use excessive force after he allegedly pointed a stun gun at them. "We're not tired at all,” said Elvira Nieto. "You have to have energy to support the struggle.” The Police Department released a statement reiterating that Suhr will not resign because he wants to see the implementation of department reforms being worked on by him, the mayor's office and the Department of Justice. Mayor Ed Lee has said he has no plans to fire Suhr. Monday's protest was the latest in a series of demonstrations calling for Suhr's job since the fatal shooting of Mario Woods on Dec. 2. Tensions between the police and the community flared again last month when Luis Gongora was killed at a homeless encampment after he, like Woods, allegedly refused to drop a knife. A group of UCSF medical students, calling deaths of black and Latino people by police a public health crisis, opted to skip their morning lecture to participate in the protest. "Policing is a very complex profession,” said first-year medical student Johanna Glaser. "But a disproportionate amount of violence falls on black and brown lives.” Protesters picketed on the sidewalk outside the front and back entrances to City Hall, marching in a circle and shouting chants and songs demanding the police chief be fired. About noon, they marched around City Hall's perimeter 17 times to symbolize the number of days hunger strikers refused to eat. Inside the building, voters had their first opportunity Monday to cast a ballot in the state primary. Some poll workers were concerned the demonstration would discourage voters from going to City Hall to vote, but they weren't sure by how much and said they hadn't gotten any complaints. Some parents, like San Francisco resident Annie Bacon, brought their young children to the protest, giving them permission to skip school. Bacon said that she was trying to explain police brutality to her 4-year-old son, Dash, and that coming to City Hall was part of his education. "My little white kid is protected in a way these kids aren't,” she said. "And so it's our privilege to be out here and say our lives don't matter more than black and brown lives.” The front steps of City Hall were barricaded by sheriff's deputies, but city officials said it was because they needed to repair damage from Friday night's protest.
