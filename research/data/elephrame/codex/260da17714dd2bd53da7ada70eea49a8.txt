"I don't think that most of us are willing to talk about it. I grew up with a lot of racism in the white suburbs of Detroit, and yet it almost never gets named.""I want to see more of this," she continued, referencing the crowd around her. "I'd love to see white people, black people, Latino people, get more radicalized in this area and really just start to fight hard."Rev. Desirae Kelly-Kato speaking. "We... need to be responsible for educating individuals that hide behind the cloak of bigotry" pic.twitter.com/wFi3XdDTOE— Chris Haxel (@ChrisHaxel) August 19, 2017Contact Christopher Haxel at 517-377-1261 or chaxel@lsj.com.
