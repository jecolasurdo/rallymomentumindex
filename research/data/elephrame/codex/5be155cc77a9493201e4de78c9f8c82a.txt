(WTVY) - A peaceful rally was held Saturday in protest of police brutality and the mishandling of a recent incident with a 17 year old boy. Pictures are circulating showing Ulysses Wilkerson with a severely beaten face after allegedly resisting arrest around 11:00 p.m. December 23rd. Wilkerson is in need of multiple eye surgeries and the family says officers of the Troy Police Department are responsible -- and they want answers. Community leaders invited concerned residents together for a peaceful protest for the way the officers handled the incident. "The message of today's rally is to get facts. What the family is wanting more than anything is answers. Where is the body cam? Where are the videos? they have? What evidence do they have? Why did they stop Ulysses Wilkerson at 11:00 at night? What was their reason? What was he suspicious of, being a black person walking?" I mean the family wants answers.. and they wanted to do it peacefully."- Pastor Kenneth Sharpton Glasgow, family advocate The rally was held across the street from the Troy Police Department protesting the department's handling of the matter.
