[ Woodland Hills head coach Marcus Burkley Sr. took to Facebook ] over the weekend after the game, telling Channel 11 that tensions seemed to begin to rise after some of his players kneeled during the playing of the national anthem. Content Continues Below "It seemed like everything started once the national anthem started. Two or three of my players took a knee,” he said. "Once they took a knee, you see cameras and people taking pictures. And out of nowhere you hear, 'If the little N-word want to take a knee, they shouldn't be able to play." RELATED: Cornell HS cheerleaders' decision to kneel during national anthem upsets vets Burkley said the comment came from the stands. He said his 12- and 13-year-old players then heard it on the field. "Players told me, they say, 'Coach, they're calling us the N-word,'” Burkley said. The coach said tensions escalated from there. He said his players' parents at one point tried to get food at the concession stand and were turned away. "They just said, 'We're not serving you Woodland Hills people. This is for Bethel fans, it's our senior day.' But with all that going on, it seemed like another attack,” Burkley said. Woodland Hills won the game but not before police were called to stand guard on the field and keep the peace, Burkley said. "It was a sad night, and we were glad to get out of there,” he said. Burkley's team has played in the Parkway Youth Football League for two years. He said never in that time, or during his years as a player, did he see such hatred. "Those three or four bad apples, however many people were saying that stuff, doesn't represent the town of Bethel Park,” Burkley said. "But it was bad." Channel 11 News also spoke with Paul Currie, the president of the Bethel Park Junior Football League Monday night. He said that he was not aware of the comments being made and did not hear them. Currie said, however, if they were said, he does not condone that behavior. Currie said he was working to get to the bottom of the situation. © 2020 Cox Media Group Trending Now Army veteran empties gun at woman's vehicle in road rage incident, police say By Bob D'Angelo, Cox Media Group National Content Desk Statue of black man placed near dangling flagpole rope at Washington metro facility By Michael Spears, KIRO7.com Great-grandson of Aunt Jemima actress angered by removal of character from products By Bob D'Angelo, Cox Media Group National Content Desk Disney announces new reservation system ahead of reopening, suspends park-hopping By Adam Poulisse, WFTV.com Woman reunites with 100-year-old father at nursing home after he survives coronavirus By John Monahan, Boston25News.com News National Video Traffic Weather Radar About Us What's on WPXI-TV WPXI Public File EEOC Statement © 2020 Cox Media Group.
