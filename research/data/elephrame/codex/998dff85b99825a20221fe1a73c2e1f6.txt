The other three officers have not been arrested.Green Bay resident Tevin Taylor went to the protest with his family to demand change."We don't need any promises because we've always had promises without action. What we want is a plan of action to stop police officers from committing black genocide on black boys and girls," he said.The protesters continued and stopped in the front of the Green Bay Police Department where Green Bay Police Chief Andrew Smith applauded their peaceful protest that was "as American as apple pie." He said Chauvin was responsible for Floyd's murder and "if you're not disgusted as a police officer by what you saw in Minneapolis, you're in the wrong business." Smith was invited to the march and walked with the protesters.UWGB student Hannah Beauchamp-Pope, 18, has helped organize other protests and said she was surprised and glad to see so many people of different races and ages at the protest.During the protest, people laid on the Main Street Bridge to honor people who died as a result of police brutality and have a moment of silence for them."Black Lives Matter is about rehumanizing a criminalized race in this country," Beauchamp-Pope said.The protesters also stopped at the county courthouse to remember Jonathon Tubby and demanded justice for his shooting. Tubby was shot by Green Bay police officer Erik O'Brien in the sally port while being taken to the Brown County Jail in October 2018.Prosecutors did not charge O'Brien because they said the officer believed Tubby was armed and justified in shooting him.The protesters went back a second time before ending the three-hour protest at the police department.Dionte Tillman came from Appleton for the protest and hopes people will continue to remember why they are protesting and the energy won't wear down."We will only lose momentum if people forget about us and it has to come another killing for everybody to come all together for something that has happened for thousands of years," he said.A candelight vigil was planned tonight and another protest will kickoff on June 7 at Leicht Memorial Park at 11 a.m.Nusaiba Mizan and Sammy Gibbons contributed to this article.Contact Benita Mathew at (920) 309-3428 or bmathew@gannett.com.
