They chanted things like, "Love, not hate, makes America great."The group gathered for peace vigils in Grand Rapids' Ah-Nab-Awen Park and Rosa Parks Circle, mourning the victims of the incident in Charlottesville.Organizers passed a hat at both locations, and reported raising more than $1,200 for the Black Lives Matter chapter located in Charlottesville.Demonstrations in response to the events in Virginia were also held in Kalamazoo Saturday and Sunday, and in other cities across the country.Since white nationalists began protesting the removal of a statue commemorating Confederate General Robert E. Lee, the quiet Virginia college town was beset by violence that left one person dead and dozens injured.The long-planned "Unite the Right" demonstration was anticipated to be one of the largest gatherings of white nationalists in recent history. The protests were peaceful Friday, but the situation escalated Saturday morning when the groups clashed with counterprotesters near the statue.Skirmishes between white nationalists, some carrying make-shift shields and helmets, and groups like Black Lives Matter and anti-fascist groups known as "antifa," caused Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe to declare a state of emergency Saturday.After the rally at a city park was dispersed, a car bearing Ohio license plates plowed into a crowd near the city's downtown mall, killing a 32-year-old woman and injuring 19. The alleged driver, 20-year-old James Alex Fields Jr., was charged with second-degree murder and other counts.Later in the day, a Virginia State Police helicopter assisting with the situation in Charlottesville crashed near a golf course and burst into flames. The pilot and a passenger died at the scene.Saturday afternoon, President Donald Trump, addressed the situation at the start of a veterans' event at his golf club in Bedminster, N.J. Trump condemned the "hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides," but did not specifically reference the white nationalist nature of the demonstration.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).Â© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
