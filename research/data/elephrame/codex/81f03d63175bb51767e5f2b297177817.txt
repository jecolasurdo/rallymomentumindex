This was a clip from the original video please contact Tamia Taylor for full video and concerns. I repeat this is just a clip #fox2news FOX 2 Detroit WXYZ-TV Channel 7 Shaun King CNN International CNN News (World News)Posted by Alisha Nicole on Monday, May 25, 2020Video courtesy of Tovah Taylor.Multiple deputies had responded to the shots fired report at the 2000 block of Peachcrest Street, and officers arriving on scene found a 34-year-old female gunshot victim that required medical attention, police said. She was in stable condition as of Tuesday afternoon, police said.While investigating the scene for a shooter, deputies formed a perimeter to keep community members away from a potential shooter, police said. All residents but the Grady El's complied with the order, police said. Resident Tovah Taylor said the couple were asking officers why they were in the neighborhood.The situation escalated after the couple started "obstructing” the deputies from establishing the perimeter, Washtenaw County Sheriff Jerry Clayton said. One deputy started punching Grady El in the head, while another deputy deployed a taser on her husband, the video shows.Clayton called the incident "disturbing.""There is absolutely no doubt, and no argument from me, that the images in the video are disturbing,” he said. "It warrants a complete investigation.”The deputy shown punching Grady El has been placed on administrative leave, Clayton said, which is paid due to sheriff's office union requirements. The name of the deputy is not being released at this time to facilitate a fair internal investigation, Clayton said."We are finders of facts,” Clayton said. "We want to seek the truth, find the facts and provide all the context. What was going on, what was the specific resistant behavior, what was the officers attempts at use of force. We're going to respond to that.”Other staff involved with the incident were also placed on administrative leave pending investigation, police said. An external agency will review the internal investigation's findings, police said, and "use of force” training will be conducted.The sheriff's office will try to be as forthcoming as possible about the investigation, Clayton said, as long as it is respectful to the Grady El's and the deputy on leave.The video circulated on social media Tuesday, leading to a protest organized by Trische' Duckworth, founder and executive director of the nonprofit Survivors Speak. About three dozen residents marched outside the Washtenaw County Sheriff's Office headquarters, 2201 Hogback Road, protesting the altercation and the fact that the Grady El's are still incarcerated."We cannot continue to allow this,” Duckworth said. "What happens next? Is someone going to die next? Are they going to do this to child? There's just so much that can happen, so we have to take a stand.”She and the protesters moved inside the sheriff's office building after about a half hour of chanting "No Justice, No Peace" and more. Clayton addressed them inside to inform them that the officer was placed on leave and that Grady El is under medical supervision for any injuries suffered in the incident.Clayton also spoke with Nate Frazier, a community leader and founder of the nonprofit Heart to Heart, about the incident and answered some preliminary questions about the investigation.Video courtesy of Nate Frazier.A second protest is scheduled for 1 p.m. Wednesday, May 27.Grady El has accused police of unfair treatment twice in the past. She filed two lawsuits in Detroit federal court in the last year against officers in the Taylor Police Department for alleged harassment. Both lawsuits were dismissed.Read more from The Ann Arbor News:Judge to decide whether Ypsilanti Township primary races need intervention2 in 3 rural Washtenaw County communities don't have broadband internet, survey saysPark-goers flock to Ann Arbor's Bandemer Park docks on Memorial Day weekendNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
