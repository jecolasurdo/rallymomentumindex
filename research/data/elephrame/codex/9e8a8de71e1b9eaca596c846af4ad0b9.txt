Members of Dontre Hamilton's family joined local protesters and the NAACP to march around the city, in hopes of telling Milwaukee's leaders that enough is enough. Peaceful protests and chants for justice mask the agony and frustration felt by the family of Dontre Hamilton. "Do something Mayor Barrett, do something. I shouldn't have to wait 7 1/2 months to find out if the man that put 14 bullets in my son is going to jail," said Maria Hamilton, Dontre's mother. Dontre Hamilton was shot by Milwaukee Police Officer Christopher Manney in Red Arrow Park last April. He died from the incident. Officer Manney has since been fired from the police force for how he handled the situation that day. Hamilton's family wants Manney criminally charged in the death. "We really want people to understand holding the officer accountable is going to change the police structure, is going to change the attitudes of officers when breaking constitutional rights of individuals within our community," said Nate Hamilton, Dontre's brother. On Saturday, a crowd of 50 or so people rallied in Red Arrow Park and marched around the city hoping to draw attention to Dontre's story and others. This time, the Hamilton family was joined by members of the NAACP and other well-known rights groups. "We feel like if we can get with these groups and we can come together and focus on things and put real collective energy towards what we see our city to look like and view it as, then I think it's possible especially if these leaders say hey we're tired, enough is enough," said Nate Hamilton. Dontre's mother says even people who didn't know him are passionate about this cause. They all want to see more accountability when a life is lost. "The justice department, our government, all of them need to start holding these people accountable for the lives that they're taking and maybe we can have peace in the cities that we live in," said Maria Hamilton. Another protest is scheduled for tomorrow at 2 p.m. The group plans to join forces with Micah, some of Milwaukee's leaders in the religious community.

The police officer is not being charged, indicted, etc. I think the answer is clear and has already been given. Theres literally nothing to wait for anymore. Are you waiting for him to change his mind? Hes not gping to, and ill tell you why...because the protests have turned the hearts of Barrett abd Flynn away from, not towards you. They have become angry and they are closing their ears to your cries. Honestly, even those who agree that Dontre was murdered are growing weary of seeing the extreme political liberalism associating itself with your cause. Some of us want to stand with you, but it means standing alongside people for whom there is no line between acceptable and not acceptable behavior. We would be standing next to people that want to lecture us when we arent as "dedicated” to the cause as they are. I mean, for petes sake, youve got protestors on your team who wont buy a lego set for a kid because it has a police officer included. I am not exaggerating. Its hard for some of us to align ourselves with such extremism because it will appear as if we also support or endorse ideas that are completely separate from the cause of your son's justice.

Which pretty much proves my point about the extremists of this group chastising those who think differently. So much for freedom of speech when it comes to other, I guess. Heres what I daid that they didn't like:What exactly is she waiting for? The police officer is not being charged, indicted, etc. I think the answer is clear and has already been given.

My apologies for making the cause sound hopeless. I do believe that this group can make geadway, but through legal routes, not through protests. Start filing civil suits. December 14, 2014 at 4:49 am James If Ms Hamilton truly wantspeace, she should discourage some of her supporters from expanding the no snitching concept. Some of her supporters, including educators and directors at local nonprofit agencies, are suggesting that people should call the police less frequently. They are specifically encouraging this behavior in neighborhoods where crime rates are already high. It's a simple expansion of the no snitching policy that gang leaders encouraged. The result would be simple. Criminals would be able to commit crimes including shooting and killing without fear of being caught, because people would no longer report suspicious activity. That hardly sounds like peace. December 14, 2014 at 8:14 am taxpayer Go to the hood and do your protest no one cares about a black man that attacks a police man and gets shot!! We only care about innocent people period!!! December 14, 2014 at 5:09 pm ron Soulobiggetdaddy NEWS FLASH, GHETTO THUGS LIE, KILL, ROB, SHOT, AND MURDER EACH OTHER EVERY DAY. NO PROTESTS FOR THOSE BLACK LIVES.... December 14, 2014 at 7:09 pm ron Protest in the hood for black on black violence, zero. Protest for a dead thug who fought with a cop, every day. It's clear as day which black lives matter coming from the black community. You people make me sick. December 15, 2014 at 10:05 am Z Want peace? Then how about protesting all the well documented black on black violent crime. Where has all the outrage been the last few years as the black community has been blowing each other away on a daily basis? It's been nonexistent because they refuse to take accountability. They want to continue to play the victim culture and blame everyone else for their own problems.
