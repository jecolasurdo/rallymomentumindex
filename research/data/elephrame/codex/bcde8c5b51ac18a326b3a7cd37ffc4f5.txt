De Atley | rdeatley@scng.com and Emily Rasmussen | erasmussen@scng.com | The Press-EnterprisePUBLISHED: June 4, 2020 at 2:22 p.m. | UPDATED: June 4, 2020 at 4:05 p.m.About 400 demonstrators protesting the death of George Floyd stood along the edge of Mile Square Regional Park in Fountain Valley on Thursday, June 4, holding signs up to traffic. The protesters chanted, "No justice, no peace,” "Black Lives Matter,” "Say his name, George Floyd,” and "Say her name, Breonna Taylor,” as cars passed by shortly after 1 p.m., some honking in support. The demonstrators were at the corner of Edinger Avenue and Euclid Street. Marchers showed up with children and dogs. About five motorcycle officers were nearby, observing. A few waved at the protesters. Fountain Valley protesters take a knee and an 8 min 46 sec moment of silence — the time a Minneapolis policeman kneeled on his George Floyd's neck before he died — to honor Floyd. Organizer says it's "not just for Floyd,” also to honor others who have died from police violence pic.twitter.com/gnyN9QEdWy — Emily Rasmussen (@rasmussenreport) June 4, 2020 The demonstrators took a knee for an 8 minute, 46 second moment of silence — the time a Minneapolis policeman, Derek Chauvin, kneeled on his George Floyd's neck before he died. An organizer said the protest also was meant to honor others who have died from police violence. The group then began marching south on Euclid Street, with a route that circled the park Thursday's march was the third protest for George Floyd that Tiffany Minton, 20, of Anaheim Hills, has been a part of. Earlier this week the Fullerton College criminal justice student took part in demonstrations in Brea and Garden Grove. Minton said a Fountain Valley police officer came up to her at the very beginning of the protest, asked demonstrators to just stay on the sidewalk, and told them they were there if they needed anything It feels, she said, as though people are starting to listen. "It sparked an outrage and the outrage of that flame has not been exhausted,” Minton said of Floyd's death. "They kind of have to listen, they kind of have to take us a little bit more seriously.” While they marched south on Euclid, Minton pointed out the motorcycle officers who gave a friendly wave to protesters. "See, this is cool,” Minton said of the officers. Among the signs carried by the protesters: "Silence is in fact violence,” "Silence = betrayal. Unlearn hate,” and "'Momma' — George Floyd,” recalling one of Floyd's final utterances, "Momma, I'm through.” Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died on Memorial Day in Minneapolis in an act caught on video. He had been accused of passing a counterfeit $20 bill. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's May 25 death. On Thursday, a judge set bail at $750,000 apiece for three fired Minneapolis police officers charged with aiding and abetting in the killing of Floyd. Taylor, a 26-year-old black emergency medical technician, was shot eight times on March 13 after narcotics detectives knocked down the front door in Louisville. No drugs were found in the home.
