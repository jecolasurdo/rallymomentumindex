Murphy emurphy@wickedlocal.com @MurphReports Thursday Nov 30, 2017 at 10:53 AM Nov 30, 2017 at 5:23 PM Twice on Thursday students stood outside of Brookline High School to protest in response to two racist Snapchat videos that recently circulated online. The two videos featured former and current Brookline High students repeatedly using the "N" word. In one of the videos, one of the students mentions the Brookline High program African American and Latino Scholars, which supports high achievement among students of color. The remark in the video specifically targets a student in the program.Around 9 a.m. and later at 2 p.m. hundreds of students gathered in front of the school building holding signs and chanting "BHS,” "Love not hate” and "Black lives matter.” The aim was to bring more attention to the videos and what several students say has been a longtime problem with racism at the school. "This is just the nastiest it's gotten because there was evidence,” said Brookline High senior Baylee Mendezrainey. "It's really disturbing the fact that all this unfolded.”Mendezrainey referenced past incidents at the school where racist and anti-Semitic messages have been written on walls. The responses to those incidents, she said, were not enough to resolve the problem. "Many times it feels like it's us against them because many of us have to have each other's backs because the administration doesn't have our backs,” Mendezrainey said. The idea for this morning's protest came about after students, many in the African American and Latino Scholars program, came together to discuss how to respond to the videos, as well as the administration's response. The idea for the walkout was not any one student's idea, Mendezrainey said, but was born out of the collective conversation. "I feel like this was a call to action,” Mendezrainey said.The second protestFor freshman Ramon Perez and Sophomore Janelyn Rodriguez, the afternoon protest offered a mixed feeling of community and frustration.When he stepped out of the school to protest, Perez thought he might be the only one. "I felt like people wouldn't understand what people were going through,” said Perez.Seeing the hundreds of students gathering on Greenough Street and the diversity represented in the crowd reassured him, though responses from some white students have left him as frustrated and hurt as before. Perez and Rodriguez said that some white students have accused the protestors of using the videos as an excuse to skip class. Others, Perez and Rodriguez said, have accused them of bullying a student responsible for one of the videos. "We're not bullying him, we're just telling him how we feel,” said Perez. "We're telling everyone.”As he stood with Rodriguez listening to the students speaking to the crowd and leading cheers, Perez's expression changed to shock as he watched a nearby group of white students standing to the side and laughing. He said one of those students pretended to call former President Barack Obama and tell him that everything "was all under control now”. "They're laughing at our protest,” Perez said of the behavior. "There's a lot of racism in this town. They don't really want us here.”The administration's responseOn Nov. 29 both Superintendent Andrew Bott and Brookline High Headmaster Anthony Meyer emailed families to alert them to the videos.According to the email, BHS faculty and administration became aware of the first video when it was brought to their attention about a week ago. Yesterday, the email said, the school administration learned of the second video, which used the same language but was created by a different student. "We are disgusted and deeply disturbed that any member of the BHS community would make such vile, hate-filled videos,” the email said. "While it is hard to fathom the intent of such videos, their impact is clear and concerning. They degrade, dehumanize, and diminish our community.”According to the email, the administration identified the students involved in the first video and has taken "appropriate disciplinary consequences” and is now investigating the second video to "follow through with appropriate consequences”.The email did not specify what those consequences were. Both parents and students have called for more action, saying the school's response so far is not enough.For Mendezrainey, senior Penelope Cruz, senior Katherine Aguilar and others, the school's email rang hollow. They felt that school and district leadership did not do enough to specifically address the racist tone of the videos. "There's no heart behind it,” Mendezrainey said of the administration's response. Several, including Perez questioned why the administration waited a week to notify the community. He said he felt like the administration would have swept the videos "under the rug” if the videos had not gone viral. Students and parents alike have also questioned what disciplinary action has been taken against the student identified. "He should be here with an in-school suspension, and he should be required to take tolerance lessons,” said Cruz. Other students have called for more school-wide education and dialogue. After the morning protest ended, some students remained outside on the school steps to do their work, saying they didn't feel safe going inside. "We're taking control of our own learning,” Mendezrainey said. According to Aguilar who is in the African American and Latino Scholars program, the videos have worsened feelings among other students in the program of being targeted."We're already uncomfortable because we're in this program,” said Aguilar. "People point fingers.”Check back for updates.Read the full email to families here:November 29, 2017,Dear Families, We write to make you aware of two deeply disturbing videos recently made by former and current Brookline High School students. On Wednesday of last week, the first racist video was brought to the attention of members of the BHS faculty and administration. Today, BHS learned of a second video created by a different student that uses the same racist language. We want to make clear that on both a personal and professional level, we are disgusted and deeply disturbed that any member of the BHS community would make such vile, hate-filled videos. While it is hard to fathom the intent of such videos; their impact is clear and concerning. They degrade, dehumanize, and diminish our community. More importantly, they make many students feel unsafe and unsure of their standing in the BHS community. We want to be clear - these types of videos and behavior are unacceptable and have no place in our community. As soon as the high school became aware of the first video, the BHS administration immediately launched an investigation and provided support for the student targeted in the video. This initial investigation has been completed, the individuals involved identified, and BHS is following through with appropriate disciplinary consequences. The team at BHS has now begun an investigation into the second video and will follow through with appropriate consequences upon completion of this investigation. We are engaged in the work required to support the students who were personally targeted. Our team at BHS is currently planning community supports to put in place for students tomorrow. Through these steps, we will ensure opportunities for students to share their perspectives on the incidents, our response to the videos, and our ongoing work to strengthen the BHS school culture. We believe that our students as learners and leaders will help us become the school community everyone deserves.
