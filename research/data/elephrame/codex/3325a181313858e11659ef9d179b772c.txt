Chastity play is a brain game that can help you redefine your relationship. The person wearing the cage tries to give up all control over his sex life and to be denied the right to enjoy as he pleases. The bearer of the key seeks the opposite or to ensure the fidelity of his partner. In this guide we will look at how to choose a good model, how to properly put it on, and what it is like to wear it daily. How to choose your model?

Ideally, the length and width of the tube equals that of the resting penis. To choose, it's simple, you have to measure the penis after a cold bath. Use a non-elastic rope or string, then pass the rope around your penis then make a tight know. Your finger should not be able to pass through it. Try wearing it for a few minutes just to gauge if the measurement would be comfortable enough for you. If you do not feel any discomfort and the rope does not slip, then you got the perfect size. Gently cut the rope with a chisel before measuring it with a ruler or a meter. If the length of the string is between 11.9 and 13.2 cm then the inside diameter of the cock ring must be 4 centimeters Between 13.3 and 14.8 cm, the inside diameter of the cock ring must be 4.5 centimeters Between 14.9 and 16.3 cm, the inside diameter of the cock ring must be 5 cm Beyond, the inside diameter of the cock ring must be 5.5 cm and more.

After all, it must ba efficient enough to control your erection and prevent orgasm. Weight also plays a good role when it comes to having a good cock cage. The heavier the cage is, the harder it is to wear, at least in the beginning. I advise you to start with a light chastity cage like the bear trap or the CB-6000 before moving towards the Brig, a heavier man chastity cage. There are models that would definitely satisfy your fantasies, including custom cock cages. How to put on your chastity cage? It is very easy to put on a chastity cage, 6 quick steps are enough Lightly oil the inside of the cage and its ring: this facilitates the passage Wash your penis and purses well with hot water and with soap and end up with cold water to unburden Stand up if you already have some experience or sleep if you start, pass your sex and your scholarship in the ring.

Do the same with your cock in the cage. Use cold water or ice cubes in case of erection. Pass the lock in the holes dedicated to it at the top of the cage and the ring and close it all. Or close the handcuff if your cage is equipped. Give the key to your partner; always keep a double sealed envelope in case of emergency. How long to wear the cage? Start wearing the cage gradually: first for a few minutes, then an hour, then several hours during a play before moving to one or more days and nights. It's all about getting used to it and deciding whether it's something that you want to do long term. Wearing cock cages can be thrilling, exciting, and fun. It can also add that special something to your relationship. These chastity devices are especially popular in the BDSM community and dom/sub relationships. Why Being in a Chastity Is a Form of Being Submissive to Your Partner The primary idea of cock cages is surrendering all control to your partner. But why is this the case? A person wearing a chastity device won't be able to pleasure themselves or even get an erection. Their genitals will be locked in a cage, and the key will be safe with their dominant. The dom or a key holder will decide when to remove the cage and when can their sub have an erection or orgasm. That means the person wearing the cage will entirely surrender their sexuality to their partner. Quality BDSM chastity devices are made of stainless steel, so you won't be able to disregard your dominant's wishes. The very act of surrendering control can be liberating, and a submissive with a cock cage can only remember how it was before they got locked up. Longing for freedom and release can significantly increase pleasure once the dominant decides to give them. Also, chastity stories sing praises about submissive cock cages, and many describe them as good as it gets. Do Men in Cock Cages Develop Better Libido? One of the primary benefits of cock cages is satisfaction. While that satisfaction is definitely not sexual, the wearer will feel good for handing full control of their genitals. Moreover, the very fact that the key holder controls their sexuality can be quite arousing for some. That can create a rather strong bond between two people because this type of sex play requires an enormous amount of trust. There are also no impacts on the testosterone level, but the person wearing a cage will undoubtedly have more energy during sex after they remove it. Not to mention that the cage will prevent any type of stimulation and masturbation, which can lead to better self-control and self-esteem. Needless to say, once the person removes the cage, orgasms will be unforgettable. Is It Possible to Have Sex While in a Chastity Belt? Now, some might wonder if it were possible to have sex while wearing a chastity belt. If we talk about cock cages, it is still possible to have sex. However, we should mention that cages will prevent the wearer from getting an erection, and their penis will miss out on all the fun. But that doesn't mean that sex is impossible. There are other types of sex the couple could try out. The most obvious one is oral. The fact that they are locked up doesn't mean that they can't satisfy their mistress! And, of course, for more daring couples, a strap-on is always an option too. After all, the submissive can still be fucked in chastity, but they won't be able to have an erection. 10001000001 PreviousWhat The Experts Are Saying About Male Chastity and It's Effect on Your Life NextUnbiased Review of Male Chastity for Couples – How It Makes The Relationship Fun?
