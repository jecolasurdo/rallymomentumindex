Hamden police identified their officer Wednesday as former New Haven Officer Devin Eaton. He's served as an officer almost five years, starting in New Haven before being hired by Hamden a little less than three years ago. The Yale officer has not yet been identified, but New Haven Mayor Toni N. Harp said Wednesday that officer has been placed on administrative duty. Stephanie Washington was shot by police after Hamden and Yale police officers opened fire on a vehicle early Tuesday morning, according to Connecticut State Police. Community residents expressed concern and outrage in the hours after the shooting. During a press briefing Wednesday in New Haven City Hall, Harp said she is "troubled, concerned and frankly outraged” over the shooting. Harp said she called the family, who want privacy and time to heal. Harp, Hamden Mayor Curt B. Leng, New Haven Interim Chief Otoniel Reyes and Hamden Acting Chief John Cappiello addressed the public Wednesday afternoon after meeting with the state's attorney's office. According to state police, a car was stopped as Hamden police continued an investigation into the report of an armed robbery of a newspaper delivery driver at the Gas and Go Gas Station on Arch Street in Hamden. Related Stories Hamden officer-involved shooting sparks community fury Both Hamden and Yale officers discharged their weapons, Reyes said. The woman, seemingly unarmed at the time of the shooting, was in stable condition as of Tuesday afternoon, according to state police. "This incident betrays police actions gone horribly wrong along the Hamden/New Haven line and now Stephanie, as well as many residents, her family and friends must live with the consequences and resulting uncertainty of what was by every definition an unacceptable response,” Harp said. Police activity that spills into New Haven must be consistent with the city's standards, Harp said, so the department will be working on guidelines with neighboring jurisdictions on policy framework regarding cross-jurisdictional policies. "It will help address the anger and distrust many now have toward the police,” Harp said. Further, Leng said Hamden and New Haven will work together more closely on issues and Hamden police will start attending New Haven police district meetings to work on border issues, which he said likely would make an immediate impact. "It's all one community and that's how officers will look at it,” Cappiello said during the news conference. Leng also reiterated that anyone who may have information about Tuesday's shooting should contact state police as the shooting remains under investigation. In a teleconference Wednesday with state's attorney's office, they indicated the investigation is a top priority for their office, Leng said, and it would be done with the "highest level of transparency possible.” "Hamden and New Haven are committed to working more closely together,” Leng said. "The issues that are faced are not Hamden issues, they are not New Haven issues. They are community issues and the more we can work together on them the better we all are.” "We in law enforcement welcome the oversight, we welcome the accountability, because we realize we need to be held to a higher standard,” Reyes said. "So we're here to promise this community to do better, because that's what we're called to do.” Reyes said this moment is an opportunity for everyone to do better, to engage each other better in policy, community relations and in healing the community. "We've gained a lot of trust in our community and incidents like this erode the trust the community has in its police department,” he said. "It doesn't matter that it happened by another officer. When an incident happens it erodes the image of every police officer. That's what's unique about this profession.” Reyes asked all law enforcement, community leaders and officials be part of the solution and the healing. "To all law enforcement, this isn't a time to stand back, but to be leaders,” he said. "Let's improve relations and rebuild the trust that was lost yesterday.” When Leng pledged late Tuesday evening to be as transparent as possible as the state investigation into the officer-involved shooting continued, he said: "Every time a gun is fired in our community, it has my concern and my immediate attention. "Protecting as many people as we can, while also preventing as much crime and violence as possible, is arguably the core function of our hometown,” he said. Leng said in his statement the incident is being "investigated with the utmost seriousness that it deserves.” "I intend to share the results of this investigation, and any other appropriate information in the coming days, to make the process as transparent as possible within the restrictions of a State investigation,” said Leng. "I commit to all today that I will continue this discussion and work together with Hamden's community leaders, law enforcement officials, clergy, and human rights counselors and advocacy groups in an effort to ensure that Hamden provides all people with the very best Police Services possible.” State Police Trooper Josue Dorelus said Tuesday that officers fired after the driver of the vehicle, a suspect in the alleged robbery, "exited the vehicle in an abrupt manner” and turned toward them. No weapon was found in the vehicle, Dorelus said, although a detailed search of the vehicle had not yet been completed when he spoke. No one is seen exiting the vehicle in surveillance video that circulated in the press and the community Tuesday. In that clip, a Hamden officer appears to bring his car to a stop, get out, and fire toward the passenger-side door of the vehicle. Also Tuesday evening — in a protest inside and outside the Hamden Police Department on Dixwell Avenue — social activists, friends of Stephanie Washington and relatives of other's involved in police-involved shooting victims on the department to release the name of the officers involved, body camera footage and to fire the officer who shot the woman. "No justice, no peace, no racist police,” the crowd chanted, with as many as 100 people participating in the rally. "We're being treated like our lives don't matter,” protest leader Remidy Shareef, of Hamden, said. After some time protesting on the sidewalk outside the department, the crowd moved inside to the lobby and demanded answers from police. Deputy Chief Bo Kicak came out from behind the front desk bulletproof glass to talk with activists and explain no information could be shared because the investigation is in the hands of state police. Much of the crowd continued to rally in New Haven near the site of the shooting, where Harp, Reyes, Leng and Cappiello addressed the crowd Tuesday evening. mdignan@hearstmediact.com; william.lambert@hearstmediact.com New Haven Register Insider Thumbnail Collection See the Insider homepage Mohegan Sun, Foxwoods get closer to old normal as they ramp up BY Joe Amarante Jacobs: 'Wild week' ahead for UConn trustee, Travelers exec BY Jeff Jacobs Hearst investigation: Bankruptcy cases plunge during pandemic BY Mark Albert Montgomery will sit out WNBA season to focus on social justice...
