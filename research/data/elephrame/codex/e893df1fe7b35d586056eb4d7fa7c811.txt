The march began at the NC State Belltower and followed Hillsborough Street to the North Carolina State Capitol building where individuals spoke about grievances and issues facing schools and communities in North Carolina and the nation. Elizabeth Byers Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save NC State students gathered at the Belltower Monday afternoon to kick-off the "Reclaim MLK Rally and March,” one of the many Triangle events that took place Monday to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day. The march, which was organized by the UNC Black Congress and involved students from NC State, UNC-Chapel Hill and other universities, went from the Belltower to the North Carolina State Capitol downtown."I think one of the best things about the event is that it brought together students from various campuses such as NC State and UNC-Chapel Hill,” said Kinesha Harris, a senior studying science, technology and society, in an email. "There are many issues that are experienced by students at our various campuses that are common between them and because there is strength in numbers, having more of us together gives us a stronger support system and more platforms for our message.” The march was organized entirely by students, which some found to be powerful and inspiring."Student leaders from across the region expressed discontent, made powerful speeches and helped organize a march downtown from the Belltower,” said Student Government Chief of Staff Colin Beamer, a senior studying political science, in an email. "But what stood out to me more was the way in which each individual maintained Dr. King's legacy of passionate action.”In addition to honoring King, the event also highlighted current issues, such as police brutality and LGBT rights, among other things, according to WNCN."This is just the start though,” said Student Body President and senior studying materials science and engineering Paul Nolan, in an interview with WNCN.* "We have work to do. It's going to be a long couple of years ahead of us, but you know it's been a long many years behind us as well. We have work to do but we are moving forward.”Beamer echoed Nolan's acknowledgement of the necessity to move forward and continue working."I was inspired to not remain silent because so many communities of color face daunting realities which I will never encounter because of my privilege,” Beamer said.Harris emphasized how particularly fitting the student-organized march was, citing how important students are in the fight for civil rights."In the spirit of Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and those who were instrumental in the Civil Rights Movement, there was a great deal of involvement from college students, specifically students from NC A&T State University in Greensboro holding sit-ins at a lunch counter and students at Shaw University in Raleigh forming the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC),” Harris said. "I believe that it is our responsibility to follow in their footsteps and continue their work as college students to fight against injustice and oppression in our communities.” There were many other events hosted in the Triangle Monday including the 37th annual MLK Memorial Day March, which took place in downtown Raleigh Monday morning. Marchers lined up at 10 a.m. at the Capitol building and continued to march until noon, singing songs such as "We Shall Overcome.”"The march was well-organized,” said Graham Whitehouse, a junior studying biomedical engineering. "It was a fun time, just to walk through downtown Raleigh in remembrance of a man who did so much for America.”Whitehouse also talked about the small number of non-African-Americans who participated in the event."Personally, I was disappointed to see a small turnout from the white community,” Whitehouse said. "Although Martin Luther King Jr. is most acclaimed and known for advancing the civil rights of African-Americans and people of color, I think that everyone should take time to recognize his contribution to modern society. It is a national holiday for a reason.”The Triangle Martin Luther King, Jr. Committee also organized events to celebrate the late civil rights leader. This year's theme was "Where Do We Go From Here?” lamenting on grievances following the results of the presidential race.The Greater Raleigh Chamber of Commerce hosted the 37th annual Triangle Interfaith Prayer Breakfast on Monday at the Sheraton Imperial Hotel in Durham. The event included Christ Our King Community Church's Pastor James White as the keynote speaker, according to ABC11."It's not about America becoming great again ... but we go to a place where America can become greater than it's ever been,” White said.*Editor's Note: This article originally incorrectly attributed Paul Nolan's quote from WNCN.**This article was updated with additional context on Jan. 17 at 6:00p.m. Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Tags Mlk Raleigh Martin Luther King Holiday Durham Triangle Ncsu Belltower PRINTEDITION Facebook Twitter YouTube Instagram Sections Home News Sports Arts & Entertainment Opinion Multimedia Services About Us Contact Us Work For Us Submissions User Policies Advertise Affiliates Agromeck Nubian Message Windhover WKNC Contact Information technicianonline.com Campus Box 7318 Raleigh, NC 27695 Phone: 919-515-2411 Email: technician-editor@ncsu.edu © Copyright 2020 technicianonline.com, Campus Box 7318 Raleigh, NC | Terms of Use Powered by BLOX Content Management System from TownNews.com.
