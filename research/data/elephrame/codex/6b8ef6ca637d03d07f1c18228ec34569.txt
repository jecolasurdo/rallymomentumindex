She held a picture of her son during a standoff with officers on the bridge. The officers sat on their bikes as Coleman, flanked by Dalvin's brother and grandmother, stared back in silence while standing in the middle of the northbound lanes before continuing the march."I am willing to get arrested, of course. That's my son. If they arrest one, arrest us all," Coleman said. "I am not just here for my son but for all the others who have been killed. I urge people not to wait too long for this to happen to them. It can happen to anyone."Dalvin's grandmother, Pricilla Coleman, was briefly carried by family members when she was overcome with emotion that she could no longer walk."Put her on my back, put her on my back," one of the men said. "I've got her."With the support of her grandson's hands on her back, the group kept marching forward, chanting "Hands up, don't shoot.""It's a lot to my soul. It makes me feel like we're together in this. All of us. With this boy right here," Calvin Hollins said, pointing to the portrait in his hands of his son, Dalvin. "I wish we can all just understand what we cannot ... that we can bear what we cannot. Will there be Justice for Dalvin?"Jarvis Johnson, 26, was handcuffed and was let go after talking with police."They did their job," Johnson said when he came to rejoin the group. "They gave us a lot of leeway. As soon as we got in that street and started walking, all of us could have been arrested right then and there. But they let us walk from one end of the bridge to the other end of the bride.""I was upset, I'm not going to lie," he said, admitting that he had been combative when an officer tried to place him in handcuffs. "That officer twisted my arm and I thought he was going to break my arm. But then another officer got the sweat out of my eyes and offered me water."Johnson spoke to the crowd of the importance of not letting the actions of one bad officer represent the entire police department, the way that they would not want the actions of one African American represent the entire race.A woman wearing a homemade shirt with a thin blue line to represent her support for police interrupted Johnson as he spoke."I'm pro-blue and I wanted to say thank you," she said as they embraced. "You nailed it."Earlier Monday, the Tempe Police Department said in a statement that it's aware of the protest and "will have contingency plans in place should they be required.""There are no plans on the part of the city to divert or shut down traffic. Anyone who chooses to interfere with traffic is subject to potential arrest and booking into jail."

The officer was pursuing Hollins after a robbery of a nearby Walgreens, Tempe police said.Pharmacy employees said the robber simulated a weapon and announced that he had one. But authorities later said he was not armed. Hollins was shot in the back, according to police.Police say Lt. Edward Ouimette, one of the officers giving chase, saw Hollins turn toward him and perceived a threat, but Hollins turned away in the seconds before the fatal shot was fired.According to Tempe policy, Ouimette was placed on administrative leave while the shooting was investigated. Tempe Police Chief Sylvia Moir said she has reached out to the U.S. Department of Justice and regional partners for support in the shooting review.Protesters are marching northbound on bridge. Police are advising to get back on sidewalk. pic.twitter.com/bVsSuDY58M— Tempe Police (@TempePolice) September 26, 2016Those protesting Monday urged for Ouimette to resign or for Chief Sylvia Moir to fire him and to provide transparency on the investigation of Hollins' death."If they refuse, protests will intensify," Maupin said in a press release before the protest began. The group plans to gather and protest Tempe streets each Monday until the police department fires the officer or he resigns, Maupin said."We can never forget Dalvin," said Lataysha Kelly, Hollins' girlfriend. "Many people loved him and will continue to fight for answers. So we will be out here again and again until we get them."Check back with azcentral.com for updates.AZCENTRALWho is Jarrett Maupin?
