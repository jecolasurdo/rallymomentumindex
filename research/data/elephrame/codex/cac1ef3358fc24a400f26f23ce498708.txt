Capitol Ave. The attack in Charleston on Wednesday evening occurred at an AME church and took the lives of six women and three men.Despite the tragedy, there was a hopeful tone to the prayers during the local vigil."Love conquers all," said the Rev. Charles B. Jackson, pastor at St. John's. "Our strength is one another."Area groups such as the Ministerial Alliance of Springfield and Vicinity and the Springfield branch of the NAACP organized the vigil.The Rev. Glen VanderKloot, president of the ministerial alliance and pastor at Faith Lutheran Church, 2313 S. Whittier Ave., said it was important that the vigil be held at an AME church."I think it's important that we stand in solidarity with each other as we all mourn this tragic event," VanderKloot said. "I particularly encouraged it to be at one of the AME churches in town because it was their family that was struck."During the vigil, members of the audience prayed and asked for peace and forgiveness."God is listening. God can ease our minds and solve our problems," Jackson said as the service got underway.Teresa Haley, president of the local NAACP, said she received several calls Thursday asking if the group was going to organize some type if event since the Charleston shooting occurred at a black church."The NAACP holds a lot of their meetings in churches," Haley said. "When we were first starting the civil rights movement, it took place throughout the black churches because there was no place else for us to meet and organize."Other groups involved in organizing the vigil included the Greater Springfield Interfaith Association and the Faith Coalition for the Common Good."This gives us an opportunity to come together, pray for those individuals and also pray for our country and work together on finding other ways to heal when these events occur," Haley said.The shooting in Charleston has some local pastors thinking about security at their own churches.The Rev. Jerry Doss of Abundant Faith Christian Center, 2525 Taylor Ave., and the Rev. T. Ray McJunkins, senior pastor at Union Baptist Church, 1405 E. Monroe St., talked about church security during phone interviews prior to the vigil.Doss said he has asked himself several times if his church is prepared for such an emergency. They had a service Wednesday evening, which is the same time as the Charleston shooting."There were probably a hundred of us worshiping, praying and doing Bible study," he said. "This could easily happen to our church at Abundant Faith."Doss said there are people at Abundant Faith who have been working on security issues for several years. There are also police officers who are members of the congregation."We have a security team, and we have officers who attend our services, and many times they are armed," Doss said.McJunkins said Union Baptist has people who patrol the parking lot and lobby during worship services, but they aren't armed.Because of the recent shootings, he's thinking about stepping up the church's security to include off-duty officers or former officers who are licensed to carry firearms.While a racial hate crime is a possibility, McJunkins said people could target a church for other reasons."I have concerns about people who take mental illness lightly. ... I know what I'm saying from the pulpit when I'm teaching, but what is that person in the pew hearing?" McJunkins said.Deputy Chief Dennis Arnold of the Springfield Police Department said it isn't feasible to assign an officer to every church in the city. He added that in the next couple of weeks, the department will be having extra patrols in certain areas when possible."If we receive a credible threat, obviously, we would put extra patrols in that area," Arnold said.— Contact John Reynolds: john.reynolds@sj-r.com, 788-1524, twitter.com/JohnReynoldsSJR.
