Change the approach to policing that has resulted in claims of racial profiling on the north, east and south sides of Kalamazoo. Police leaders should attend a community led forum, and city commissioners should attend a forum to address racial inequity.In an interview after the rally, Kalamazoo Public Safety chief Jeffrey Hadley said his department is always willing to listen, and always willing to talk, to the community.Hadley had not yet been advised of the demands by rally leadership, who unveiled them to the group at the end of the two-hour event.Max T. Isaac, 23, a member of the Kalamazoo Chapter of Black Lives Matter and one of the organizers said the rally and shutdown action are the first steps in a strategic plan to push for change in Kalamazoo, with the list of demands accompanied by a timeline by which those demands should be met.The "shut down" blocking traffic on the one way mall street was to be an act of civil disobedience that would cause some discomfort as a way to drive home the point, Isaac said.Black Lives Matter rally reveals diverse support in Bronson ParkIsaac did not share the proposed timeline at the event.If people cooperate to end systemic racism, change can happen fairly quickly, he said."It's working with the police force, with elected officials, and businesses to accomplish our goals," he said."Ultimately the timing will depend on them," he said.Regarding the first demand, Hadley said an internal investigation into the death of James Ronald Dunigan, 57, is nearly finished and he will communicate its findings.The Kalamazoo man died in the back of a police cruiser after being discharged from Bronson Methodist Hospital early on the morning of May 6 and reportedly telling police he wanted to go to jail.Hadley said his department stands ready to work with any community group to address concerns about disparities, and acknowledged the work his officers put in every day to build relationships in the community."There was a shooting at Fox Ridge Apartments and the very next day they were there for a block party," he said.But he said he needs to hear more about concerns in the neighborhoods the rally participants claim are too frequently visited by police. Police are often responding to calls from crime victims who "request and require our presence there," he said. "We get caught between what some people want and what other people want."He said the rally had been a peaceful event, with no incidents of violence reported.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).Â© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
