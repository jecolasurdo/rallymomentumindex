Stand your ground rally and protest seek justice for McGlockton By Spectrum News Staff Pinellas County PUBLISHED 8:06 AM ET Aug. 05, 2018 PUBLISHED August 5, 2018 @8:06 AM SHARE CLEARWATER, Fla. -- Civil rights leader Reverend Al Sharpton is leading a rally Sunday calling for an arrest in the controversial stand your ground shooting out of Clearwater. Stand your ground rally and protest held Sunday Events seek justice for Markeis McGlockton Rally and protest start at 4 p.m. in Clearwater This protest is the latest call for action in what's been nearly three weeks of rallies, more than 45,000 online signatures, and town hall discussions since the shooting death of Markeis McGlockton on July 19. McGlockton was shot and killed in a convenience store parking lot over an argument about a parking space. The Pinellas Sheriff says according to Florida's stand your ground law, he cannot arrest alleged gunman Michael Drejka. The case has been handed over to the state attorney to decide if charges will be filed against Drejka. Sharpton is calling for an independent investigation into the shooting death of McGlockton. Hundreds of people are expected to join the activist today as he speaks about the latest stand your ground case. The rally will start at 4 p.m. at the St. John Primitive Baptist Church in Clearwater, just over a mile away from where the fatal shooting happened. A March for Justice, organized by Black Lives Matter Tampa, is also being held today. The event is from 4 - 6 p.m. and will take place across the street from the St. John Primitive Baptist Church. The two events will likely become one, continuing the conversation of this controversial law. Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum and former Miami Beach Mayor Phillip Levine also plan to attend the event today.
