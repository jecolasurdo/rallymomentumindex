HaysIndyStarAs the sun was setting and the national anthem was sung, students, protesters and Indianapolis residents took a knee outside the gates at the North Central High School football fields.They hung neon-colored signs bearing messages written in thick black marker."United we stand, divided we fall." "Racism is no joke." "Silence is violence."The protest during the national anthem before the North Central-Pike High School football game Friday night came after students saw their classmates share a "Confederate lives matter" photo on social media.Two pictures apparently taken from Snapchat — and later circulated through Facebook and Twitter — show the presence of a Confederate flag at a recent party. In one photo, four white teenagers are smiling while holding up the flag. Another showed an American flag alongside the Confederate flag, and the faces of a few teenagers, one of whom is black.It contained the caption, "Confederate lives matter," seemingly mocking the Black Lives Matter movement."This is not OK," said 17-year-old Nicodemus Monts. IndyStar interviewed Nicodemus, his mother, RoTonjia Monts, and his pastor, the Rev. Michael Drane, in a conference call Friday.Nicodemus, a senior, said he recognized the teenagers as his classmates at North Central High School. He was offended after seeing the photographs Thursday night on Twitter."My main concern was to try to stop it," Nicodemus said. "I wanted to make sure the people that posted it knew it wasn't OK and it was wrong."The images have been widely shared on social media. Nicodemus shared the images as well as his concerns, but he said Facebook took down his post after others complained.The images are still visible in other posts. Some comments appear to suggest that the students at the party were trying to be funny. The Confederate flag, according to some comments, was burned not long after the pictures were taken.Two North Central students reached out to IndyStar to defend the actions of their classmates, saying the students have since apologized for the pictures."The students in the picture do not support anything having to do with the flag, and have apologized for their actions of posing with the flag," one email read. "The students also have multiple African American friends, many of whom were present at the party."Even if the students at the party did not intend to be racist, Nicodemus said, the photos were hurtful."People are messaging me saying it was just a regular party and they didn't mean anything by it, that the Confederate flag was burned at the end," he said. "But you posed with the flag. You said 'Confederate lives matter.'"There are no second chances with the internet."Washington Township Schools are on fall break this week. Spokeswoman Ellen Rogers released a statement Friday afternoon: "We are aware of the allegations made regarding an adolescent gathering that may have involved students from our district. The incident in question happened outside of school during fall break, and at this time, we are not sure if the students were all from our district. When students return to school on Monday, we will work through the situation with the students impacted by the incident."Nicodemus organized a "Student Solidarity Action" at Friday's game, encouraging participants to kneel during the national anthem — a form of protest popularized by San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick.Peggy Desautels Meyer, 56, said she was "angry" when she saw the posts. She came to protest in solidarity with Nicodemus."Anger can be a good thing; it is a good thing," she said. "All it is is energy to move forward. It propels, hopefully, propels people to move forward in creating change."She said it's important not to ignore the photos."At this point, we just want to bring awareness to the fact that it happened and it's not OK," she said.Keyla Jones, 42, came to the protest with her 10-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son."I'm a North Central alum, so I find it really shocking, the behavior," she said. "I realize that it is fall break, but I also understand that, in this day and age, we have 24/7 access to various forms of media, so I was really disappointed that there had been no communication. It was almost like it was being swept under the rug."She said it was important for her to bring her children as a way to show them that not only do their lives matter, but their voices do, too."We have these great discussions at home, my husband and my children, but I think that sometimes it has to go beyond just a discussion; there has to be some active participation," she said. "So this was an opportunity for them to participate in a very peaceful way."To see a 17-year-old, who she said isn't much older than her own children, organize a protest made her feel hopeful."It's so inspiring," she said. "I think he is a radically brave young man, and I'm so very impressed by him, and I'm excited, if this is what my future looks like."Nicodemus said he doesn't want to get his classmates in trouble, but he wants them to realize they were wrong."I'm very proud of him for taking a stand," RoTonjia Monts said. "We don't want to bring embarrassment on the families. We don't want to bring embarrassment on the school. We want a conversation to start."Drane, pastor at The House of Joy, 3620 E. 38th St., said he hopes school officials take action."Washington Township has a role in making sure students who graduate are culturally competent," Drane said. "Not taking it seriously makes them complicit."Call IndyStar reporter Vic Ryckaert at (317) 444-2701. Follow him on Twitter:@VicRyc.Call IndyStar reporter Holly Hays at (317) 444-6156.
