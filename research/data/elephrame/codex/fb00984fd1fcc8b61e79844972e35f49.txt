A photo from the scene of the protest shows several people with signs marching down State Street with cars slowed behind them. The protesters later blocked the on-ramp that leads from 500 South to I-15 and I-80 for a few minutes. Police arrived shortly after the on-ramp was blocked, and at that point the protesters moved on. They then blocked the freeway off-ramp from I-15/I-80 at 600 South. They moved again, around when police arrived at that location around 8 p.m. There were about two dozen people protesting. A similar protest two weeks ago was attended by hundreds and shut down a few streets in Salt Lake City for several hours. Copyright 2020 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
