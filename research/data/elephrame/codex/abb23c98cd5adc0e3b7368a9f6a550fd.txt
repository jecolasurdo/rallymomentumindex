"What we are trying to say is what we are doing out here is more important than what's going on in there,” protest spokesman Abijah Archer told USA TODAY Sports. "We need the city and the state to value our lives more than this game.”The protest was populated by a coalition of various interest and action groups, from those speaking out for racial equality to teachers and workers rights groups.More protests are planned throughout Super Bowl week.PHOTOS: Super Bowl Opening Night About Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Corrections Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Terms of Service Your California Privacy Rights/Privacy Policy Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info/Cookie PolicyContact Us Help Center My Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop Reprints & Permissions Advertise Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Pinterest YouTube Reddit Flipboard RSS10Best Grateful Reviewed Thanksgiving.com Job Network Moonlighting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett ClassifiedsThe City The Wall Storytellers© 2020 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC.
