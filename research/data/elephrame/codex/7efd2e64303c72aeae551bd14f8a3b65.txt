(SPECTRUM NEWS) — As the sound of chanting voices approached, people appeared in their doorways, cell phone in hand, filming the group as it passed by. A little while later, three children stood on the sill of a kitchen window peering around the curtains. All were watching a group of about 150 protesters walk through the streets of De Pere Wednesday evening. The protest was intended to bring the calls for police reform and sweeping racial change in the country directly to people who may have otherwise been untouched by marches in larger cities and communities. "It is great to start in these small communities. We can get together and protest for two hours. It's still accomplishing something, it's still getting a message across,” said Hannah Lundin, the protest organizer — who is also a De Pere native and resident. "The goal is always peaceful and powerful. It starts here.” As protests sparked by the death of George Floyd reach the end of their second week, organizers and participants say change is happening and their voices are being taken seriously. It's a movement that has momentum -- and they are working to keep it going. "Every little conversation you can have, and all the social media, will keep it going,” said Vicky Shier, a protester from De Pere. "I think on the grander scale, things have happened at such a large plateau - or a large peak - that you can't ignore those bigger things anymore.” There's a lot happening with the movement, with many different goals, discussions and aims of protestors around the state, nation and world. Through it all, Lundin has a simple desire. "That one person wakes up. One person wakes up, hears the message and makes a difference in someone else's life."
