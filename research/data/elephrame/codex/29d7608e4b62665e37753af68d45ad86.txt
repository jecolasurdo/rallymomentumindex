Photo: Chuck Bennett, for SCNG Show Caption of Expand Several hundred protesters gathered at Torrance City Hall, Sunday, May 31, hours after municipal officials enacted a curfew and state of emergency in response to overnight protests that in some cases turned into riots and looting in Los Angeles and cities across the nation. The peaceful, multi-generational gathering grew from an initial small group over the first hour of the protest held in front of the civic center, where demonstrators lay on the lawn in front of the civic center, propping up signs bearing such slogans as "Black Lives Matter, "Say His Name” and "Injustice Anywhere is a Threat to Justice Everywhere.” Motorists passing the intersection of Torrance Boulevard and Madrona Avenue honked enthusiastically, while nearby residents stood on sidewalks in front of them homes to witness a sight unusual for its scale in conservative Torrance. "I'm sick of all this kind of thing in my country,” said 75-year-old Lomita resident and Vietnam War veteran Clifford Rapp as he protested with his wife. "We just need hard-core unity in this country,” he added. "All lives matter.” Scores of Southern California protests have been staged in the wake of the killing of George Floyd by a former Minneapolis police officer. Floyd, a black man, died Monday after a white Minneapolis police officer — who was later fired and faces criminal charges — was caught on video pressing his knee into his neck until he stopped breathing. Torrance's curfew, which began at midnight Sunday, is now in force from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. daily; Torrance officials updated their curfew hours late Sunday to stay consistent with a new county order issued to curb lawlessness.

Reports of a 1 p.m. Sunday protest at Torrance City Hall began circulating on NextDoor and other social media platforms Saturday. Torrance police, who did not have a large visible presence at the demonstration, texted a message to the community Sunday evening denouncing Floyd's death. "We, at the Torrance Police Department, are incredibly disturbed and saddened by the death of George Floyd in Minnesota,” Police Chief Eve Berg said in a statement. "The actions of the officers are deplorable and violate the public trust we have worked so hard to build within the Torrance community. "We train to de-escalate a situation whenever possible, and to only use the amount of force necessary to perform our duties,” she added. "We will not tolerate in our ranks anyone who does not live up to these standards. Redondo Beach mom Aggie Kurzyna attended the protest with her 10-year-old daughter and son. "It's important for us to stand with our black brothers and sisters and demand justice and equality for black lives,” said Kurzyna, who was wearing a black t-shirt emblazoned with the slogan, "I Will Stand Up For You.” "Unfortunately, black people are not free in this country,” she added. "We want to be there and support them and make a difference.” Unrest has hit cities around the world in the wake of Floyd's death, with frustrated protesters taking to the cities to protest against the backdrop of a global economic crisis that has left millions jobless as the coronavirus pandemic rages. ⁦@TorranceCA⁩ #GeorgeFloydProtests.

"We support and uphold the First Amendment right on freedom of speech and to peacefully assemble and to protest, Berg said. "However, we do not condone the illegal activities of rioting, looting, physically harming others, and the destruction of property. "Please know that we have sufficient staffing and specific plans in place to keep the Torrance community safe during times like these that we are currently experiencing,” she added. The incident was just the latest in a series of violent altercations between police officers and minorities that has sparked the Black Lives Matter movement. Torrance is no stranger to such protests. Black Lives Matter protesters spent much of the last year attending and, in some cases disrupting, Torrance City Council meetings in the wake of the December 2019 death of a black man by Torrance police officers.

Torrance, a conservative community where blacks make up less than 3 percent of the population, has long had a reputation for being tough on crime, while it is also known for tenaciously defending itself against lawsuits filed against its police department.
