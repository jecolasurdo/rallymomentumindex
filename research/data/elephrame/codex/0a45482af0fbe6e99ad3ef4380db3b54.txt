Dad-of-two George Floyd died after a white officer knelt on his neck for several minutes in Minneapolis on Monday. The 46-year-old was being arrested after he allegedly tried to use a fake $20 bill at a corner shop, while police claim he was "under the influence" in the driver's seat of a car. A video of the incident shows Mr Floyd begging: "Please, I can't breathe” and "Don't kill me”.

Organisers have assured that social distancing will be 'enforced' when the gathering takes place on Sunday, June 7. They have also urged people show symptoms of coronavirus should not attend.

"It is essential we recognise that the UK also has built itself on crimes just as severe, past and present. This is not new and black people have fallen victim to a system that only exists to create class division and racial segregation. It adds: "This is not an All Lives Matter protest and we ask specifically that that is not rhetoric brought here. It is important that we show social distancing rule here also to comply with the current pandemic and we must enforce that this is paramount when attending. "Please do not attend if you have shown signs of Covid-19 or have been in contact with others who have.” A large crowd of people are expected to turn up for the protest, with organisers suggesting that social distancing will be 'enforced' (Image: Getty Images) It remains unclear how social distancing rules will be enforced by organisers, but plans are expected to be released later next week. Calvin Smith, who is listed as one of the hosts of the Facebook event, said: "We strongly advise if you are in attendance to this event that you bring masks and any appropriate protective wear. If you are attending in a group setting then please stick to your own group and keep adequate social distancing. "We will post social distancing ruling throughout the week.” Protests over George Floyd's death have since spilled into at least 30 cities in 23 US states, with violent clashes breaking out between demonstrators and police in riot gear. President Donald Trump has been slammed for his response to the protests with Twitter hiding one of his tweets. He wrote: "I can't stand back and watch this happen to a great American City, Minneapolis. A total lack of leadership. Either the very weak Radical Left Mayor, Jacob Frey, get his act together and bring the City under control, or I will send in the National Guard and get the job done right.

Just spoke to Governor Tim Walz and told him that the Military is with him all the way. Any difficulty and we will assume control but, when the looting starts, the shooting starts. Thanks you.” The social media giant said the tweet "violated Twitter rules about glorifying violence” but deemed it to be in the public interest to keep it accessible. Hundreds of people gathered in Trafalgar Square in London on Sunday as violence continues to escalate across the Atlantic. Protesters in the UK capital could be heard chanting "I can't breathe" - echoing the words of George Floyd before his death. Police officer Derek Chauvin, 44, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in connection with Floyd's death.TheScottishDailyRecordFollow @Daily_RecordMore
