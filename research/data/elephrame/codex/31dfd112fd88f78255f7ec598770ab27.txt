For a couple hours, the tension seemed to ease and crowds thinned. But as it grew dark, protesters spread to the Near East Side, the Short North and Downtown. Tensions rose again. Construction material and a vehicle were set on fire at Oak Street near 5th Street. Windows were broken on the east side of Downtown. Protesters faced off with officers. Chairs and other material was set on fire inside the ADAMH building on East Broad Street. Protesters threw rocks through the window at the Egan-Ryan Funeral Home east of Downtown and windows were broken at the Columbus College of Art and Design. The Ohio National Guard has been called in to assist, especially approaching a 10 p.m. citywide curfew. ORIGINAL STORY: For a third straight day, protesters converged on Downtown to demonstrate over the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. Saturday's daytime protest drew more people — at least an estimated 2,000 — but was more peaceful than Friday night, when windows of many Downtown businesses were broken and protesters faced off with police until the early morning hours. Gov. Mike DeWine and Mayor Andrew J. Ginther have called a press conference for 5 p.m. to discuss the protests in Columbus and other cities across the state. The few hundred protesters remaining Downtown by 3:30 p.m. had begun to march toward City Hall. Before they left protesters hurled full water bottles at officers in the intersection of Broad and High Streets. Police returned that with tear gas canisters and the crowd dispersed. Before that officials declared an for Downtown, and residents were told to stay out of the area. Devon White of Cleveland and David Scales of Columbus organized the protest, which began at 10 a.m. "This is a peaceful protest,” White said. "We aren't here to break (stuff). I talked to the police and told them we want to go home safe and we wanted them to go home safe.” Scales and White addressed the crowd of a few hundred people through bullhorns. Protesters then walked a few laps around the Statehouse chanting "Black Lives Matter” and "No justice no peace! No racist police!” By 10:30, the crowd had swelled to the thousands. Scales said the group tried to get a permit for the protest but were advised by their attorneys not to do so and to just keep people moving. Scales said he hoped that the crowd remained peaceful and said the goal of the protest was to raise awareness and stop racism. "Listen, I am a homosexual man, so I know well what a riot and protest can do,” he said. "I know riots throughout our history are sometimes needed.” A raw and angry crowd kept swelling, and by 11:15 a.m., some people tried to shut down traffic at the intersection of Broad and High streets. "Just let us have the street!” said Stephen Worthy, 27, who was yelling at officers. "We just want the (expletive) street.” Columbus City Council President Shannon Hardin, Franklin County Commissioner Kevin Boyce and Congresswoman Joyce Beatty were present for much of the protest. "People are tired. They're angry. They're frustrated, and they're exhausted,” Hardin said. "Folks see blatant racism in Columbus as well, and they are demanding change.” About 20 minutes later, Hardin and Beatty were trying to de-escalate an arrest when an officer deployed pepper spray. That sent the crowd scattering, including the three elected officials. "The underlying issue here is racism ...,” Boyce said. "There were black people, white people, Asian people, Hispanic people ... men and women. The vast majority of them listed racism (on signs) as something that was part of this conversation we're having.” By midday, scattered arrests had been made as protesters crossed police lines or made physical contact with officers. Hours after Boyce was hit with the pepper spray, he was still trying to wash it off. "I'm still burning,” he told The Dispatch. "My hair is burning. My skin is burning. My eyes are burning. We were there simply trying to encourage peaceful protest and make sure that those folks knew they were being heard.” Boyce said that he, Beatty and Hardin were near Broad and High among a crowd that was growing and spilling from the sidewalk onto the street when he witnessed an officer shove the face of a woman. "Before I knew it, they just sprayed everybody,” he said. "... Everything I saw up to that point was a peaceful protest, with people walking around and really talking about the racism that exists. ... I do believe that the scenario that I witnessed, they were out of line. The police officer who hit the young lady was out of line.” After getting sprayed, Hardin hit his knees and grabbed his face. He said he was OK as a stranger dumped milk into his eyes and told him to blink. The milk was to help ease the burning from the pepper spray. "I'm OK, I'm OK,” Hardin said. "That's awful.” The situation intensified when a commanding officer on the city's police bike unit gave the order to block the crosswalk at the southwest corner of Broad and High. Officers were heard openly questioning the order; one said it didn't make sense. The officers allowed people to cross for a brief period but then tried to seal off access. Two minutes later, pepper spray from police hit people trying to cross Broad Street and head north. There were numerous white, young protesters yelling vile things at officers. One protester came 10 inches from an officer's face as he was moving his bike and hurled a racist insult at him. Officers doused the crowd with pepper spray again when dozens of people tried to sit in the middle of High Street facing north. Similar scenes played out over and over as protesters stood on Broad and High. Each time there was spray, it sent people scurrying and collapsing, gasping for air. There was some organization behind the protest, because every time police deployed pepper spray, several people carrying an eye-clearing solution, water, milk and eye drops approached to help those sprayed. Andy Graham, 32, of Columbus, was on the receiving end of pepper spray earlier in the day. A woman ran up to give him milk to splash on his face. "Obviously, COVID-19 is a big worry. I've been trying to keep my distance from everyone as much as possible. This (protest) is still something that's very important, and we shouldn't be distracted from it,” he said. "I haven't seen a single protester do anything violent at all. And they just sprayed us all.” Saturday's protest followed a tense night between police and several hundred protesters. After a peaceful protest at Lockbourne Road and Livingston Avenue, other demonstrators marched to the Columbus Division of Police headquarters Downtown and then scattered throughout Downtown and the Short North. Many marched peacefully, some shouting at police as they walked. But small bands of people pushed back against officers trying to clear the streets. Others threw water bottles, rocks and fireworks at officers. Police used pepper spray and reportedly rubber bullets to push back the protesters. Around 10 p.m., officers declared an emergency and told people they had to leave the area. That's when groups of protesters scattered, spray-painting buildings and breaking windows of businesses Downtown and in the Short North. That carried on into early Saturday morning. "The Columbus Police declared an emergency Downtown to manage protests near the Statehouse. We are asking residents to avoid the area. Safety of everyone — protesters and police — is paramount. We're calling for everyone to remain calm,” Mayor Andrew J. Ginther tweeted just after 1:30 p.m. Saturday. Requests for comment were sent to Columbus police and the mayor's office. No comment was immediately provided to The Dispatch. In other major cities, including Atlanta, the police chief has visited protesters to try to bring a sense of calm. On Friday evening, Columbus Police Chief Thomas Quinlan published a scripted video on social media. He said police were listening to the community's concerns and embrace ideas for progressive policing. "It is sad to see what happened in our community. Our community deserves better,” he said. Columbus Police said five people were arrested Friday for setting off fireworks and inducing panic, and two officers were injured by protesters throwing rocks and bricks at them. Police reported windows broken in the Short North. Hundreds of protesters marched through Downtown, with one waving a "Black Lives Matter” flag and another holding a sign that said "The World Is Watching.” At Broad and High, the crowd chanted "No Justice; No Peace,” "I can't breathe” and "Get that Animal off that Horse” as police tried to move them off the street. Joseph Golden stumbled toward the northwest corner of Broad and High after taking a direct hit of spray in the eyes. He dumped a jug of water over his head. "I wasn't even in your way!” Golden yelled toward police. Just to the south on High Street, Katelind Gorman of Olde Towne East was holding a sign that said "May God Be With You Always." "I don't hate police officers,” she said. But she felt she needed to be Downtown. With her was Loren Jameal Gwynn. "I thought it was going to be peaceful,” Gwynn said. As police pushed protesters east on Broad Street, Delaney Mixer followed. A teacher at KIPP Columbus High School, she said she came because "I don't want to see my kids killed like George Floyd.” She held a sign that said, "Why are my students afraid of you?” Dispatch Reporters Mark Ferenchik and Catherine Candisky contributed to this story. lsullivan@dispatch.com @dispatchsully mkovac@dispatch.com @ohiocapitalblog bburger@dispatch.com @ByBethBurger Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you.
