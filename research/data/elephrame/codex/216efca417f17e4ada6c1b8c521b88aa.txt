The rally began around 2:30 p.m. -- and was set to kick off a march to the Federal Courthouse where Rev. Jesse Jackson would speak about the Hamilton case. The march began just before 3 p.m. Reverend Jesse Jackson hopes to bring more attention to the death of Dontre Hamilton. 31-year-old Hamilton was shot and killed by former Milwaukee Police Officer Christopher Manney on April 30th. Last week, Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm announced Manney won't face criminal charges in connection with Hamilton's death. Manney has been fired, but Jackson is seeking to get charges against the former officer. The protesters took to Red Arrow Park with a palpable energy, it seems they're optimistic about the future. Skaters at the park were rocked with chants and a mass of protesters wanting their voices to be heard. It's the attention locally and now nationally that supporters of Dontre Hamilton want. "The more attention that comes to the fight, the bigger the opportunity that brings light to the issue and hopefully ultimately get charges pressed against this officer in this case and the city of Milwaukee police department," said Curtis Sails, Co-chairman for Coalition for Justice. As they stood in solidarity, about 100 people rallied for justice for Dontre Hamilton prior to a press conference from Reverend Jesse Jackson. "Looking forward to a new year and a new opportunity to fight for justice and justice in our city," said Sails. The fury over the District Attorney's decision continues to fester, but with Reverend Jackson's recent involvement, a federal review is now underway -- an attitude of optimism was present. "Our city, our state has not been effectively doing its job when it comes to investigating police forces, their patterns, and their practices and now we are taking it to a federal level and that's what we are doing today to bring attention to it," said Sails. So the protesters took to the streets marching for Hamilton and issues that go beyond. Supporters are hoping that if they get justice for Dontre, there could be the opportunity to re-open some of the other cases that they feel the District Attorney has gotten wrong, such as Corey Stingley and Darius Simmons. "Those issues are not just the injustice but the economic injustice, the wage injustice, so many injustices that put us in the position to have to fight. But we have to fight collectively," said Nate Hamilton, Dontre Hamilton's brother. The group of protesters plan to discuss their next plan of action after the march.

They can say what ever they want, but if you are white you have to keep your mouth shut. January 2, 2015 at 9:39 pm the sad truth Where was his family all those years he was on the streets? #itsallaboutthebenjaminsbaby January 2, 2015 at 6:07 pm GetaJob Agreed! Plenty of FREE social services in Milwaukee for anyone to get help (MKE is KNOWN for it, I work downtown and communicate on a regular basis with the beat cops). Looks like last picture family had of him is a PROM picture? Maybe I'm wrong, but that's what it looks like. Um, your son was in his thirty's January 2, 2015 at 6:19 pm GetaJob Nate Hamilton the face of a "new civil rights movement” in Milwaukee? Other then being the brother of Dontre Hamilton, what credibility does he have? Education? Get off the news, you are an embarrassment to the city. January 2, 2015 at 6:11 pm Funnyhowitgoes In addition to "black Lives Matter” signs I would like to see signs up ” Respect Matters”, "Working Matters”, "knowing your father matters”, "Marriage Matters”. January 2, 2015 at 7:54 pm Funnyhowitgoes Of course it wouldn't matter because we already know blacks themselves don't believe black lives matter. January 2, 2015 at 7:57 pm Sheila Moyet Got that right! January 2, 2015 at 9:35 pm Gallactic President Superstar McAwesomevile I'm going to attend the next protest. I think it's BS that Suh got away with stomping on Rodgers' leg without a suspension. I'm going with a sign that says "Rodgers leg matters.” Hopefully we can take this to a federal level and get Suh the suspension he deserves!! #RodgersLegMatters January 2, 2015 at 8:47 pm jones Awesome. I'll be there . Chanting no sue for you!!! January 2, 2015 at 9:04 pm ASTRALOPITHICUS AURELIUS TASMANIUS Ah protesters have nothing to do but to protest the protesting of protesters. Once the reverened is gone they will go back to their hood and chill wit their homies. This has nothing to do with the peaced out officer shootin da dantre a bakers dozen times.. I mean ya'll know in da hood when yall go shootin yous empty dat tech 9 into yo neighbors house fo fun... so don't beat da officer for shootin da perp multiple times. We should make this into a learning moment regarding the physical aspects of projectiles and speed of sound, a bullet travels over 1000 mph which if it had enough energy it could travel from la to ny in 3 hours. The distance from the perp to the peace officer was a mere 10 feet so the time to reach the target in this situation was: Gravity pulls down 33 feet/second. if you shoot level from shoulder about 6 foot above ground the bullet will drop the 6 foot in about 1/5 second, therefore it would reach the perp in milliseconds. So don't go shootin in da hood. Leave da shootin up to da peace officers taking down offending perps. January 2, 2015 at 9:23 pm Sheila Moyet Oh are we back to this again. Come on media...give us a break! January 2, 2015 at 9:34 pm Nathan James Police should have drug sniffing dogs at the these social gatherings January 3, 2015 at 12:47 am Sheila Moyet These bleeding heart white liberals are such a joke. They have this need to show how much they support the blacks. Let them go into the hood and show their support. Wait until they become a victim of some black thug, and then they will sing a different song. May 1, 2015 at 8:10 am Comments are closed.
