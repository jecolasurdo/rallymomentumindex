Advertisement San Francisco ACLU Displaying Mario Woods Protest Banners Near Super Bowl City Photo: Rebecca Farmer/ACLU by Geri Koeppel @gerikoeppel February 6, 2016 The ACLU on Friday afternoon hung large banners reading, "BLACK LIVES MATTER" and "JUSTICE FOR MARIO WOODS" in its offices at 39 Drumm St. (between California and Sacramento Streets), a half a block from one of the entrances to Super Bowl Cityâ€”where a protest on the same issue took place a week ago. The group sent us a statement reading, in part, "There are long-standing and deep-rooted failures in the workings of the SFPD, especially as it interacts with communities of color, and Black people in particular."
