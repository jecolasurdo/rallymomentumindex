Arrests made in police station sit-inTonya Maxwell and Abigail Margulis, The Citizen-Times Published 1:44 p.m. ET July 22, 2016 | Updated 2:19 p.m. ET Aug. 6, 2016Community members and organizers from Showing Up for Racial Justice hold up a Black Lives Matter sign outside the Asheville Police Department Thursday morning July 21, 2016. Organizers planned to sit inside the station's lobby until the police meet their demands - accountability in the killing of Jerry "Jai" Williams and an end to police violence towards people of color - or until they were arrested.(Photo: Citizen Times)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREASHEVILLE - Police on Friday afternoon arrested seven protesters and one journalist who would not abandon a sit-in at the police station, one that came in response to the July 2 fatal shooting of an African-American man by an officer.The protesters on Thursday morning placed a Black Lives Matter banner on the building and had been in the front and foyer area of the station until about 3 p.m. Friday afternoon, when police made the arrests.Three times beginning Friday morning, police warned protesters they could be charged if they remained on site, said Capt. Stony Gonce.Just before the arrests, he told protesters they would be placed in custody and several left, Gonce said.Each of the eight that remained were arrested without incident and charged in violation of N.C. G.S. 14-132, according to a news release sent by APD spokeswoman Christina Hallingse following the arrests.The arrested protesters were each charged with one misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct in and injuries to a public building, according to court paperwork Saturday.Those arrested signed a written promise to appear in Buncombe County District Court on Sept. 8, warrants state. None were detained at the Buncombe County Detention Facility.Warrants state, some protesters "willfully did commit any nuisance in or near any public building or facility (by) blocking entrance to and walk ways to the Asheville Police Department from inside the building and by hanging banners outside the doorway."Other protesters, "blocked the entrance way, exit way inside the building and the lobby of the Asheville Police Department," warrants state.Hillary Helen Brown, 28, Michael Richard Collins, 28, Whitney Eichner, 32, Laura Maria Eshelman, 31, Rebecca Lynn Nippes, 26, and Adrienne Nicole Sigmon, 33, of Asheville were arrested at the police station. All the arrested protesters were from Asheville or surrounding areas.Also arrested was Daniel Michael Hesse, 38, a reporter for Mountain Xpress. The charges were dropped by the District Attorney's Office on July 29.An eighth person was arrested but that person's name was not available immediately following the arrests.The group was seeking an apology from Asheville Police Chief Tammy Hooper regarding the shooting death of Jai "Jerry” Williams, and also wanted the officer who shot him, Sgt. Tyler Radford, to be fired.Hooper has previously said Williams was armed with an AR-15 and displayed a weapon to Radford, who is white. The investigation into the shooting was turned over to the State Bureau of Investigation. When it is complete, the report will be turned over to the district attorney.When the protest was more than 24 hours old, the department closed off the front lobby area, directing people who had business at that station to meet officials at a different entrance.Hooper on Friday said she assigned an officer to work with the group and asked them to relocate their protest."Yesterday, we felt that giving people an opportunity to have some space and express themselves was what we wanted to do,” Hooper said before the arrests. "We respect their right to protest, and we allowed them to do that and stay there even though some of their behavior is not entirely lawful.”That unlawful behavior included posting a banner on the building and trespassing, she said, but officers had tried to work with protesters to come to a peaceful resolution."Today what we've done is we've assigned a liaison to work with their organizers. He's already met with them a couple of times. For their part, the protests have been very peaceful, they've been cooperative so far, so what we're trying to do now is provide opportunities for them to move to a lawful space to protest,” Hooper said.The eight arrested were taken to the Buncombe County magistrate's office.Before those arrests, the Rev. Amy Cantrell of the BeLoved House said the police liaison suggested the group move to the Vance Monument.That area, she said, was historically a slave auction block and members of the group were not comfortable moving there."(The police liaison) asked us to move and he's asked us to take this banner down,” Cantrell said. "He says it's hanging illegally and so one of the things we are talking to him about is our presence in this building and this banner."She added that she doesn't expect the group will remove the banner but will not impede the police from doing so.Delores Venable, a local activist, said the group is protesting not only Williams' death but also systemwide racial disparities."We have a black man who was killed here in Asheville, and not the first black man, Jai 'Jerry' Williams,” Venable said. "His family needs justice. We are tired of watching the blood of our black men run down the street, and we feel like the only way we will change the situation is to inflict change into the policies and the systems that keep black people and people of color oppressed.”Several supporters went to the Buncombe County magistrate's office to wait until those arrested were released, said supporter Holly Roach, co-director and lead organizer of an activist group called Transform Network. She said she was pleased with how the sit-in went."The past two days we've been able to bring awareness to the state of black Asheville," Roach said."I believe we demonstrated strong commitment on the part of white people to those of black Asheville," she said. "This day in particular we are uplifting black lives and affirming humanity of all lives.Asheville SURG set up a Go Fund Me page following the arrests called "Asheville Bail Fund." By 4 p.m. Friday the page had raised $195 out of a goal set at $2,500.CITIZEN TIMESPolice shooting Q&A: What we knowCITIZEN TIMESGroup holds rally, cell phones seized in officer-involved shootingCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://avlne.ws/29SsCVXFind JobsShare your feedback to help improve our site experience!
