Protesters also stopped at the Duval County Courthouse and the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office.From the steps of the courthouse, one of the organizers, James Evans Muhammad, New Black Panther Party minister of education, urged protesters to band together and stand firm."Let us leave here with unity. Unity in the community," he said.Their demands, he said, include an end to police brutality and racial attacks. They also demanded all local police wear body cameras and that minorities receive fair treatment by the Sheriff's Office and City Hall.Sheriff Mike Williams has not shown up at meetings they have asked he attend, Muhammad said. And the city has spent far too much on big projects, such as the courthouse, and not enough on the largely minority Northwest Quadrant,"Elected officials, there is something called 'recall,' a vote of no confidence," he said. "All power to the people."A sheriff's office spokesman could not be reached for comment.The signs held by protesters described pain, frustration and fear:"I can't keep calm I have a black son," "Stop killing black children," "Our lives begin and end the day we're silent."But the pain of police and their supporters was also evident. As Muhammad spoke, blue ribbons could be seen on the courthouse columns on either side of him and the courthouse flags were being flown at half-staff, both in memory of the five police officers slain during a recent protest in Dallas.Across the street from the courthouse, a white woman named Debbie, who declined to provide her last name, held a police memorial flag. She also had a homemade a sign both supporting police - "We Back the Blue" - and condemning the more strident members of the Black Lives Matter group - "BLM is a hate group."As a few black protesters approached her about the latter statement, she acknowledged that both the police and the Black Lives Matter group have bad apples. The sign was designed to "bring you over here to start a conversation," she told the protesters."Most police officers are trying to do a good job. They are hardworking people," said the woman, who said she had friends in the police ranks.A few of the protesters told her she had as much right to stand there with a sign as they did. Both sides said black and white officers are involved in civilian shootings of all races, but only the ones with racial overtones get the publicity. Conversation followed."It's a not a black and white thing," but a movement to end abusive police tactics, said Carleshia Smith, a black protester who talked to Debbie. Smith said she attended the march because "I believe in social change.""At the end of the day, if I get robbed, I'm going to call the police," she said. "But there are abusive situations."But other protesters were not ready - or willing - to have a conversation with Debbie. Later, another protester approached her with a bullhorn, shouting "blue lives murder."The group plans another gathering at 10 a.m. Monday at the Sheriff's Office. But about 100 of them were outside the Police Memorial Building about 6 p.m. Sunday, waiting for the three people who were arrested to be released from the neighboring jail.While they shared alarm over police shootings of young black men, people in the crowd, about 90 percent black, differed on how to respond.Speakers mentioned calls for an FBI investigations of each police-involved shooting; a change in law to increase public access to Jacksonville's response-to-resistance hearings; and asking the City Council to direct police funds to acquiring body cameras for officers instead of paying for overtime for increased police patrols.Some angry voices shouted references to war, while others answered that people should organize and be ready for a sustained effort to hold police accountable for their actions.When speaker Annette Fields declared "blue lives matter," she was met by a round of jeers. Fields, who said she has been involved in protests of the fatal police shooting in May of Vernell Bing, later told a reporter it's important for police to interact with black people as individuals, not just as crime suspects.People in the crowd said they had collected about $275 from demonstrators to help cover bail costs for the three people who were arrested. A demonstrator who wouldn't give his name told the crowd a bail bondsman had posted surety and the trio should be released soon. A woman who also declined to give her name said they had been charged with resisting police and two were charged with obstructing the road.The Jacksonville march was one of many held nationwide over the weekend by protesters disturbed by recent police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota. But the local group was particularly focused on the May 22 death of 22-year-old Vernell Bing Jr., who was shot and killed by a Jacksonville officer after he rammed a patrol car in a stolen vehicle during a chase.The site of Bing's shooting - Ninth and Liberty streets - is "ground zero," Muhammad said.The FBI, U.S. Attorney's Office and the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division are reviewing the case.Beth Reese Cravey: (904) 359-4109Steve Patterson: (904) 4263 Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you.
