It's a mission,” he repeatedly shouted.That mission?True racial equality, Utaegbulam says.Holding posters and chanting phrases such as "No Justice, No Peace "I Can't Breathe” and "Black Lives Matter,” the protest, which began on Cochituate Road near Target and Chick-fil A, was at least the fourth peaceful protest in the city in the past two weeks."I'm not going to get tired until justice is served,” the 47-year old said, struggling to say the words as his voice had nearly given out. "We're not going to stand down any longer. We can't be quiet.”The event was the fourth protest organized by Framingham High School graduates Kelvin Allan, Luma Viegas and Hannah Levine."We were so happy to see that there were so many people on our side fighting for the same matter,” said Viegas. "We want to fight against the injustices in this country.”Troy Johnson, 21, was attending Sunday's protest with his mother, Chantal.He said he found it very disappointing that the country is still dealing with such significant racial problems."The fact that it is 2020 and we're still dealing with issues that have been going on since before I was even a thought is really insane to me,” he said. "We really got to speak up and put it in everyone's mind.”Chantal Johnson said she was moved by the peaceful protests."I wasn't alive during the civil rights movement, but this is the one I'm witnessing,” she said. "I'm sorry that we have to do this again, but this whole thing is moving and it's especially moving because it's the young people leading the way.”She said a key thing that needs to change is that black men need to stop being seen as threats.Joanne Frye, a 55-year-old Framingham resident who owns a downtown hair salon, said she has experienced racism for much of her life.She went to an all-white school in Wayland, where she said she would often be called the n-word.She said the protests are an important step in bringing about more equality, but stressed more systemic changes need to occur.She pointed to the school system and what she described as its failures in teaching African American boys and girls about their heritage."Teach them about their history in school,” she said. "Teach them that they matter, and that they come from powerful people of substance, and not just from the bottom of a ship.”She also thinks society has to stop harassing black men.Protesters marched along Cochituate Road (Rte. 30) near Target and Chick-Fil A and Concord Street to the Memorial Building downtown and back again, according to Viegas.Allan said the group isn't planning another protest soon, but he is looking to start an annual event that promotes businesses that are owned by people of color. On that top of that, he wants to create scholarships for students of color who may not go to college, but may want to pursue a career in their chosen field.By creating those programs, people of color will have more opMportunities to succeed in the city and be a part of a more diverse and vibrant community, he said."We can take care, united,” he said.Ben Carrington, a Needham resident and recent Framingham State University graduate, said if people stay silent nothing will change."This is a problem that has been systemic for decades. It's time for our system to be corrected,” the 23-year old said. "It's time for change. If we don't keep our voices loud, we're going to be stuck in this oppressive state for the next century as we have before.”Cesareo Contreras writes about environmental issues and technology for the Daily News.
