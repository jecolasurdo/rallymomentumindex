Credit: Katy Griffith Black Lives Matter protestors marched through Peckham on Saturday, calling for an end to police brutality after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. The unarmed 46-year-old died after being held down by four policemen – one kneeling on his neck – as he pleaded: "I can't breathe”. The peaceful protest in Peckham was held in solidarity with campaigners in the USA, and to highlight discrimination in the UK. Demonstrators held a minute's silence for all those who had died at the hands of police. #BlackLivesMatter #peckham peaceful protest pic.twitter.com/LTiN300R74 — Queen Vaps (@TopeTops) May 30, 2020 Incredible #BlackLivesMatter protest in Peckham – explicitly anti-capitalist and almost entirely young people. Chants of "stop killing the mandem” and "the UK is not innocent” ringing out.
