They were only in front of the train for a brief time, he said, during which the train would have been stopped anyway.The protesters said in their statement that they stood in front of the train for four-and-a-half minutes — a span of time that symbolizes the four-and-a-half hours that the body of 18-year-old Michael Brown was in the street in Ferguson after being shot. Protests have swept the country since a grand jury in Ferguson and another grand jury in New York — convened to determine whether to charge white police officers who killed unarmed black men — declined to indict either man."We are taking direct action to challenge white supremacy and amplify the demands for an end to the war on black communities across the country,” one of the protest organizers, Mallory Hanora of Boston, said in the statement.Evan Allen can be reached at evan.allen@globe.com.
