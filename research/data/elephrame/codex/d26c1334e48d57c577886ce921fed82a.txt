Almost all of the protestors wore masks. The police presence was strong, but they did not intervene. Demonstrators, mostly young Hungarians, held up banners reading "Black Lives Matter" at the front of the demonstration. Other banners displayed messages such as "Police everywhere -- justice nowhere" or "No Justice -- No Peace." Floyd, 46, died on May 25 in Minneapolis after a white police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes while he was handcuffed facing down and repeatedly said he couldn't breathe. In his speech delivered in English and Hungarian, the well-known Hungarian reggae singer G Ras said: "We have come together to stand up against racism. Our enemies are not people of different political opinions, nor different political leaders, but human nature, the system in which we live, which we have built." "If we want to live in a better world, we need to radically change the way we live. On a global level, we must put an end to exploitation, racist hatred, and suffering," he added. His speech was greeted with huge applause, then young girls read texts about peace in English before an African-American activist spoke about standing up to injustice around the world. After the speeches and music, protestors knelt in silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds, the time it took for Floyd to lose consciousness as the police officer knelt on his neck. Floyd's death has sparked massive protests around the world against police brutality and racial discrimination in the United States. 1 2 Next 1 2 Next KEY WORDS: YOU MAY LIKE EXPLORE XINHUANET News China World Business Culture Edu Sports Sci Tech Health Entertainment Regions Asia & Pacific Americas Europe Africa Organizations North America Services Investment Doing Business Work in China Study in China Visit in China Live in China Emergency Weather More Photos Video In-depth Special Reports Corrections 010020070750000000000000011100001391217511
