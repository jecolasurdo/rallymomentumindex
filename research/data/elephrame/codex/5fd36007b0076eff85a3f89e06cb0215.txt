The throngs -- young and old, black and white -- took to the streets in major cities, including New York. In Washington, a crowd of thousands snaked up Pennsylvania Avenue to the Capitol. They appear to represent a burgeoning movement sparked by the decisions of grand juries in Missouri and New York not to indict white police officers in the deaths of two unarmed black men. Similar demonstrations were held Saturday in Boston and San Francisco.
