Earlier Sunday, protesters gathered to call for justice in the death of George Floyd, the Black man who died while in police custody in Minneapolis last week. Clashes with police, vandalism, and looting began Sunday night as many departed the State House rally. Warning: Numerous photos and videos below show violence. We say again, the time for protesting is over. The peaceful protest ended hours ago.
