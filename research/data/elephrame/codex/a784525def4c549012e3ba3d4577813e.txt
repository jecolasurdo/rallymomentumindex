Police said Rosser had a knife raised above her head and had taken steps toward officers before one officer fired a shot and another fired a Taser.The incident came at a time of rising concern for police actions in incidents involving unarmed black individuals across the nation."Since then, not much has really changed," Ahmad-Robinson said ahead of his speech. "We're here to have our voices heard at city hall to make sure that they don't forget because we haven't forgotten."The rally was planned ahead of the Ann Arbor City Council meeting, where members of the group spoke during public comment.Another group organizer, Austin McCoy, 35, said the group disagrees on the legal issues at hand in Washtenaw County Prosecutor Brian Mackie's decision that the shooting was justified, and said they share questions the American Civil Liberties Union has expressed in her death.Earlier this year, the ACLU recommended outside prosecutors review the case.Ahead of the council meeting, Ahmad-Robinson said one of the group's aims is to encourage police training focused on dealing with those with mental illness.Police announced intentions to undergo diversity training earlier this year.McCoy said the group continues to request that the officer who shot Rosser, Officer David Ried, be fired in order to send a message that police will be held accountable for officer-involved deaths and seeks to have an oversight board put in place."We hope the conversation around policing will resonate with the new chief," he said about the timing of the event.Officials were certainly aware of the group's presence as the lighted projection was initially shining on a building across the street and against city ordinance, according to officers at the scene.After group leaders has a conversation with Ann Arbor City Attorney Stephen K. Postema, the group received permission to shine the light on the side of the building directly in front of them.Ann Arbor to Ferguson also plans to hold a march and candlelight vigil in Aura Rosser's name on the anniversary of her death, starting at 6 p.m. at city hall.Darcie Moran covers cops and courts for MLive and The Ann Arbor News.
