Demonstrators gathered late Sunday afternoon at the home of Montgomery County Commissioner Joseph C. Gale, a Republican, who angered activists last week by calling Black Lives Matter "a radical left-wing hate group” that perpetrates "urban domestic terror." The protest that marched through Center City and ended at the steps of the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office ended peacefully, with the group dispersing around 5 p.m. Within minutes, the area was all but empty. The protesters, a few hundred strong, arrived at the door of the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office by late Sunday afternoon. Marchers cheered and chanted, holding signs like, "Free the Vulnerable, Free Them All” and "White People for Black Lives + Black Liberation.” Joe Biden — a longtime critic of former Philadelphia mayor Frank Rizzo — said a statue never should have been erected in his honor and on Sunday commended city leaders for removing the likeness. In Center City, protesters set off from LOVE Park on skateboards while dozens of doctors, nurses, and supporters rallied at the shuttered Hahnemann University Hospital. Hundreds also gathered at Eastern State Penitentiary and in Gloucester City. There have been 768 total arrests during a week of demonstrations, the city announced Sunday. Officials are also sharing coronavirus guidance for protesters, concerned "there may be an increased likelihood that participants may have been exposed to COVID-19.” For the first time in eight days the city did not impose a curfew Sunday.

The city ended its nightly curfew for the first time in eight days. Hundreds gathered in Malcom X Park in West Philadelphia, dancing as musicians sang, "We are our liberation.” And the controversial, three-story mural of former Mayor Frank Rizzo disappeared from South Philadelphia, covered by a fresh coat of gray paint. "I hope that people who were offended by it find some peace,” said Larry Fein, 52, who was shopping there. Gorgeous, sunny skies and comfortable temperatures presided over a lower-key set of demonstrations on Sunday, the day after thousands in Philadelphia joined a massive, peaceful protest to demand an end to racism and to declare that Black Lives Matter.

GLOUCESTER CITY — A small creek is all that separates this city under the Walt Whitman Bridge from Camden to the north. When he was a child growing up in Camden, though, Isaiah M. Conteh was told not to venture into Gloucester City, that whites there don't like blacks, and so he treated that creek and highway bridges that span it as an invisible wall. On Sunday afternoon, Conteh stood outside the Gloucester City library with about 400 other people for the culmination of a 90-minute Black Lives Matter protest and march that began at a park on the Delaware River. "I think it was lit,” Conteh, now a Gloucester City resident, said. "It shows this town is changing.” Vanessa Lamb, 21, and Tajee Almon, 26, both Gloucester City High School graduates, organized Sunday afternoon's protest after seeing so many others popping up in small, suburban towns in South Jersey. » READ MORE: 'This town is changing': Gloucester City holds a Black Lives Matter protest march unlikely there years ago — Jason Nark Share Shares Facebook Twitter 6:05 PM - June 7, 2020 6:05 PM - 06/7/20 6:05 PM - June 7, 2020 Facebook Twitter Protesters converge on Montco official's home for calling BLM a 'hate' group TOM GRALISH / Staff Photographer Protesters gather outside the Plymouth Meeting home of Montgomery County Commissioner Joe Gale on Sunday afternoon, calling for him to resign after he called Black Lives Matter a hate group. Demonstrators gathered late Sunday afternoon at the home of Montgomery County Commissioner Joseph C. Gale, a Republican, who angered activists last week by calling Black Lives Matter "a radical left-wing hate group” that perpetrates "urban domestic terror." More than 100 protesters gathered in the road in front of his home on a leafy suburban street in Plymouth Meeting, which had been closed to vehicles in anticipation of the demonstration, holding signs reading "How Many Weren't Filmed” and "Gale's Gotta Go.” Monica D'Antonio, a Montgomery County Community College English professor and Norristown Area School District board member who joined the protest, said that participants wanted Gale to resign for the comments he made after protests turned violent last weekend in Philadelphia. "His comments are unacceptable, he is unacceptable, and he doesn't represent the people of this county,” D'Antonio said. » READ MORE: Protesters converge on Montco official's home for calling BLM a 'hate' group — Jacob Adelman, Tom Gralish Share Shares Facebook Twitter 5:33 PM - June 7, 2020 5:33 PM - 06/7/20 5:33 PM - June 7, 2020 Facebook Twitter Center City march ends peacefully, protesters advocate for inmates MONICA HERNDON / Staff Photographer A protest at the Philadelphia Police Headquarters, which started at Eastern State Penitentiary, called on Governor Tom Wolf to release prisoners because of COVID on Sunday, June 7, 2020. The protest that marched through Center City and ended at the steps of the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office ended peacefully, with the group dispersing around 5 p.m. Within minutes, the area was all but empty. Shortly before, the protesters advocated for inmates who they said had tested positive for COVID-19 and not received adequate treatment. Commonwealth data reported that among all of the Department of Corrections' institutions, 300 inmates had tested positive for the coronavirus, 2,806 had tested negative, and nine had died. One hundred seventy inmates were awaiting their test results, and 30 inmates who tested positive were on parole. Inmates at SCI Huntingdon in Central Pennsylvania overwhelmingly reported the greatest number of inmates who tested positive — 169, making up 56% of the total number of positive cases in commonwealth correctional facilities. There was a total of 200 prison staff who tested positive for the virus, commonwealth figures showed. The most cases originated from SCI Phoenix in Collegeville, with 78 cases. SCI Huntingdon was next, with 54 cases.

African Americans in Philadelphia have been more than twice as likely as whites to be infected with the coronavirus. For Bogan and others at the rally, the shell of the 100-year-old Hahnemann hospital is symbolic of the problem because it served largely low-income or indigent patients, many of them minorities.

Saturday's marches featured few reports of problems in scenes that were more often festive than tense. Authorities were not quick to release crowd size estimates, but it was clear tens of thousands of people — and perhaps hundreds of thousands — turned out nationally. Collectively, it was perhaps the largest one-day mobilization since Floyd died May 25 and came as many cities lifted curfews imposed following initial spasms of arson, assaults and smash-and-grab raids on businesses. Authorities have softened restrictions as the number of arrests plummeted. Demonstrations also reached four other continents, ending in clashes in London and Marseille, France. In the U.S., Seattle police used flash bang devices and pepper spray to disperse protesters hurling rocks, bottles and what authorities said were "improvised explosives” that had injured officers, just a day after city leaders temporarily banned one kind of tear gas. — Associated Press Share Shares Facebook Twitter 10:54 AM - June 7, 2020 10:54 AM - 06/7/20 10:54 AM - June 7, 2020 Facebook Twitter City shares COVID-19 guidance for protesters; 768 total arrests announced CHARLES FOX / Staff Photographer Thousands turned out at the Philadelphia Museum of Art on June 6, 2020 in the city's largest demonstration yet against police brutality and racial injustice after the death of George Floyd.

Amid a national outcry over racial injustices and the killing of George Floyd, and a renewed local call to stop glorifying the legacy of a mayor known for his aggressive treatment of the city's black and gay communities, the mural was painted over early Sunday morning.
