It emphasized the campaign was not directed toward critics of the mall's policy banning protests.But instead, the hashtag invited another conversation, including members of the group Black Lives Matter Minneapolis, who used the opportunity to tweet out negative experiences they've had relating to the events that occurred during a protest at the mall in December.Nekima Levy-Pounds, who faces a list of charges related to the Dec. 20 protest, tweeted using the mall's hashtag."If #itsmymall, how come over 30 of my peeps were arrested for declaring #BlackLivesMatter in the Rotunda?" she tweeted. "#ItsMyMall? Well, the Bloomington City Attny clearly didn't get the memo. She charged me w/11 misdemeanor counts for being there on Dec. 20."Levy-Pounds said at first she thought the hashtag was a joke."But clearly it's not a joke, there is a lack of racial sensitivity on part of Mall of America's management and they have a lot of work to do to rebuild their reputation in the community," she said. "In fact, it's not our mall because of the way people were treated that day."Jen Kane, owner of Kane Consulting, a Minneapolis-based marketing and communications consulting firm, often advises large companies nationwide on how to strategically handle social media."So anytime you try to orchestrate the emotions of the masses, you run the risk of getting burned, and that is what happened to them," said Kane.She said a when a company is having a PR crisis, their entire brand identity is vulnerable. The Mall of America simultaneously created a positive sentiment while the negative wounds were still fresh."Their dirty laundry was already hanging out there, so to attempt to hang some clean stuff next to the dirty stuff and say, let's all look at the clean laundry. That is impossible because as a culture you are actually trained to look for the dirty laundry," Kane said.The Mall of America said while the backlash is "unfortunate" it will stick to its #itsmymall campaign. Kane said she would advise the Mall of America to discontinue the hashtag and wait to start a new conversation."The more companies try to say I get to control the conversation because I am bigger, the more the people get to say, no, we're bigger, and we get to talk about what we want to talk about â€” because this is a public forum," Kane said.Levy-Pounds also said in order to calm the social crisis, the mall must issue an apology or ask the Bloomington City Attorney to drop the charges. She also said, the mall should consider making the rotunda a public forum."In the midst of a boycott, of all types of concerns being raised about the way they treated Black Lives Matters protesters shows a major blind spot with (Mall of America) management and public relations team," said Levy-Pounds.The Mall of America issued a statement Wednesday:"Mall of America's new marketing campaign #ItsMyMall was intended to reflect supportive customer sentiment expressed since the Mall and its visitors were threatened last month in a terrorist propaganda video. It was not a response to critics of Mall of America's longstanding policy banning protests. While these two issues are obviously and entirely unrelated in every possible way, we acknowledge the confusion it created on social channels. Our goal was and is to support our tenants, customers and community in a meaningful and cooperative manner both on and offline."Michael McDowell, of Black Lives Matter, released a statement on behalf of the group:"We know the Mall of America wanted to use this hashtag (#itsmymall) as a way for people to share positive experiences at the mall, but we used this as an opportunity for people of color to share the negative experiences they've had."About Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Corrections Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Terms of Service Your California Privacy Rights/Privacy Policy Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info/Cookie PolicyContact Us Help Center My Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop Reprints & Permissions Advertise Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Pinterest YouTube Reddit Flipboard RSS10Best Grateful Reviewed Thanksgiving.com Job Network Moonlighting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett ClassifiedsThe City The Wall StorytellersÂ© 2020 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC.
