Hance Park just north of downtown.Children zipped by on scooters, older men walked with canes, and families pushed strollers and walked their dogs. Young people snapped selfies and posted them on social media, while organizations carried banners, posters and waved flags.The holiday is especially meaningful this year for Phoenix because city leaders decided to rename Broadway Road, from 48th Street to 67th Avenue, to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.MLK March coordinator Marquis Scott was inspired by the turnout, which included Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton and some council members."To have officials show up at this event where it's not about politics, to walk with us and hear from 'Joe and Jane' from the neighborhood, it makes a big impact," Scott said. "People who don't know one another walking next to each other and having conversations, it really breaks boundaries."The march was led by Phoenix members of the national Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity, of which the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. was a member.Alpha Phi Alpha member Dr. Earl Duval, 67, of Phoenix, marched proudly in the front with his group, and was happy to see young people participating."I'm happy to see there's lots of kids here, who are getting an education and doing things rather than joining gangs," he said.Clarence Johnson, 40, of Phoenix, brought his son Franklin, 11, to the event.

"It's important to remember the legacy of Dr. King and how he believed strongly in human rights. ... I wanted to share this experience with my son."Iman Totley, 14, and her friend Grace Berry, 20, both of Phoenix, participated in the march for the first time with their church group from Pilgrim Rest Baptist."It's been very powerful to see people from all over marching together," Totley said.Bee Spiderman, 26, of Phoenix, joined the march in the Roosevelt Arts District with her three friends. She has participated in the walk for four years."When I was growing up I didn't really care about history, I just rebelled and listened to punk music," she said. "Now I know it's important to be a part of it."The marchers spontaneously broke out into song along the way, performing "This Little Light of Mine" and "We Shall Overcome," often with a young boy leading on a megaphone.With a spate of cases involving unarmed black men and police in the media recently, some used the event to make a point by carrying posters about the controversies.Duval was happy to see a positive police presence during the march."I'm glad the march was peaceful and that the police are out here, talking to the people, because that is their job," Duval said.At the conclusion of the march, Scott congratulated the marchers for being a part of the important occasion. Groups gathered in front of the Phoenix Center for the Arts steps to snap photos, including members of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity and Mayor Stanton.Everyone gathered at Hance Park, where groups including Miss Black Arizona, the Arizona Coalition to End Domestic Violence and others handed out information.City officials and event organizers made short speeches.
