He was unjustly killed that morning,” said Mark Smith, who knew Bailey from Wheeler Mission and the Back on My Feet running clubAbout 20 people attended the pray-in Thursday at the City Market Plaza across from the City-County Building, where the panel heard the last day of testimony before deciding the fates of Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officers Carlton J. Howard and Michal P. Dinnsen.'I thought I was going to die':IMPD officer utters first public words in Bailey shooting'Silent' Greg:Here's why Mike Pence's brother, Greg Pence, should stop hiding, Tim Swarens writesAt the pray-in, Jetra Daniels read a statement from the Bailey family in which they called for justice."We are subject to the law of the land but we can't continually be oppressed by the law," the statement said. "Animals are treated better than black people."The Rev. Stephen Carlsen of Christ Church Cathedral on Monument Circle said Bailey worshiped with his congregation, attended the community breakfasts on Sundays and volunteered during the annual Strawberry Festival fundraiser."Now it is your turn," Carlsen said, addressing the seven merit board members who are expected to vote Thursday on whether to fire Howard and Dinnsen."Will you say that Aaron Bailey's life matters?" Carlsen asked. "Will you acknowledge that unarmed black men cannot be shot in the back in Indianapolis?"Around 1:45 a.m. June 29, Howard pulled over the 45-year-old Bailey for having a suspended license, according to a report issued by authorities. After being asked to step out of his car, Bailey fled and crashed his Cadillac into a tree on the north side.Bailey, officers said, ignored commands to show his hands and reached into the car's center console, where they thought he was reaching for a gun.The officers fired 11 times. There was no gun in Bailey's car.A special prosecutor found insufficient evidence to prove the officers were not justified in using deadly force and cleared them of criminal charges.Police Chief Bryan Roach recommended they be fired.The pray-in was organized by Faith in Indiana (formerly IndyCAN).Call Star reporter Vic Ryckaert at (317) 444-2701.
