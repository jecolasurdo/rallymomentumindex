The damages were later covered with white plastic.Rick White, of the university's communications department, issued a statement expressing disapproval of the vandalism and noting that the university is still working to contextualize the racial spaces on campus in accordance with its new curation and education initiatives."We understand that the issue of race and place is both emotional and, for many, painful," White said. "Carolina is working hard to ensure we have a thoughtful, respectful and inclusive dialogue on the issue. The extensive discussions with the Carolina community this past year by the Board of Trustees and University leadership, and the work we will be doing to contextualize the history of our campus is a big part of advancing those conversations. We welcome all points of view, but damaging or defacing statues is not the way to go about it."Joy McDowell, a senior at UNC, says she does not condone the vandalism but acknowledged that civil disobedience has a storied place in the push for civil rights."I think defacing public or private property is wrong because it is against the law. However, it does not take away from the fact that the statue's symbol is just as harmful and disrespectful to the minority students on campus. Anything representing the Confederacy is a direct representation of slavery and racism. Throughout history, civil leaders have chosen to break certain laws in order to protest against what they thought was wrong. This could be seen as no different."Similarly, alumnus Kevin Murach told WRAL.com that he did not agree with the vandalism but understood it."I certainly don't endorse people doing graffiti in any capacity because it's defacing public property, which is illegal," Murach said. "But I suppose I can appreciate that people are frustrated by a statue that's commemorating something related to the Confederacy."Alumna Ashley Winkfield says the move has been a long time coming."When the university fails to take meaningful action, especially in such a time where people are emotionally traumatized, people will take their own actions," she says. "All we as students have asked for is contextualization of the history of the statue, yet the university is dragging its feet. Slow action isn't good enough anymore."No suspects have been arrested in connection to the vandalization.About Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Corrections Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Terms of Service Your California Privacy Rights/Privacy Policy Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info/Cookie PolicyContact Us Help Center My Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop Reprints & Permissions Advertise Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Pinterest YouTube Reddit Flipboard RSS10Best Grateful Reviewed Thanksgiving.com Job Network Moonlighting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett ClassifiedsThe City The Wall StorytellersÂ© 2020 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC.
