"There is no doubt that racists are also hiding among all our local Balkan fascists. That's why Floyd is also 'ours',” said a statement announcing the protest.The United Coalition Against Racism in Poland organised a demonstration called 'No Justice No Peace – Poland' in front of the US Embassy in Warsaw on Saturday. Participants held up placards with slogans like "I stand with you BLM [Black Lives Matter]” and "How many more must die?”Several hundred young people joined a protest in Sofia the same day, not only against racism around the world but also in Bulgaria, where discrimination is often targeted at Roma people."Together we must fight for a brighter future for our children – with the hope of a peaceful, anti-racist and inclusive society built on mutual respect, justice, equality and love,” Mihail Mishev, a member of Roma Standing Conference told the protest in the Bulgarian capital.
