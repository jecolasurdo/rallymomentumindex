Protesters at march Wednesday demand defunding of El Paso Police DepartmentVeronica Martinez, El Paso Times Published 10:50 p.m. MT June 10, 2020 | Updated 4:37 p.m. MT June 11, 2020CLOSE El Paso for Black Lives protest demanding immediate defunding of the El Paso Police Department Wednesday, June 10, in downtown El Paso. El Paso TimesCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREEl Paso protesters have expanded their message of police reform beyond "Black Lives Matter” and "Justice for Floyd.”They now are demanding defunding of the El Paso Police Department.At the latest march Wednesday evening through Downtown, protesters carried signs that read: "Disarm the police" and "Defund and Demilitarize El Paso.”El Paso for Black Lives, one of the rally organizers, called in a flyer for the "complete and immediate defunding of the El Paso Police Department and reinvestment in our communities." The protest was promoted on social media by several local organizations.At San Jacinto Plaza, one of the locations where demonstrators gathered during the march, José Montoya observed the protest from a distance."I hope these protests, specifically here in El Paso, can cause some movement to get some of those funds out of the El Paso Police Department that can be used in the community,” Montoya said.He is advocating for improving public safety for minority residents, including transgender residents.It was not the first protest for the 42-year-old educator and community organizer, but it is the first time Montoya came out in support of Black Lives Matter and the demand for an overhaul of police policies.For Montoya, defunding the police means investing the funds into community programs to reduce crime and de-escalate tense situations between residents and police."I believe those funds can be allotted somewhere else that can help the community,” Montoya said.More: Demonstrators in El Paso show support for local law enforcementWant more news like this?Click here to subscribe to elpasotimes.com.Protesters initially gathered at Cleveland Square before marching to San Jacinto Plaza and then the El Paso County Courthouse, where National Guard troops stood behind orange barriers.A bongo drum could be heard among demonstrators, who moved down Santa Fe Street chanting, "No justice no peace, no racist police,” and, "This is what democracy looks like.” Soon after, they gathered at Mesa Street and Overland Avenue, carrying signs reading, "I can't breathe," and chanting, "These racist cops have got to go.”Close to 500 protesters participated in the rally, according to a crowd estimate by police.#defundeppd protesters begin to chant, "these racist cops have got to go” @elpasotimespic.twitter.com/Obi0AYZPKw— Briana Sanchez (@brie_san11) June 11, 2020The demonstration was held near a counterprotest, where supporters demonstrated against defunding the El Paso Police Department. The two groups exchanged chants and the names of people killed by police, but the protests were peaceful.A police drone and a Customs and Border Protection helicopter hovered above the protesters.Earlier, around 7 p.m., police vehicles blocked the Downtown exit off Interstate 10 East."Decisions to block intersections are done to protect residents according to what officers consider to be needed," Police Department spokesperson Adrian Cisneros said.Cisneros did not confirm whether the closure of the I-10 off-ramp onto Santa Fe Street was due to the protests. At San Jacinto Plaza, black residents stood on a wooden platform, took a megaphone and aired their grievances about the police and racism to the crowd surrounding the fountain. "I get judged by the color of my skin, in the way the police treat me, the way schools treat me, the way hospitals treat me, even in the way people look at me," Katie Titan said.FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInEl Paso for Black Lives protest demanding immediate defunding of EPPD FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

"It's really important for me, but I'm here more to provide water and first aid in case anything gets out of hand.”The 21-year-old community college student said she supports shifting funding from the Police Department."I think our money needs to go to more important things like education and so many other things that need to be supported,” Rhodes said. "And EPPD is not one of them.”For the 2020 fiscal year, the El Paso Police Department had a budget of $157.6 million, of which $139.7 million goes toward salaries and employee benefits, according to the 2020 city budget.The Police Department had an increase of 55 officers from the 2019 fiscal year.As of May 30, there were 1,179 uniformed officers and 241 civilian employees, the El Paso Police Department said.In 2015, the city adopted a 10-year plan to increase the number of officers by 300 over the next decade.Marty Hunt stood at the corner of Santa Fe Street and Franklin Avenue, waiting for the traffic light to change so he could walk to Cleveland Square to support the Black Lives Matter movement.Hunt has lived in El Paso since 1974 but grew up around the country as an "Army brat,” he said. In 1971, when he lived in Pennsylvania, a black friend was shot by a police officer in what Hunt believes was a case of racial profiling.For Hunt, policing practices have improved, but he said he joined the protest because more needs to be done to eliminate racism and to evaluate the effectiveness of police spending."I believe (the El Paso Police Department) budget is very high and I think it should be cut,” Hunt said. "I think the funds should be used to improve the city's streets, in mental health and helping the homeless population. Maybe that will do us best.”Police officials did not respond to a phone call asking for comment on the demand to defund the department.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://www.elpasotimes.com/story/news/2020/06/10/el-paso-black-lives-matter-protestors-demand-defunding-police/5330881002/Find JobsShare your feedback to help improve our site experience!
