Floyd called out for his mother. He gasped the words: "I can't breathe." He was accused of trying to buy a pack of cigarettes with a counterfeit $20 bill.The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel is covering local demonstrations and fallout and will update this story throughout the day. See Saturday's full coverage here. People with disabilities led hundreds in a more accessible protest through Milwaukee. On what would have been Pridefest weekend in Milwaukee, a massive crowd gathered for a Pride march for Black Lives Matter. And Bucks forward Sterling Brown, whose civil rights lawsuit with Milwaukee is ongoing, was joined by several thousands as he led his team's march through the city.Some background:Milwaukee has a long and proud history of civil rights activism against police brutality and racial inequity. In 1967, demonstrators took to the streets for 200 consecutive days, marching until Milwaukee passed one of the strongest fair housing laws in the U.S. Yet, it remains one of the country's most segregated metro areas.For more:How far has Milwaukee come since the 1967 fair housing marches?Are the protests peaceful? What about unrest?What legacy will the marchers leave?What do community leaders have to say about the roots of racism against black people?A Twitter List by journalsentinel11:15 p.m.: 'Defund Police' painted on Madison street leading to CapitolProtesters brought yellow paint to downtown Madison on Monday night, painting a street that leads to the Wisconsin State Capitol with a message of "DEFUND POLICE.”The message spanned an entire city block and each letter took up the width of the four-lane street, which passes by the administration building of the city of Madison and Dane County.It was painted during a rally — small for Madison standards — that took place nearby to protest the suffocation death of George Floyd. Monday was the 10th day of protests in the state's capital, following a demonstration that drew 10,000 people on Sunday.Protesters paint "DEFUND POLICE" on a block of Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. in downtown Madison Monday night. (Photo: Molly Beck)The idea of significantly reducing or even eliminating funding for police departments has rapidly shifted in recent days from an unlikely idea pushed by activists to real action being considered by Democratic officials — including the Minneapolis city council and the Los Angeles mayor — in the wake of Floyd's death.Protesters' message to defund police departments was written toward the state Capitol – a building where the message likely won't get much traction.GOP lawmakers who control the Legislature have rebuffed calls to slash funding for police, and Democratic Gov. Tony Evers last week said the idea of greatly cutting or eliminating funding for police goes too far.It's unclear what kind of support the idea has among Madison leaders, however.Freedom Inc., a group that has led most protests in Madison over Floyd's death, is seeking to abolish police. Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway has said she wants to work with groups that can provide an alternative to police, and is seeking to make changes to department policy and oversight, but has not weighed in on the idea of defunding the city's department.—Molly Beck6:15 p.m. Protest march stops at Shorewood home of Stephanie RapkinOn Monday at 2:30 pm, about 100 people gathered for a march through Shorewood, organized by Community Task Force MKE.Vaun Mayes, the founder and head of Community Task Force MKE, had originally set out to lead a march to historic sites of racist violence and police brutality. But after a video began circulating of a white attorney spitting on a black high school student at a protest, Mayes changed the route to wind through Shorewood. He said he wanted to draw attention to racism in the community.The protest walked through Shorewood and eventually stopped in front of the house of Stephanie Rapkin, the attorney who has been charged with disorderly conduct after spitting on high school student Eric Lukas.Those in cars honked their horns, and the marchers chanted "Black Lives Matter” before hunkering down for food, all on the street, sidewalks and grass in front of Rapkin's house, according to Urban Milwaukee reporter Graham Kilmer. Soon, a truck arrived on the scene with chicken and fries for the protesters.- Genevieve Redsten4:05 p.m.: Milwaukee man charged with aiming laser pointer at aircraftA 38-year-old Milwaukee man was charged with aiming a laser pointer at an FBI surveillance plane and a National Guard helicopter.Jeremiah Belen faces a single federal count of aiming a laser pointer at an aircraft.On June 1, 3 and 4, the pilot of a Wisconsin National Guard Blackhawk helicopter flying over protests reported being targeted with a laser. One night it was coming from a demonstration near Milwaukee Police Department District 5, very close to a house near 1st and Chambers."Whenever (the helicopter pilot) was hit with the laser in these recent evenings, (he) was forced to look away and maneuver the aircraft into a new position," according to the criminal complaint.FBI agents in a plane flying over protests on May 31 detected green dots on the wings and cockpit, coming from the vicinity of North Ave. and N. 14th Street. On the evening of June 3, the agents noticed the laser again, and this time were able to trace it to the front porch of a house in the 3000 block of N. 1st St. On Sunday the pilot of the FBI plane reported seeing the laser and agents on the ground saw Belen standing on his porch in the 3000 block of N. 1st St. pointing an object into the sky. - Bruce Vielmetti3:35 p.m.: 24-year-old leads protest in Sherman Park, launches petitionAshley Smith, 24, led a protest at Sherman Park on June 8, 2020. (Photo: Patricia McKnight)Ashley Smith, 24, is one of the key organizers, among other young, black women, in today's protest at Sherman Park. She's lived in Milwaukee her whole life but went to high school in Franklin and experienced what it it was like to be a minority in a predominantly white institution. "The racism wasn't blatant until it was,” said Smith. " But the microaggressions was just constant. It just didn't seem genuine when it came down to the way my white classmates and teachers would try to interact with me or connect with me." She's here today to bring the community together through art and to make sure other black women have the opportunity and resources to thrive. Smith is a singer and the other women of color who organized the protests, all have a great appreciation for the arts. They brought cardboard, spray paint, stencils and other donated supplies to create color signs. "It brings us together by actually creating something that turns our feelings and our passions into a piece of work,” said Smith. She said the colorful signs with draw attention to them and hopefully get people to sign their petition.Their petition is aimed at Mayor Tom Barrett and the Milwaukee Common Council to bring viable change in Milwaukee, asking for those who sign to "divest from the Milwaukee police department." "We want to stress the petition we've got going on on change.org to divest a minimum of 10% of MPD's budget and reinvest that money within our community,” said Smith. The black women who organized the protest want the money to go into schools and positive community outlets. "We want it to go into education, after school programs and other black-owned businesses so we can actually see the change in our community,” said Smith.— Patricia McKnight1:21 p.m.: '60 Minutes' revisits Milwaukee's Daniel Bell caseA trove of "60 Minutes" reports on race and America, posted online this weekend, includes a 1980 story on the case of Daniel Bell, a 22-year-old African American who was killed by a Milwaukee police officer in 1958. The officer then led a cover-up of the killing. Anchored by "60 Minutes' " Morley Safer, "The Kid, the Cop and the Knife" retells the case chiefly through the officer's partner at the time, Louis Krause, who admitted in 1979 that he had given false testimony about what happened the night of Bell's death. Krause and officer Thomas Grady pulled over Bell because his car had a broken tail light. Bell ran off, but the officers caught up with him after four blocks. Grady shot Bell, and then planted a knife in his right hand, claiming it was self-defense. (Bell was left-handed.) Daniel Bell was killed by a Milwaukee police officer in 1958. Twenty-one years later, the officer's partner revealed that a knife had been planted on Bell to make the killing look like self-defense.In the "60 Minutes" report, Krause tells Safer that he was told to agree with Grady's version of the story. An all-white inquest jury later determined it was self-defense. The story includes an audio clip of a 1979 conversation between Krause and Grady, in which the latter says he was trained by the Milwaukee police department to plant a weapon on a victim "to protect yourself." News of the cover-up sparked protests in Milwaukee at the time (the protests aren't mentioned in the "60 Minutes" report). — Chris Foran12:40 p.m.: Estimated 10,000 attend Sunday protest in MadisonTen thousand gathered at the state Capitol Sunday evening for the ninth day of protests over the death of George Floyd.The African-American Council of Churches led the event, drawing one of the largest crowds since the first night of protests last Saturday, May 30. For many, it was their first time attending Madison's most recent rallies against police brutality, undoubtedly encouraged by a weekend of good weather and little police altercation at most of the week's events. Leaders from various religious groups — such as Mt. Zion Baptist Church, the Life Center, Beth Israel Center and Lighthouse Church — spoke, sang and cheered to the crowd, which spanned from the Capitol Square all the way to Library Mall.Sunday's protest came just as Madison organizations wrapped up their week of action Saturday night, "In Defense of Black Life,” to put an end to "racist police terror.” But many protesters didn't plan to stop gathering and demonstrating. "This is not the end of a weeklong movement — this is the beginning of a revolution,” a protester said Saturday. "I'm going to make sure my children don't have to fight this again.”— Allison Garfield FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInMadison business boarded up ahead of George Floyd protests became canva...

"Shame on them. That's an easy narrative."The Common Council members – Ashanti Hamilton, Cavalier Johnson, Nik Kovac, Robert Bauman, Nikiya Dodd, Milele Coggs, Khalif Rainey, JoCasta Zamarripa, Chantia Lewis, Michael Murphy, José Pérez, Marina Dimitrijevic, and Russell Stamper II – wrote that Floyd's death was the immediate cause of the protests but not the only cause.They referenced the names of people who had died or suffered significant injuries at the hands of Milwaukee police."And after a week of protests in our city, we are not just protesting the past: we are protesting the present and your police department's response to these protests,” they wrote.They also urged Morales to listen to protesters' demands in response to his statement that law enforcement throughout the nation was being crucified.They also referenced the names of Milwaukee police officers who have died."The current historical moment — in Milwaukee and throughout the nation — is not a competition to claim the right to religious analogies,” they wrote. "It is a demand for justice, something for which too many have already died. It is a demand for significant and immediate structural reform of all police departments — including ours — to make sure George Floyd's name is the last.”— Alison DirrSUNDAY, JUNE 78:30 p.m.: Accessible protest completes loop back to Veterans ParkMarchers were gathered for more pizza and speeches in Veterans Park, completing a loop for those from the accessible protest that began in the park earlier today, according to BizTimes Milwaukee reporter Maredithe Meyer.

"Welcome to being black.”Nitty announced to cheers that the Minneapolis City Council plans to disband the city's police department. Nitty said "if it can happen in Minnesota” it could happen in Milwaukee."I think it's time to disband the Milwaukee Police Department,” Nitty said. - Dana Brandt5:26 p.m.: 'I'm tired of crying at home': Pride march for Black Lives Matter draws large crowdBuy PhotoAnna Sellers, also know as 'Lady London', let's her voice be heard when the more than 1,000 stopped at 1st and National street while participating in the March with PRIDE for #BLACKLIVESMATTER that originated at Henry W.

(Photo: Angela Peterson / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)A large crowd gathered at Henry Maier Festival Park Sunday afternoon for a Pride march for Black Lives Matter.Prince's "Purple Rain” was among the music played before speakers climbed on top of a minivan to address the crowd of what appeared to be well over 1,000 people."Me being part of the LGBT community and also being an individual of the black culture, I felt that we needed to show our voice as a community supporting the Black Lives Matter movement,” event organizer Broderick Pearson, who is also known as Montell Infiniti Ross, told the Journal Sentinel.A lot of issues facing the Black Lives Matter movement are also facing the LGBTQ+ community, Pearson said."We are discriminated upon, we have judgment placed upon us, there's a lot of social inequities that are faced on both ends of the spectrum, whether you're part of the black culture or part of the LGBT culture,” Pearson said.Pearson would like to see funding that currently goes to police in Milwaukee redirected to communities that are discriminated against.Pearson addressed the crowd from atop speakers that were secured to the roof of the minivan, helping others up onto the platform when it was their turn to speak.Among them was Chris Walton, chairman of the Democratic Party of Milwaukee County who is running for State Assembly District 17.He urged those attending to support the elected officials who also came to the event.Marchers were reminded before they set out that the protest would be peaceful.Buy PhotoA crowd of over 1,000 resume marching after stopping at South 1st Street and East National Avenue during the March with Pride event.

Nitty passed the microphone to a young girl who guided the crowd in call-and-response of "No justice, no peace,” "Black Lives Matter,” and "I can't breathe, can you breathe?”Around 4:45 p.m., the unified marchers set out westward on East Michigan Street with protesters from the accessible march leading the way, some using wheelchairs, according to the livestream. Protesters approached Nitty and introduced themselves as they walked, sharing how many days they've marched with him, discussing his activism and occasionally posing for pictures.—Dana Brandt3:24 p.m.: Accessible march on the move in MilwaukeeA protest intended to be more accessible for people of all abilities is starting to move from Veterans Park in Milwaukee.The group took a flat route, had sign language interpreters and offered rest stops with medics and supplies. The march took over all lanes of Lincoln Memorial Drive as it headed south. "People with disabilities weren't really included in the marches,” said one of the organizers, Harvey Ross.

Brown declined media interviews but talked with a Bucks staffer on camera before leaving the group of protesters at Veterans Park. "For these white people and everybody that's not black to walk up the street and say black lives matter— if they really mean it then something's gonna come out of this,” Brown said. Mayor Tom Barrett was at Fiserv Forum but did not speak.Milwaukee Police Chief Alfonso Morales and other officers joined the march, but walked away from the crowd after people asked why Morales was there and said they didn't want him to be.The crowd marched to Veterans Park, where another protest — intended to be more accessible for people with disabilities — was set to begin.—Rory Linnane1:44 p.m.: Woman taken into custody for spitting on a minor after protesters asked her to move car, police sayA 64-year-old Shorewood woman was taken into police custody at 10:12 p.m. Saturday after spitting on a juvenile male during an altercation that happened earlier Saturday in the 4000 block of North Oakland Avenue, Shorewood police said.
