"The approval in the city budget of personal body cameras is nothing but a shallow aid to justice."Aziz called for other changes to the department following Rosser's death."Other policy changes we want regards training, sensitivity training and changing the amount of force (used)," she said. "Body cameras themselves are not a change that is going to stop people from dying."Aura RosserSince the shooting, Ann Arbor police have begun equipping officers with body cameras and they have also gone through diversity training. The city's Human Rights Commission last week issued a 42-page report titled "Civilian Police Review: Recommendations for Strengthening Police-Community Relations in Ann Arbor," which details many more recommendations.Rosser was fatally shot one year ago when police officers were called to 2083 Winewood Avenue to investigate a domestic disturbance. When they arrived, reports indicate Rosser came toward the officers with a knife.Among Monday's crowd of 75-100 people was recent University of Michigan graduate Sumana Palle."There was no justice done for Aura Rosser," she said. "I'm really not happy because a lot of the changes were a response to shut down the criticism without actually substantiating reform."Ann Arbor police officer David Ried was the one who fired the fatal shot, while officer Mark Raab fired his Taser at her.After an investigation, Washtenaw County prosecutors said the shooting was justified.The shooting sparked outrage from groups of protesters and the American Civil Liberties Union about police brutality and the use of lethal force.There were no issues with backlash during the march, as most cars stopped to let the protesters walk in the street.Geoff Preston covers general assignment news for MLive and The Ann Arbor News.
