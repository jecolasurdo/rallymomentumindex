Tamar Wilson of the Socialist Alternative speaks to the group from the back of a pickup truck near 3rd and Race Streets, the vicinity of the mayor's home. Hundreds of protesters stood outside Mayor Jim Kenney's home on Saturday evening, calling for him to cut more funding from the police department budget. After marching from North Broad Street to Old City, the protest ended at 3rd and Race Streets, where Kenney lives in an apartment building. The Black Lives Matter movement, one protester said through a megaphone, as others cheered, is "not just about police brutality” but about an entire "guilty system." — Oona Goodin-Smith, Juliana Reyes Share Shares Facebook Twitter 5:27 PM - June 13, 2020 5:27 PM - 06/13/20 5:27 PM - June 13, 2020 Facebook Twitter 'Defund the police' demonstrators march through Center City After gathering in North Broad Street, hundreds of protesters marched south Saturday, passing City Hall and continuing onto Market Street. While the protest was organized to call for defunding the police, demonstrators also held signs calling for more school funding, protection for transgender people, and other causes. Groups of marchers held banners representing unions and immigrants' rights groups. They chanted sayings such as "no justice, no peace” as they marched. They also chanted the name of Dominique Fells, a black transgender woman whose dismembered body was pulled from the Schuylkill River this week. As the group passed City Hall, police officers stood behind barricades in front of the Municipal Services Building, where a statue of former Mayor and Police Commissioner Frank Rizzo was removed last week. When the demonstrators reached Old City, they marched past people enjoying the first weekend of outdoor dining at restaurants since the COVID-19 shutdown.

The goal, said Thomas Easterday, 50: "Protecting the statue from these rioters who want to take it down.” » READ MORE: Christopher Columbus statue in Camden taken down, but pieces being held in protest by residents He and others indicated their presence was as much to ward off any vandals as to send a message to Mayor Jim Kenney that removing the statue in the middle of the night, as he did the statue of former Mayor Frank Rizzo, would not be permitted. Calls to remove statues of Columbus in Philadelphia and other cities are not yet, but have been renewed amid protests over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Camden removed a statue on Thursday, and Wilmington officials announced Friday they would remove a Columbus statue. Those present, South Philadelphia residents or natives, said they considered Columbus an emblem of their heritage, and any attempt to erase him a "hate crime." ”It would be over my dead body before they got to this statue," said Anthony Ruggiero, 41, wearing an Italia jersey. "This is a part of history.” Draped in an Italian flag, Joseph Pungitore, 38, said he lives nearby and has been frequently checking on the statue in light of the push to remove monuments connected to histories of oppression. He planned to stick around until he has to go to work Monday if necessary. His son stood nearby, leaning on a baseball bat, but Pungitore clarified: "I'm standing for peace.” » READ MORE: South Philly residents surround Columbus statue as demonstrations unfold across the city — Samantha Melamed Share Shares Facebook Twitter 3:49 PM - June 13, 2020 3:49 PM - 06/13/20 3:49 PM - June 13, 2020 Facebook Twitter 'Defund the police' protest draws hundreds to future Philly police headquarters ELIZABETH ROBERTSON / Staff Photographer Protesters gather for a march calling to defund the police at Broad and Callowhill Streets in Philadelphia on Saturday. Hundreds of protesters filled three blocks of North Broad Street on Saturday afternoon for a rally calling for defunding the city's Police Department. The group gathered in front of the future Philadelphia police headquarters at 400 N. Broad St., The Inquirer's former building. Demonstrators are calling for "removing millions from the police budget,” according to the event's Facebook page. Mayor Jim Kenney had proposed a $19 million increase to the police department budget in the coming fiscal year, while planning cuts to other city departments and services due to the financial impact of COVID-19. Kenney said this week that he would eliminate the planned increase to the Police Department budget in response to demands from protesters and City Council, which must approve a budget this month for the fiscal year that starts July 1. » READ MORE: After days of protests against police brutality, Mayor Jim Kenney pledges police reforms "Mayor Kenney ran on a platform of ending stop and frisk and police brutality. Instead he increased the police budget by $120 million,” Liz Gardiner, a librarian, told the crowd gathered Saturday.

Roger Ford, who was 9 years old when police bombed his block, said he has lived with the trauma for decades. Lauren Schneiderman Hundreds of protesters gathered on Saturday, June 13, at the site of the MOVE bombing in Cobbs Creek to protest police brutality "This is necessary,” he said of the protests. "Anyone who lives in this melting pot of a country and finds these actions appalling needs to stand up and speak out.” Speakers said that apologies for the MOVE bombing without action are meaningless; former Mayor W. Wilson Goode Sr. recently called for an official city apology. "The system is broken from end to end," said Mike Africa Jr., whose parents Mike and Debbie Africa spent 40 years in prison after they were among nine MOVE members convicted in the death of a police officer after a 1978 standoff.
