"I think that is testament to why we had to create an intervention into Pride in the first place.”The hate mail, which is "100 per cent” made up of anti-black racism, denounces members of Black Lives Toronto who have identified as queer and trans, said Khan."It's 'You could never be a part of our community, you savage monkey,' that kind of thing,” she said. "The reality is that gender and sexual diversity doesn't negate the reality of racism and white privilege...In their minds my blackness made it so that I couldn't possibly be a part of their community.”The group is now focused on ensuring Pride Toronto follows through with the list of demands that was signed at the stalled parade."Whether or not our demands are seen through — and they will be seen through — the success that comes out of creating the type of dialogue that we've seen is monumental,” said Khan."This type of push back, this type of backlash, it means that we've struck a nerve...It shouldn't have taken 30 plus years for Pride to really consider what would make black communities and racialized communities feel safer in Pride.”Sunday's sit-in was just the latest in a series of actions taken by the group that has frequently accused Toronto police of racial profiling and violence against the black community.Last summer, a rally shut down a portion of a busy expressway as the group called for justice in the police shooting deaths of two black men.This March, members of the group camped out in front of Toronto police headquarters for two weeks, demanding an overhaul of Ontario's police watchdog and the release of the name of an officer who fatally shot a man last summer. The group has also been a vocal critic of the controversial practice of police carding, street checks which it said unfairly targeted young black, brown and indigenous people.The group's demand to ban police floats and booths from the Pride Parade and Pride community spaces appears to have emerged as its most contentious call since Sunday, but Khan said Black Lives Matter Toronto isn't seeking a meeting with police over the matter."We're not closed off to discussion and negotiation, but we do not at this point trust commitments that the police make to us directly,” Khan explained. "We're going to move forward focusing on what the community wants from us.”Get more of what matters in your inboxStart your morning with everything you need to know, and nothing you don't.

"That type of police presence within the parade itself is inherently problematic and creates very exclusive space for police officers and excludes marginalized communities from participating in the parade.”Pride Toronto said it hopes to gather feedback on this year's Pride events at a public town hall scheduled for August.SHARE:Report an errorJournalistic StandardsAbout The StarMore from The Star & PartnersMore NewsTop StoriesLOCAL GUIDEMORE BUSINESSVIEW ADSCopyright owned or licensed by Toronto Star Newspapers Limited.
