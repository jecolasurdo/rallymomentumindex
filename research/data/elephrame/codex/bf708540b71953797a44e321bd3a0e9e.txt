Black Lives Matter protesters turned away at Broome County jailAshley Biviano, Binghamton Press & Sun-Bulletin Published 6:47 p.m. ET June 4, 2020 | Updated 12:29 p.m. ET June 5, 2020CLOSE A few hundred protesters gathered at Cheri A. Lindsey Memorial Park in Binghamton on June 2, 2020 to speak out against racial injustice. The crowd later moved the event from the park to the Binghamton Police Station in Downtown Binghamton. WochitCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREAbout 350 protesters bringing their message to the Broome County jail were stopped by a dozen officers blocking the road to the facility late Thursday, part of a third night of peaceful protests in the Binghamton area against racial injustice. After disbanding, some of the protesters headed downtown, where some 75 of them were shouting chants on Court Street as Binghamton police stood nearby late into the night.The protests are part of a nationwide movement spurred by the May 25 death of black man George Floyd at the hands of a white Minneapolis police officer. Locally, protesters marched from Binghamton High School to Recreation Park on Sunday and from Cheri A. Lindsey Park to Binghamton Police headquarters Tuesday. Thursday night's protest location signaled controversy over the jail, which has seen at least nine inmates die in custody since 2011 and where alleged treatment of inmates has drawn criticism. The protest opened with a series of speakers starting at about 6 p.m. in a parking lot at the intersection of Front and Lt. Vanwinkle Drive in the Town of Dickinson, just up the road from the jail.

(Photo: Kate Collins / Binghamton Press & Sun-Bulletin)A cardboard display board showed charts, photos and information under the header "JUST the Facts: Mass Incarceration Thrives in Broome County."About 350 people gathered around a red tent, where speakers grabbed a microphone and took turns voicing their thoughts on racial injustice. Others spoke about the Broome County jail.Shanel Boyce said, "We live in a country that says everyone has access to this American dream, but somehow that American dream has always left out black people. So, as you buy into this American dream, you are by default denying your black brothers and sisters their humanity, dignity and right to freedom." "That jail up there is a house of horror," said one speaker, who identified himself only as Andy and said he is a member of Justice and Unity for the Southern Tier (JUST).After Andy asked attendees to raise their hand if they knew someone who had been incarcerated, a majority of the demonstrators raised their hands. "What does it mean for our society, when almost all of you know someone personally that's had someone locked up?" he said. "What does that mean? What does that mean? They don't have any other way to impose what they want on us." So this just happened. Protesters identified him as a @BroomeSheriff corrections officer #BlackLivesMatter#DefundThePolice#Binghamtonpic.twitter.com/VRerRCTbKx— Kate Collins📸 (@kcollins213) June 4, 2020Midway through the protest, a white man drove by in a navy Ford F-150 and yelled, "White lives matter!" In response, a handful of protesters ran into the road as the rest stayed in the parking lot, chanting at the driver."Shut it down," they said, and the pickup truck drove away.Area activist Salka Valerio said she would gather a list of demands from the community so they could be brought to area officials."We can't just be out here screaming, yelling and fighting for no reason," she said. "We need systematic change. And right now, people are paying attention.""I want you to see my color. And say my color is beautiful. My color is strong. My color is powerful. We all see color. I see you. I recognize you. Period." pic.twitter.com/z7hr9bgwPn— Ashley Biviano (@ashley_biviano) June 4, 2020Boyce spoke about her 11-year-old daughter, and how tired she is of having to teach her about white supremacy. She said she's tired of having to tell her daughter she's beautiful and she won't be defined merely by the color of her skin."I'm tired of telling her white people don't have all the answers even though they think they do, and I'm tired of having to explain to her why I keep having to put my life on the line," Boyce said. "Some of ya'll will never know what it's like to sit there and have to explain to your 11-year-old daughter that mommy might not come home ever again."Buy PhotoBlack Lives Matter protest at the Broome County Jail, June 4, 2020.

But when they arrived, they were met by a dozen or so officers blocking Lt. Vanwinkle Drive with their bodies and patrol cars.

Many began to leave, and organizers announced they would gather again at 4 p.m. Sunday at Rec Park. One organizer told demonstrators to go home and stop blocking traffic.Buy PhotoLaw enforcement during the Black Lives Matter protest at the Broome County Jail, June 4, 2020.

Dozens did, gathering at the corner of Washington and Court streets.They continued to chant at police, who blocked off the remainder of Court Street and the new outdoor dining area outside of the Colonial, where several restaurant patrons were eating.Buy PhotoBlack Lives Matter protest at the Broome County Jail, June 4, 2020. (Photo: Kate Collins / Binghamton Press & Sun-Bulletin)Around 10:40 p.m., organizer Talon Thomas addressed law enforcement officers directly, asking them if they remembered art class, and what happens when all of the colors are mixed together. It was a long time ago, the officer responded."Black, you put all the colors together and you get black. Right or wrong?" Thomas said. "So when we say black lives matter, we're still saying all lives matter, but all lives don't matter until black lives matter." At this point, the officers appeared to walk back toward The Colonial and not engage in further dialogue. Around 11 p.m., Thomas addressed the crowd to say it has been the third successful night of protesting.Faith and footwork: Binghamton native says George Floyd march should serve as U.S. exampleProtests in Binghamton: Binghamton protesters demand racial justice during afternoon marches"I know a lot of you are tired, so I want everyone to go home, get some rest and show up at Rec Park Sunday," he said.

He died at the age of 46 on May 25, 2020, after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin pressed his knee into the back of Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds. George Floyd live updates: Memorial service for Floyd, hearing for officers starting soonFloyd was born in Fayetteville, N.C., but grew up in Houston where most of his family still lives. Floyd was a standout high school athlete who played basketball for South Florida State College, his youngest brother Rodney Floyd said.Martin Luther King III takes a moment by George Floyd's casket Thursday, June 4, 2020, before a memorial service for George Floyd in Minneapolis. (Photo: Bebeto Matthews, AP)According to a county medical examiner, the pressure from Chauvin's knee led to Floyd's death. Chauvin is facing a murder charge. Three other officers have now been charged with aiding and abetting. Floyd was a father of two. He called out for his mother — who died about two years ago — as Chauvin held his knee against his neck. A memorial service for Floyd was held Thursday afternoon. Protesting Broome County jail not newIn March, the Broome County Sheriff's Office said nine inmates have died while in custody since 2011, though local advocacy groups have cited 11 deaths during that period — that number includes two inmates who died after getting out of jail.Inmate deaths: Broome County jail deaths put spotlight on inmate medical careEach of the nine fatalities was investigated by the New York State Commission of Corrections, which oversees jails statewide.Advocacy groups in Broome County, including Justice and Unity for the Southern Tier (JUST), have raised concerns and organized protests in recent years to argue changes are needed in how the jail approaches the quality of its medical treatment for inmates.Last year during the Columbus Day parade, a protest was organized by the Binghamton-area activist group Progressive Leaders of Tomorrow (PLOT), which issued a statement that their goal was to demonstrate against incarceration conditions at the Broome County jail. Protesting jail conditions: Protesters arrested at Binghamton Columbus Day parade: Here's what we knowOne participant of last year's protest wore a shirt that stated, "Broome County Jail Is Killing."An estimated 25 protesters gathered and at one point, some protesters stood blocking the parade route. Four were charged with disorderly conduct. Another protest was held at the jail last August. "Black residents in Broome County are currently incarcerated at a rate more than ten times that of their white counterparts," read the event's description.FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInGALLERY: Protesters march from Cheri A.

Alvin RiosAlvin Rios, 40, was left "in an emergent, life-threatening status without appropriate medical attention” before he was found dead in the jail on July 20, 2011, according to New York's Commission of Correction. Rios, who was born in Puerto Rico, was employed as a painter at the time of his death.Rios was arrested at a local motel on July 19, 2011, on a warrant for criminal possession of a controlled substance. He died the next day.A June 2012 report on Rios' death by the state Commission of Correction accuses the Correctional Medical Care Inc., the county's for-profit medical care provider, of failing to follow its own procedures in the hours before Rios' death.Buy PhotoBlack Lives Matter protest at the Broome County Jail, June 4, 2020. (Photo: Kate Collins / Binghamton Press & Sun-Bulletin)According to the report, CMC failed to implement its own intoxication and withdrawal policy and procedure after Rios was booked into the jail at 4:48 p.m. on the day he was arrested. Medical workers and jail personnel are identified only by their initials in the report, which is heavily redacted.Among the commission's findings is that the doctor who was at the jail for more than eight hours on July 20, 2011, was never made aware of Rios' condition. In a statement later to the Commission of Correction, the doctor said he "never touched the chart.”At 4:21 p.m. on July 20, 2011, a corrections officer heard a "thud” from Rios' cell, according to the report."Officer D.T. checked on Rios and saw him laying face down and shaking,” the report states. The officer then notified a registered nurse on staff, but Rios was pronounced dead less than an hour later.The wrongful-death lawsuit ended in a $62,500 settlement.Salladin BartonA lawsuit by the mother of Salladin Prince Barton, 35, argued he "died an absolutely inhumane and preventable death" on Jan. 14, 2015, which was brought on by untreated pneumonia and two drugs that should not have been prescribed together.For at least a decade, court records said, Barton had suffered from a recurrent, severe and well-documented mental illness.After a visit to UHS Wilson Medical Center in late 2014, the jail was advised to restrict and monitor Barton's water intake due to his medical condition, but the lawsuit argues the hospital's recommendation was not followed.A lawsuit was filed in the Broome County Supreme Court in 2015 claiming Barton was subjected to beatings, deprived of medical care and verbally abused during his 19-months at the jail.Barton had been incarcerated since June 10, 2013, on a violation of probation, as well as felony counts of first-degree robbery, second-degree robbery and fourth-degree grand larceny. He was being held while awaiting trial or release from jail by order from a judge.According to the suit, unidentified corrections officers tormented Salladin by calling him "vile" names and making threats to his family, as well as other tactics such as placing food beyond his reach and throwing it away.Buy PhotoBlack Lives Matter protest at the Broome County Jail, June 4, 2020. (Photo: Kate Collins / Binghamton Press & Sun-Bulletin)A prior ruling by U.S. District Court Judge David Hurd said evidence in the lawsuit case established Barton's death could have been avoided if the county and its policymakers had taken action to protect inmates in their custody from "CMC's profit-driven model of constitutionally inadequate medical care."The Broome County Attorney's Office responded to the lawsuit in May 2016, by denying the accusations and arguing that jail medical staff were not equipped or experienced enough to treat Barton. The county also maintained officials at the jail were not directly involved in any actions that resulted in his death.After four years, the case settled in federal court for $170,000 in April of this year.Reporter Maggie Gilroy also contributed to this report.
