Hosted in part by Black Lives Matter Knoxville, the protest took place in the parking lot of the police building, 800 Howard Baker Jr. Ave., starting at 6 p.m."We demand justice for all our brothers and sisters murdered by police!" the Black Lives Matter Knoxville Facebook page stated, adding that attendees should bring masks, signs and "noise makers.""All Americans have a constitutional right to gather and peacefully demonstrate," Knoxville Police Department spokesman Scott Erland said Friday morning.'Say his name':How Knoxville protested the killing of George FloydThe planned protest came amid growing unrest across the country after a white police officer was captured on video driving his knee into the neck of Floyd, a 46-year-old handcuffed black man, in Minneapolis. Floyd died Monday after the officer kept him pinned to the ground for nine minutes despite the victim pleading, "I can't breathe."Four Minneapolis Police Department officers were fired. Derek Chauvin, the officer who knelt on Floyd's neck, was arrested Friday on charges of third-degree murder and manslaughter, prosecutors said.In a joint statement issued shortly before news of the arrest broke, Knoxville Mayor Indya Kincannon and Knoxville Police Chief Eve Thomas condemned the actions of the former Minneapolis officers, saying in part: "We are outraged by the brutal actions of the officers involved in the death of George Floyd. We condemn this egregious behavior and will work tirelessly to make sure nothing like this ever happens in our community.”Gov. Bill Lee on Thursday made similar comments, saying the ex-officers "should be brought to justice for the loss of that life," and that "police brutality is not law enforcement.""Police brutality should not be accepted in this state and it shouldn't be tolerated," Lee said during his daily COVID-19 news briefing. "I don't believe we should or will tolerate it in the days ahead. It's unacceptable."In a tweet that has been shared widely, Chattanooga Police Chief David Roddy wrote: "There is no need to see more video. There is no need to wait to see how it 'plays out.' There is no need to put a knee on someone's neck for NINE minutes. There IS a need to DO something. If you wear a badge and you don't have an issue with this... turn it in."In Memphis, where protests against police brutality over two nights have ended without violence, Mayor Jim Strickland similarly condemned the actions of the four officers. He also criticized local protesters for not observing social distancing during the pandemic.Protests in several American cities, however, turned violent Thursday night. In Minneapolis, police retreated as protesters set fire to a precinct and others looted buildings. President Donald Trump on Twitter then criticized the city's mayor, called protesters "thugs" and wrote "when the looting starts, the shooting starts." Twitter later put a notice on that tweet saying it violated rules about "glorifying violence."In Louisville, Kentucky, hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old black EMT who was shot dead in March by police serving a controversial "no-knock" search warrant. Gunfire rang out in Louisville on Thursday night after a group of protesters attacked an armored vehicle; at least seven people were shot and wounded, the Courier-Journal reported. Louisville police said officers did not fire their guns.In Denver, Colorado, unidentified gunfire outside the state capitol building sent protesters running for cover, the Associated Press reported. Police there fired tear gas canisters and rubber bullets at protesters, who blocked traffic and smashed vehicles, the AP reported. Videos posted on social media also showed a vehicle striking a protester.What do the Knoxville protesters want?The Facebook page for the Knoxville protest said protesters were demanding criminal charges for "killer cops," more mental health professionals instead of additional police officers, more resources for the city's independent police review board and the implementation of body-worn cameras for officers.City officials already are working to equip Knoxville Police Department officers with body cameras. Money for the cameras was included in Mayor Kincannon's budget proposal, which was adopted by city council last week. In January, Kincannon said she hoped to have officers wearing body cameras by this summer; Police Chief Eve Thomas said then she hoped to have it done by July 1."Steps continue to be taken to get the cameras 'on the street' as soon as possible," reads Friday's joint statement from Kincannon and Thomas.A renewed push for body cameras came after Knoxville Police Department officer Dylan Williams fatally shot Channara "Philly" Pheap after a struggle in August 2019. Investigating authorities for months declined to release key details about the shooting, and activists cited the lack of information to call for increased transparency and body cameras.Those calls grew in intensity after the Knox County Regional Forensic Center released a preliminary document to Pheap's family that listed his cause of death as "gunshot wound of back."Prosecutors ultimately declined to charge Williams, saying the evidence showed he was justified in shooting Pheap after Pheap choked him, grabbed his Taser and used it on him when the officer tried to arrest him in connection to a hit-and-run. Pheap, who was of Cambodian descent, likely turned to the side just as Williams, who is white, fired his service weapon, authorities said.The dashboard camera in Williams' cruiser captured Pheap fighting the officer before the shooting. The shooting itself was not caught on video.Full statement from Knoxville officialsBelow is the full statement from Mayor Kincannon and Chief Thomas on the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.Knoxville Mayor Indya Kincannon and Police Chief Eve Thomas issued a joint statement today (May 29, 2020), condemning the actions of the Minneapolis police officers involved in the death of George Floyd. On Monday, Floyd died in police custody after repeatedly saying "I can't breathe,” as an officer was kneeling on his neck. The City leaders state, "We are outraged by the brutal actions of the officers involved in the death of George Floyd. We condemn this egregious behavior and will work tirelessly to make sure nothing like this ever happens in our community.”Mayor Kincannon went on to say, "I watched the video of a Minneapolis police officer pressing his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck continuously for at least 9 minutes, despite Mr. Floyd's pleas that he could not breathe, despite on-lookers begging the officers to let him breathe. It is completely horrifying. The Minneapolis police officers' actions are unjustified and inhumane. My heart goes out to the Floyd family. We are all impacted by this senseless death."I understand that incidents like this undermine a community's trust in those who are supposed to protect and serve them. They challenge all of us to acknowledge racism and work actively against it, at all levels of government and in all corners of our communities. While this happened hundreds of miles away, Chief Thomas and I are committed, here in Knoxville, to continue to take proactive measures to make sure officers are properly trained and understand this type of behavior will not be tolerated.”Chief Thomas echoed the Mayor's statements and added, "I was deeply disturbed and appalled by the events that led to the death of George Floyd, and condemn the actions and inactions of the former Minneapolis police officers that resulted in this unimaginable and entirely avoidable tragedy. Those former officers have left an indelible stain on the badge of every officer who continues to work toward the betterment of their community every single day. The conduct exhibited is neither taught nor accepted in our profession, and it severely undermines the strides law enforcement agencies across the country have made to earn the trust of their communities."I commend the immediate action taken by Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo to terminate those officers. Police officers have a foundational duty and responsibility to treat all individuals with dignity, decency and respect, and must be held accountable when they fail in that basic principle of public service. Behavior that does not represent the values of the profession or serve to improve the well-being of the community should never be tolerated."The Knoxville Police Department will continue to hold its officers to the highest ethical standard, provide the training necessary to ensure the best possible outcome in all scenarios, and work with the community to build and maintain a relationship of trust and mutual understanding.” Excessive use of force is illegal and entirely inconsistent with KPD's mission to prevent crime and keep the peace. Mayor Kincannon and Chief Thomas say officers will continue to be trained thoroughly in human relations, cultural diversity, ethics in policing and de-escalation tactics, both during the Recruit Academy and throughout their careers. Ongoing training is provided during regular in-service courses and daily squad roll calls as well as through the review, adjustment and enforcement of policies. The addition of body-worn cameras is another tool to help increase transparency and accountability. The money to implement and maintain the cameras was recently approved by City Council. Steps continue to be taken to get the cameras "on the street” as soon as possible.Mayor Kincannon said, "Putting my support behind bodycams was one of my first major actions as Mayor, and I will continue to put public safety as the top priority of my administration. We hear the concerns of our community. Everyone in Knoxville, no matter their skin color, has a right to feel safe and to be treated fairly and humanely."Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Public Notices Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My AccountSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJob Network Cars Homes Classifieds 10Best Reviewed Reach Local© 2020 www.knoxnews.com.
