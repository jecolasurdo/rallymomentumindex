Associated Press/PATRICK SEMANSKY Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save SOUTH BEND — Black Lives Matter South Bend activists say they plan to keep following former mayor and Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg to his campaign events, distributing written materials and disrupting his speeches, either by raising money and traveling themselves or enlisting the help of other BLM chapters.On Friday, three South Bend members flew to Los Angeles to protest outside a homeless shelter in Watts, as Buttigieg and a city council member toured the facility and spoke with people staying there. On Sunday, activists followed him to Des Moines, Iowa, criticizing his "1,000 Houses in 1,000 Days” initiative, his efforts on homelessness and the strained relations between police and black residents.As Buttigieg spoke on a stage in Des Moines, a protester interrupted him. Buttigieg took a knee and reached out to shake his hand. The man initially declined but ultimately extended his hand, while continuing to talk. Before a police officer escorted the protester out, he yelled, "What happened to the accountability you promised for the South Bend Police Department?” "I think your facts are a little wrong, so I'd love a chance to talk with you about it, but I'd like for us to talk about it respectfully,” Buttigieg told the man.The crowd, estimated by the campaign to be more than 750 people, then drowned out the protesters with chants of "BOOT EDGE EDGE!”The man was Chris Broadnax, a member of Black Lives Matter South Bend, said Jorden Giger, a chapter co-leader.Giger and Melina Abdullah, a founder of the nation's first BLM chapter in Los Angeles, said the group invited the South Bend members to the Watts protest, paying their hotel costs and driving them around while the members raised donations to pay for the airfare."We've had a really great ongoing relationship with the folks in South Bend,” said Abdullah, a professor of Pan-African studies at California State University, Los Angeles. Abdullah said she reached out to the South Bend chapter after learning of the Buttigieg event. She came to South Bend in June, after the fatal shooting of Eric Logan by a police officer, and has helped Giger and other local residents establish a chapter in the city. Abdullah described the group's activities as "bird dogging” Buttigieg."This is kind of one of the strategies we utilize,” Abdullah said. "Not just disrupt but educate people who are at his events about what is not so great about them. What we're doing with Mayor Pete is making sure everybody is aware of his record and his kind of race problem.”She added that other chapters would help South Bend members "if we have capacity.”Giger said South Bend members will attend as many Buttigieg events as they can afford. The group has been soliciting donations via email and social media. Giger and some other Black Lives Matter South Bend members support Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primary race, and Abudullah said she supported Julian Castro before he dropped out. Both said Black Lives Matter as an organization does not endorse candidates, but it does work against candidates it opposes."There are other Black Lives Matter groups who are doing organizing work, but for us specifically, it's not to say that the whole global network is specifically targeting Pete,” Giger said. "But after the Eric Logan shooting we had a conversation about keeping his name out there, making sure that the country is aware that police brutality is an issue for black people everywhere, and that Mayor Pete as a candidate, he's not done enough to address the issue of police violence here.”Sgt. Ryan O'Neill shot Logan in June while responding to reports of car break-ins at Central High Apartments. Authorities have said Logan approached O'Neill with a knife and ignored repeated orders to drop it. The knife had been taken from a car in the area, authorities have said. O'Neill, who resigned from the force a month later, did not have his body camera turned on at the time of the shooting.The Buttigieg campaign on Monday night released a statement from South Bend Common Council member Sharon McBride, a supporter of the campaign. She cited the city's efforts to find more affordable housing and shelter for the homeless."The opinions of South Bend Black Lives Matter are not necessarily representative of the black community in South Bend, many of whom are supportive of Pete and believe that our city has gotten better under his leadership,” McBride said in the statement. "While there's still more work that needs to be done, you can't deny that great progress has been made.” Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save L.A.
