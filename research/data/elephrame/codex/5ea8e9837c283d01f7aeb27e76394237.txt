A protest supporting the Black Lives Matter movement drew an estimated 1,500 people to the Ventura County Government Center Sunday afternoon, authorities said, with the peaceful gathering spilling onto surrounding streets for a time.The Ventura County Blackout event, organized primarily through social media posts, took place amid continuing protests around the country and abroad following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died on May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.More: Thousands line Simi Valley sidewalks in solidarity with Black Lives MatterSunday's gathering in Ventura also drew about 200 doctors, nurses, medical assistants and other health care professionals who took part in the larger protest as part of the White Coats for Black Lives effort.The group knelt together on the grass of the government center for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, the length of time the police officer knelt on Floyd's neck.The Ventura demonstration was scheduled from noon to 5 p.m., flyers for the event show. At around 1 p.m., protesters moved onto Victoria Avenue, where they knelt for a time before marching over the bridge above Highway 126, stopping traffic in both directions for a time.More: Oxnard's youth demand justice for George Floyd, Breonna TaylorThe group later split into three main gatherings, with some staying at the intersection of Victoria and Telephone Road, some assembling at Victoria and the 126, and others stopping at Thille Park, according to the Ventura County Sheriff's Office, which also provided the estimated crowd size of 1,500.As of 3 p.m., the protest had remained peaceful, a sheriff's official said, and no significant issues had been reported.Officials later raised their estimate of the crowd size to 1,600. Some protesters walked to police department headquarters at Ralston Street and Dowell Drive, officials said, and knelt outside the station.Toward the end of the demonstration, there was a report of a vehicle that hit a pedestrian then drove away from the scene. Ventura police responded to the incident and initially deemed it an accident. The driver reportedly told police he didn't feel safe at the scene and didn't realize the vehicle hit anyone. Four days later after different video of the incident came to the agency's attention, authorities were taking another look at what happened. Video shows a white pickup truck driving through a lane of traffic on Victoria Avenue where protesters had been standing. An adjacent traffic lane headed in the same direction was cleared of protesters. Sunday's was the second such large protest held locally over the weekend after a similar event in Simi Valley on Saturday attracted about 2,000, according to police estimates. Dozens of other protests have been organized across Ventura County.Gretchen Wenner covers breaking news for the Ventura County Star.
