He was only 12," said his sister, who answered to Tajik and refused to give her last name. "He wanted to play basketball or the NBA. He loved everybody. If he was still alive he would say thank you and he would love you."About 60 protestors rallied and marched near the Cudell Recreation Center, where Tamir was fatally shot Saturday. He died hours later on Sunday at MetroHealth Medical Center.Neighbors, students and community members mixed together in the streets, carrying signs that read, "Danger: Police in the area," and "Not one more police killing."Some residents peeped through their windows to watch as the marchers made their way down the sidewalks. Women in pink bathrobes emerged from their homes. Others ran outside to join the crowd."Hands up don't shoot," demonstrators yelled. "Who are we here for? Tamir."Speakers spoke of anger, frustration and resentment toward Cleveland police, which had no visible presence at the rally.The demonstration came the same day as city officials – including Mayor Frank Jackson and Cleveland Division of Police Chief Calvin Williams – tried to comfort a community trying to come to grips with the loss of a young boy.Officers responded to the recreation center about 3:30 p.m. Saturday for a report of a "male threatening people with a gun," police said. The officers were never told the caller who reported the gun said the gun may be fake, and the person pointing it at people may have been a juvenile, police said.The officers saw the boy put the gun in his waistband, according to police. When the officers told him to put his hands in the air, he reached into his waistband and pulled it out, police said. Officers fired two shots, at least one of which hit him in the stomach.Police later determined the gun was an airsoft-type gun with the orange safety cap removed.Police have not released the name of the officers involved in the shooting. Both men remain on paid leave. The Cleveland Division of Police also refused to release surveillance video of the shooting at the request of the Northeast Ohio Media Group.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
