More than 70 people, demanding justice for McDole and carrying signs accusing officers of being murderers, received a police escort from the southern portion of the city's Hill Top neighborhood to Wilmington's Louis L. Redding City/County Building where they railed against the lack of charges brought against the four officers.The McDole family started marching from their home on Second and Rodney streets with about 15 people. The group grew larger as they headed to the Adams Street Courts at Third and Jackson streets, where they were met by more people. After about an hour-long rally there, a group of more than 70 headed to downtown Wilmington, first on Fourth Street and then onto Market Street.Along the way, some protesters hurled insults at the officers escorting them. The officers continued working, even though protesters did not have a permit to hold the march."We allowed citizens to exercise their freedom of speech as long as the participants remained within the law," said Sgt. Andrea Janvier, a Wilmington police spokeswoman. "Our officers acted in a calm professional manner and the protest ended without incident."But when marchers got to the intersection of Ninth and Market streets, they were prevented from heading toward Rodney Square where children were participating in the annual Tennis in the Streets program."It felt like a slap in the face," said Mahkieb Booker, founder of the Delaware chapter of Black Lives Matter. "Why would you give us the escort and then we couldn't march any farther?"That just didn't make any sense."Initially Wilmington police Capt. Faheem Akil and a few other officers confronted the protesters, instructing them to head down Ninth Street. By the time the protesters, who by this time had shut the intersection, insisted on continuing on Market Street, more officers arrived.The additional officers, some wearing riot gear and clutching billy clubs, stood shoulder-to-shoulder preventing protesters access to the 900 block of Market Street. A group of officers on motorcycles lined behind them, and at least one officer farther down the block was holding a teargas gun.Protesters continued to insult and yell at officers. Many pulled out cellphones and videoed the impasse.In the end, protesters turned east onto Ninth Street, then turned right onto French Street where they huddled at their planned location – the park between the Carvel State Building and the Redding City/County Building.Wilmington attorney Thomas S. Neuberger found it disturbing that the protesters' path was blocked by police. But Kathleen MacRae, executive director of the ACLU of Delaware, said that had protesters been marching on the sidewalk the police would have had to let them proceed."If they are in the street, the police have the right to redirect traffic or restrict access to certain intersections," she said.The march came a week after the state Attorney General's Office issued a report that said the officers would not face criminal charges.March organizers said they planned the march months in advance, not knowing when the state Attorney General would be issuing his report on the Sept. 23 shooting."We're still marching for justice for Jeremy McDole," said his sister, Keandra McDole. "We had no intentions on the investigation being over with ... when we put this together."Besides wanting justice for her brother, McDole said they also want the city's violence to end and are asking people to put their guns down.Neuberger, one of the lawyers representing McDole's family in a federal civil lawsuit, said they had updated their civil complaint using some of the Attorney General's report. This includes using portions of interviews with the shooting officers explaining what they saw that caused them to fire at McDole.Despite not being allowed to continue on Market Street, McDole's mother, Phyllis McDole, said they got to their planned destination."This is where we wanted to be," she said.TIMELINE: Major events in the McDole caseSTORY: McDole shooting: Wilmington Police won't be chargedOPINION: City's response to McDole report troublingOnce at the Redding building, protesters wanted to know why criminal charges had not been filed against the four officers.In the report, prosecutors said they initially considered filing a felony assault charge against Senior Cpl. Joseph Dellose, an 11-year member of the force, and that he had shown "extraordinarily poor police work" during the incident.Dellose fired at McDole with a shotgun approximately two seconds after ordering him to put his hands up, the report found, creating uncertainty among other officers – Senior Cpl. Daniel Silva, Cpl. Thomas Lynch and Cpl. James MacColl – who, not knowing where the gunfire came from, turned their weapons on McDole, who used a wheelchair.An alliance of African-American leaders earlier this week asked the U.S. Department of Justice for a civil rights violation investigation into the shooting death.The U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Delaware said they were monitoring the situation and issued the following comment:"We have been aware of this incident and have been monitoring the local investigation. Now that the local investigation has concluded, DOJ will review the results of that investigation for possible violations of federal criminal civil rights statutes and conduct any further investigation that may be appropriate. DOJ will then make a determination as to whether prosecutable violations of the federal criminal civil rights statutes exist and take appropriate action.”New Castle County Councilman Jea Street, one of two people who sent the letter asking for the federal investigation, was outside the Redding building and spoke to protesters."There are two ways to do this. The right way and the wrong way," Street told the crowd. "I'm respectfully suggesting that the right way is to ask the federal authorities, ask for federal intervention, and I think if the federal government comes in we'll get a different result."Street also asked for peace and patience, but some in the crowd said they were tired of waiting. This included McDole's mother, who said she's been waiting since Sept. 23 for justice."How peaceful do you want me to be," she asked.After some more debate among the protesters, the rally ended shortly after 1:35 p.m. But not before activist Keith Evans encouraged people to be peaceful."The way that we're going to win is we walk away from here peacefully and we're quiet," he said. "Don't let these cops lock us up today because this is not the war. The battle is not over."Policing the USAContact Esteban Parra at (302) 324-2299, eparra@delawareonline.com or Twitter @eparra3.Staff Directory Corrections Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Public Notices Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My AccountSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJob Network Cars.com Wilmington Homes Classifieds Education 10Best Reviewed Moonlighting Reach Local© 2020 www.delawareonline.com.
