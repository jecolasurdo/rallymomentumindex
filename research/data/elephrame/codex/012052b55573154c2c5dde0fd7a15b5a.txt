STAFF PHOTO BY SCOTT THRELKELD Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Throngs of protestors marched from Duncan Plaza to New Orleans Police Headquarters in the afternoon heat on Saturday to denounce police brutality and express outrage over the death of black Americans at the hands of police.Near the front of the crowd, which stretched on for blocks, was a banner painted with the image of George Floyd, a 48-year-old black man killed by a policeman in Minneapolis, Minn., on Monday. A video of Floyd's death — in which a white officer can be seen driving his knee into Floyd's neck as he gasped for breath — has sparked days of demonstrations in dozens of cities across the U.S.The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter in Floyd's death. He, along with three other officers involved in the incident, were fired earlier in the week.In New Orleans, marchers stopped several times during the protest to spread out and establish social distancing, a nod to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic that's torn through New Orleans. Nearly all wore masks, though the crowd — which numbered perhaps as many as a few thousand — far exceeded the limits on gatherings imposed by Mayor LaToya Cantrell in an effort to slow the virus's spread.Hundreds more gathered in Duncan Plaza later Saturday evening to again protest Floyd's death and denounce what they see as wider systems of oppression toward minorities. A number of transgender activists spoke about harassment, marginalization and violence in their community and led chants remembering Tony McDade, a black transgender man who was fatally shot by police in Tallahassee, Florida, on Wednesday after allegedly killing his neighbor with a knife.Loud chants accompanied the march — "no justice, no peace, no racist police,” "death to the racist pig” and "f--- the police,” among others — as New Orleans cops on motorcycles sped ahead to clear traffic along the way. Police have generally given protesters a wide berth in New Orleans, both at the afternoon march and other demonstrations, and the crowd, though palpably frustrated, was entirely peaceful.The large march was organized by Take 'Em Down NOLA, an activist group that's fought to remove Confederate and white supremacist monuments in the city, and the New Orleans Workers Group, a socialist organization. Several other groups, including the Hospitality Workers Alliance, also joined the march.Signs demanded "Justice for Floyd” while others named dozens of other black people whose deaths in recent years, most at the hands of police, have also prompted protests. Among them was Alton Sterling, who was fatally shot by Baton Rouge police in 2016.Some carried signs with the name of Modesto Reyes, who was shot to death by Jefferson Parish sheriff's deputies on Wednesday night. Jefferson Parish Sheriff Joe Lopinto said Reyes, 35, had led deputies on a chase and was shot only after pointing a gun at officers.In Marrero on Saturday evening, a crowd of a few hundred people marched to the spot where Reyes, a popular musician and rapper, was shot dead. Taser video shows moment Marrero man is fatally shot by JPSO deputy; family remains skepticalReyes' family members and friends contend footage from the officer's Taser camera refutes JPSO's version of events, said Reyes' little brother, Alfonso Rowland, 30.They believe Reyes was holding his phone in his hand and that the video should prove that the deputy – who was standing just as close to Reyes as the camera – should have known it was a cell phone.Speakers said they have for years been subjected to unnecessary traffic stops, especially in Marrero. They demanded deputies wear body cameras and that police shouldn't investigate themselves when there are officer-involved shootings."We need someone else to do the crime scene,” said David Jones, 31. "Because every time deputies get behind us, we get scared. And they need to have someone powerful behind them too.”During stops along the route in New Orleans, as well as at a rally on the steps in front of police headquarters, organizers of the march gave fiery speeches denouncing what they described as an entire economic and social system deeply infused with racism and built on the exploitation of working-class black folks in New Orleans.They criticized deep divides in pay, wages and living conditions in the city and the long legacy of slavery and racial segregation. One speaker decried the lack of investment in affordable housing and homeless services but, pointing to the nearby Orleans Parish jail, mockingly noted that "we provide that kind of housing.”"What got me to come out here was frustration, anger,” said Josh Green, who marched on Saturday with a group of friends. "You can only take so much before you're pushed and you feel that you have to do something ... This protest right now is out of frustration, it's out of saying I'm tired of this s--t, I'm sick of the status quo. My value as a black person and my life is more important than anything else right now.”"It could happen to anybody, it could happen to me,” said Alexander Lewis, who was with Green. Both men are young and black. "I have a mom who wants to see me again. I care about my life and I just feel like it just needs to stop.”"I'm mixed race. I would not exist if it weren't for the civil rights movement. This is something I've believed in since day one,” said another marcher who gave his name as Alex, adding that watching the news from Minnesota has been "absolutely exhausting and infuriating.”"It's tough with coronavirus happening right now,” he said, "but we have to realize there's a bigger pandemic happening that we have to fight against.”"Racism and COVID,” added his friend, who identified herself as DeeDee, "The top pandemics of our time.” Email Bryn Stole at bstole@theadvocate.com or Katy Reckdahl at kreckdahl@theadvocate.com.
