Croteau | scroteau@masslive.com WORCESTER -- With their voices echoing through the night air in front of City Hall, a group of people rallying in support of protesters facing possible criminal charges said they will not be intimidated and will further speak out for change.Those in the group, including one man who could face criminal charges in connection to the January protest, also said the city's attempt to come up with a compromise was just another tactic to silence voices.Michael Jerry, a member of Communities United Collective, said he heard about the offer by City Manager Edward Augustus Jr. not to have criminal charges pursued in court if the group agreed not to block traffic in future protests."We consider that to be quite disingenuous," Jerry said. "The issue is not about being in the streets and disrupting traffic. It's about addressing oppression, the systemic oppression. His offer should be about ways to fix that not to keep us out the street."Jerry, who would not say if he was at the January protest in Kelley Square, said the protest was to grab people's attention to discuss the deaths of unarmed black men by authorities across the county.He found it interesting that the video authorities used to identify protesters and file charges against some of them also showed a truck move toward the protesters, but yet no charges are being filed against that driver.Jerry said people involved in the civil disobedience in Kelley Square, where traffic was blocked for 277 seconds, were prepared to be accused of being in breech of a very minor infraction by authorities.He said early police reports filed after officers responded to the scene called the protest well organized and the protesters were compliant. It was only after the video gained traction on the Internet that police decided to look for charges, he said."This is not about the police executing their duties," Jerry said. "This is about intentionally targeting Communities United Collective and the other demonstrators, trying to silence protests, trying to silence civil disobedience."Police Chief Gary Gemme said earlier this week that the charges being sought are because public safety was jeopardized during the protest. The video showed one man jumping on a truck. His department has seen protests in the past and respects people's First Amendment rights, the chief said earlier in the week.Jerry doesn't believe anyone should face charges. The group said two people are being brought to a clerk magistrate's hearing Wednesday in court to see if the charges will hold.Robert Blackwell Gibbs, one of the people who could be charged with disturbing the peace and being a disorderly person, read a poem at the rally. It was called, "Open Letter to the City I Love."He discussed people's right to speak out and his belief that people's voices cannot be taken away."Dear Eddie, are we having fun yet? After we leave here, are you going to run and call the chief again? I wonder what he'll charge me with this time," Gibbs said in the poem.Gibbs, who declined to speak at length about the charges, said Augustus' offer was more of an ultimatum than a compromise.As people held signs and cheered for the speakers, it was clear the group felt the city was trying to keep them quiet.James Patin, a 19-year-old Clark University student and member of Socialist Alternative, believes the possible charges being sought are a scare tactic. He also didn't agree with the deal proposed by city officials."That's not a compromise, that's silencing," he said. "That's one more blatant attempt to keep us from expressing our right to freedom of speech."People from the group rallying at City Hall said at no time was public safety jeopardized during the protest in Kelley Square.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).Â© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
