Students disciplined for wearing Confederate flag, saying 'Go back to Africa' - nj.comSkip to ArticleGloucester CountyStudents disciplined for wearing Confederate flag, saying 'Go back to Africa' Updated Jan 16, 2019; Posted Nov 08, 2017 By Joe Brandt | For NJ.com DEPTFORD TWP. -- Racial tension at the Gloucester County Institute of Technology came to a head last week after a group of students wore Confederate flag shirts and used racial slurs in response to classmates protesting racial inequality and past incidents.Administrators, faculty and students from the African American Culture Club met with Gloucester County NAACP President Loretta Winters on Monday to address the incidents and what could change going forward.There, students from the club explained that they wore black during Spirit Week as a form of silent protest and in support of Black Lives Matter. A member of the club showed NJ Advance Media the club's statement to administrators at the meeting."Many have been called the N-word to their face," the students said. "Someone was told if they don't like discrimination, they should bleach their skin. Others have been spit on."Principal Jamie Dundee addressed concerns about comments made during Spirit Week in a letter to parents on Friday."The administration was informed of various comments that were of an alarming nature," Dundee wrote. "As the investigation unfolded, we learned that a group of students posted comments over social media that contained racial and defaming slurs."Superintendent Mike Dicken said school administrators were still investigating and he could not say how many students were facing discipline. But he said the school is moving forward after the incidents, and that it did not disrupt students' education.Spirit Week mix-upSpirit Week goes as follows!! pic.twitter.com/HMqDz9wnUp— GCIT Student Council (@gcitsc2018) October 30, 2017 Spirit Week began last Wednesday with "America Day," and students were asked to wear red, white and blue and have their homeroom teacher count the number of students dressed up.A handful of students wore black because they "were as a whole frustrated and fed up" with dealing with past racial incidents, the statement from the African American Culture Club says."We the students came together and made the decision of wearing black to silently protest what is happening, to demand equality and fairness as an American, and to unite together as one," the statement continues.While it was meant to be a silent protest, it got other students talking on social media, criticizing the protest as drawing attention away from Spirit Week. And when another student posted on Snapchat calling for classmates to wear the Confederate flag in response, the students made plans to continue wearing black.The students in the AACC gathered screenshots of other students' social media posts criticizing the protests, along with reports of racist comments made in the school in response. Some defended wearing the Confederate flag, one saying doing so was "supporting the South" while another told a student to "learn their history.""Students have also been verbally abusing African American Culture Club members by saying 'Go back to Africa' and using derogatory statements such as [the N-word]," the students said.Hope for changeDicken called the Monday meeting with the NAACP "a really positive meeting about culture and climate." He said the school has students who "come to us from all different cities in our county" and that creates a diverse school that he wants to be a positive environment.Winters said school officials made a commitment to racial equity at the meeting, and hopes that students who wore the Confederate flag can grow to understand why it may upset black classmates. The African American Culture Club later met with students who wore the flag to exchange perspectives."The Confederate flag is to the black community as the Swastika is to the Jewish community," she said, noting that there are feelings of "pain and suffering" that it brings up."It's the flag used by the KKK, and they're a terrorist group," she said. "People need to be educated on what the Confederate flag stands for and what it means. ... How do you support that? How do you support any terrorist group?"Unlike a recent incident at Washington Township High School that resulted in a fight, Dicken said there was no physical violence at the school.Winters said she felt school administrators were "doing everything within their power to make sure that all their policies and procedures are enforced."Dundee said in his letter that it was the intention of the school to "promote tolerance, acceptance and unity for all of our students and staff."Joe Brandt can be reached at jbrandt@njadvancemedia.com.
