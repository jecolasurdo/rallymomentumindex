Officers used pepper balls during the arrest, IMPD said.Robert Bently, 41, of Indianapolis, was arrested on suspicion of obstruction of traffic and disorderly conduct, IMPD spokesperson Michael Hewitt said."During the arrest IMPD Officers were forced to use pepper ball deployment to deter a crowd as they closed in on officers creating an unsafe environment for Officers and Protesters," Hewitt wrote in an email to news outlets. "No officers or protesters were injured during this arrest. IMPD supports our citizens rights to peaceful and lawful protest."A live video posted to Facebook showed a confrontation at the intersection between IMPD and protesters.In the video, at least one person is arrested, and protesters are screaming while an officer shoots what appears to be a pepper ball gun toward the crowd.The video was shot by Jalen Sanders and shows a small group of protesters and officers, with emotions running high."Look y'all,” Sanders says in the video. "They out here shooting us.”As frustration and anger boiled over, organizers are heard urging protesters to sit down and put their hands up. An officer keeps a pepper ball gun trained on the group.A protester yells at officers asking: "This is how you get a pay check?!”Another video of the arrest, from a different vantage point, shows an officer swinging at baton at protesters crowded around as IMPD makes the arrest. It's unclear what prompted the situation to escalate, but videos circulating on social media before the incident underscore how quickly a single interaction seemed to become a flashpoint.In a Facebook Live taken shortly before the arrest, Sanders's camera is focused on two officers in a parking lot.One is standing, with his arms grasping the collar of his vest. Another leans against a police vehicle. There are only a handful of protesters in front of them, but the anger is palpable.Police have warned them not to move closer.Some of the protesters shout profanities at the officers, who don't respond. "You want to kill me?" one protester shouts at the police. "He's ready to kill someone. Kill me. Kill me."Shortly thereafter, the officer leaning against the car shifts positions. In doing so, he touches his holster for a second. The handful of protesters are irate. "Don't touch your......!" one yells.As news of the protest and confrontation spread on social media, the crowd grew to around 100 people. They lined the intersection of Michigan Road and West 62nd Street, holding signs and chanting. Cars continuously honked in support as they passed by. "What do we want?" the crowd chanted. "Body cams. When do we want them? Now."In a Facebook Live video, photographer Keith "Wildstyle" Paschall echoed the sentiment. "It was a shock to me that I read in the IndyStar that we're the only major city that doesn't have ... body cameras," he said. "I didn't realize we were that far behind.”On the night Indianapolis police officers shot and killed two men — including Reed — there was no bodycam footage because the 1,700-person force doesn't have body cameras. An IndyStar analysis has found Indianapolis is the largest city in the nation without a body camera program. Reed, 21, was shot and killed Wednesday night near the intersection of Michigan Road and West 62nd Street.The shooting set off a series of protests near the shooting scene and in downtown Indianapolis.'He didn't deserve to die like that': Reed's dad speaks after Facebook Live shootingReed broadcast via Facebook Live as police were chasing him prior to the shooting.
