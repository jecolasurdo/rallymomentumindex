The protest came with the Twitter hashtag #royalshutdown, nodding to British royalty Prince William and Kate Middleton's expected attendance at the game.With William & Kate expected, protesters stormed Barclays Center tonight for a #royalshutdown http://t.co/4M2eZPLi1v pic.twitter.com/1NSmldE7Ba— New York Post (@nypost) December 9, 2014 "It's not a Cavs thing, it's a worldly thing," said James, who in 2012 led a protest on the Miami Heat of the death of Trayvon Martin when the players appeared at their hotel wearing hooded sweatshirts."It's just to understand what we're going through as a society," James continued. "I've been quoted over and over as far as what's going on, it's more of a notion to the family. More than anything. As a society we have to do better. We have to be better for one another, don't matter what race you are."James has been outspoken over the past month about the deaths of unarmed African-Americans at the hands of police officers. In July, a Ferguson, Missouri police officer shot and killed Mike Brown. Last month, a grand jury declined to indict the police officer, setting off a wave of protests.Also last month, a Cleveland police officer shot and killed 12-year-old Tamir Rice, who was playing with a pellet gun in a public area when police responded to a call. James said at Madison Square Garden Thursday that "this is our country, the land of the free, and we keep having these incidents happen, innocent victims or whatever the case may be. Our families are losing loved ones."Irving hadn't spoken about the incidents until Monday night, when reporters spotted him walking through the locker room in the T-shirt. The shirts came from former Cavalier Jarrett Jack.A Cleveland team official said Jack brought three T-shirts into the locker room, but it was not immediately clear who has the third one. Jack, Kevin Garnett, Deron Williams, and Alan Anderson wore them for the Nets.KG, Deron Williams, Jay-Z, Jarrett Jack and Alan Anderson.

"It's truly important that we do."NBA Commissioner Adam Silver was at the Cavs-Nets game and told the Associated Press:"I respect Derrick Rose and all of our players for voicing their personal views on important issues but my preference would be for players to abide by our on-court attire rules."The players are not expected to be fined for wearing the shirts.Cleveland's Shawn Marion said he didn't get one of the shirts, but wanted one. "It's a good cause," he said.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
