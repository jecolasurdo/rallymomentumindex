Several people got together at the National Civil Rights Museum on Saturday to take a stand against police violence The group chanted for change and marched down Main Street with a casket above their heads. Some also held signs pleading justice for Mike Brown, the unarmed teenager killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. "I have a son. I have a 19-year-old son," Aisha Raison said. "That could have been my son." For people., like Raison, the deadly shooting hits close to home. Though the teenager was killed nearly 300 miles away, Raison said this shooting is the reality of how law enforcement views the black community across the country.

"The world is watching," Raison said. As protests calling for answers and change continue across the country, people in Memphis are making sure their voices add to the noise.

"Our voices need to be heard and we also have to take that energy and put it into action and we need to organize, organize, organize...that's the only way we're going to get the changes we need to see here in Memphis, in Ferguson, and in the United States," he said. The group has no plans on stopping the movement. Another "Enough Is Enough" or "Hands Up" protest is planned for Monday, August 18.
