Updated: 12:52 PM EST Jan 4, 2017 Brian Hamrick Reporter As jury selection for the Ray Tensing murder trial begins, so do protests outside the Hamilton County Courthouse. On Monday, protestors called for the conviction of the former University of Cincinnati police officer. "The spirit of what we're trying to organize is to have voices down here every day letting everyone know we won't be satisfied unless there's a conviction,” Black Lives Matter organizer Brian Taylor said. It was a multiracial gathering of about 50 people. Many of them wore shirts with Black Lives Matter printed on the front. There were members of other organizations represented too. Some just came out individually to show support. "We care and we're not going to let it go idly to the side,” said Rosemary Parker, who lives in Cincinnati but was visiting Washington, D.C., and drove all night to be at the protest. Taylor said even without going into the courtroom, the group has a part in the trial. "We don't have the illusion this will be brought about short of pressure," Taylor said. Some believe what happens in this case will have far-reaching effects. "It's very personal. We want to bring justice in the Sam Dubose case, but nationally I do believe it might have a very resonating importance,” Black Lives Matter steering committee member Mario Martone said. About a half-dozen Cincinnati bike officers patrolled at a distance. The protest was loud at times but ended as it began, peacefully.
