No one is hurt by a decision to sit or kneel, and a dialogue has certainly begun. While the Concordia-St. Paul players brought the movement to Brown County, the protest had been on my mind for a while. I'd been scanning the players at high school and college events to see if anyone would dissent. I also found that I was standing a little straighter and looking more intently at the flag — almost to make up for those who were not.I've always enjoyed the national anthem. The way I figure it, I've heard it played more than most people my age.As the daughter of a coach, later a player and now working in sports, I've attended live events an average of two or three times a week ever since I was 6 years old. With a running time of about a minute and a half, I've respectfully stood during the playing of the "Star Spangled Banner” for nearly four cumulative days.Thinking about it that way, four days seems like the least amount I could give to a country that affords me so many freedoms. The United States certainly isn't perfect, but to borrow a phrase from the Preamble to the Constitution, I can't think of a "more perfect” union.There is no place the national anthem is played more frequently than at a sporting event. It's challenging to think of another setting to hear it performed. It's not like we hear of "the twilight's last gleaming” before actors take the stage at the theater or before Jay-Z begins rapping at a concert. So how did sports and the national anthem become so intertwined that such a protest could be born? For that answer, we need a bit of a history lesson.Written during a battle in 1814 by Francis Scott Key, the lyrics were set to the tune of a popular British drinking song. The "Star Spangled Banner” consists of four verses, only the first of which is sung today. The fourth was always my favorite. The song officially became the national anthem in 1931, despite being used alongside tunes such as "Yankee Doodle,” "My County, 'Tis of Thee” and "America the Beautiful” when an official song was called for prior to that.According to United States Code, 36 U.S.C. 301, during a rendition of the national anthem, when the flag is displayed, all persons except those in uniform should stand at attention facing the flag with their right hand over their heart. Those in uniform are to salute from the first note through the last. However, there is no penalty associated with violations.It isn't clear when the tradition of tying the anthem to sports began. The consensus is sometime in the late 1800s. However, it was in 1919, just after World War I, that the bond became permanent. During the World Series between the Cubs and Red Sox, one player, Fred Thomas, was on active duty, but playing while on furlough from the Navy. When the military band struck up the "Star Spangled Banner” during the seventh inning stretch, Thomas snapped to attention. His teammates in the field followed suit, and the crowd, already on their feet, sang along. The New York Times reported on the event in its recap of the game the following day. Because of the attention it received, the "Star Spangled Banner” was played during the seventh inning stretch of each of the remaining games as wounded soldiers were given free tickets to attend.Over the next decade, the song was played for the World Series and holiday games, eventually transforming into the daily institution it is now. With baseball being the national pastime, the tradition carried over to other sports. The tradition has received a boost in popularity during various times, such as during World War II — when it was played prior to all baseball games — and following 9/11.Considering the national anthem's link to sports and patriotism, maybe the kneeling protests are a fitting way to show one's dissatisfaction with the country. Or maybe it's just a way for people to feel like they are standing up for something without doing anything at all.I guess that's something for us all to think about.Follow @ejhoros_AAN on Twitter.

Yet I am constantly followed and harrassed by white cops. So I say keep on kneeling. Keep on agitating. Report Add Reply Rollin Stearns Sep 25, 2016 2:18pm There is a time and place for everything. Disrespecting our nation's national anthem is NOT proving anything except how spoiled rotten they are! Remember it started with a privileged overpaid football player who doesn't seem very oppressed.
