"But when I look at my family members and friends who are immigrants, it shows me Mexico is sending their best.”Huapilla was one of several members of the Culturas de las Razas Unidasstudent group who participated in Wednesday's protest.Their cheers of "Black Lives Matter” and "Build bridges, not walls” were muffled to those inside the ballroom as Trump Jr. took the stage shortly after 12:30 p.m."If we allow the most corrupt candidate in the history of the president (to win)... we're saying pay for play is okay, that insider dealing and corruption” are OK, Trump Jr. said.The eldest of Trump's children also played to the crowd of MSU students, starting a "Go Green, Go White” chant and referencing the Spartan's hated rival, the University of Michigan, and its football coach, Jim Harbaugh."I've been a politician for two weeks now,” he said, "and I know enough not to wear khakis on campus.”Elections 2016Voter Guide: See where the candidates stand on issues important to MichiganFree Press EndorsementsFull list of endorsementsPresident of the United StatesMichigan Supreme CourtU.S. House and State House seatsState Board of EducationUniversity boards, elected through statewide voteRegional Transit Authority MillageCircuit and probate court judges in metro DetroitMacomb County Public Works CommissionerOakland County ExecutiveOther Oakland County racesWayne County schools millageDistrict court judges in metro DetroitDetroit community benefits proposals, Detroit city councilDetroit Public Schools Community District BoardBringing Trump Jr. to campus helps to balance out the litany of Clinton surrogates who've visited MSU during the campaign, said Justin Gould, vice chair of the MSU College Republicans."We wanted to bring different speakers to campus to share different viewpoints,” he said. "We want to represent our side and share the Republican and conservative message with students."Numerous politicians and advocates have visited MSU in recent months, including Ben Carson and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. Trump Jr. also isn't the first family member of a candidate to visit East Lansing. Chelsea Clinton visited East Lansing in September on behalf of her mother.Trump Jr. also met with a couple dozen supporters in Detroit on Wednesday morning and was scheduled to attend a campaign event at Grand Valley State University in Allendale later Wednesday.At the Michigan Republican Party's office in Detroit, Trump Jr. said his father is prepared to get rid of regulations that hamper both developers and small business owners."He's been anti-regulation since Day 1. Imagine opening up your doors and you have to go through the Dodd Frank thousands of pages of nonsense written by bureaucrats in D.C. That's the problem with these politicians they do that for job security,” Trump Jr. said, referring to the federal reform of banking regulations passed in response to the recent recession. "The amount of over-regulation has become such a burden. We can't be a free market when we have all this excessive regulation.”He also said is father is solidly anti-abortion and will appoint Supreme Court justices who will follow the constitution."This is not just a four- or eight-year election. This is a 40-year election,” he said. "This election is about the core principles of America."►Related: Final frenzied week of election proves Michigan is a battlegroundPlenty of other campaign activity is happening this week with Vermont Sen.
