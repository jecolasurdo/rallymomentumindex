Police have not released details about what led to the confrontation between the officer and the deceased. Assistant Police Chief Chris Bailey said the suspect had a gun and that he and the officer were the only two at the scene when the shooting occurred. They have not yet identified they fatally shot. However, a family member at the scene identified the man as Sean Reed.Tiona Reed, 37, who said she is Sean Reed's aunt, said through tears that the family has not received any information about what happened. "Maybe if they weren't here, we could get some more information," she said, referring to a large crowd of more than 100 people on Michigan Road south of the shooting.Community activists immediately questioned the officer's use of force.Satchel Paige, said the young man " deserved better. We deserve better. I am disgusted, horrified, tired and angry. This is why we need a new use of force policy. It is imperative. We can not hold these killers accountable when the use of force makes it legal."The Facebook Live videoA video circulating on social media shows a Facebook Live recording. More than 2,500 people are watching.A young, shirtless man is recording himself as he drives."You gotta look," he says, as he positions his camera phone to show what's behind the moving car. It appears to be a police car that's tailing him. "It's just one right now," the man says to the camera.It's hard to tell from the video what is happening. But the audio suggests that the engine is beginning to roar to life."Almost lost him y'all!" the man says. "Almost got rid of his ass!"A little while later, the man is laughing and cheering as he thinks he lost the officer. "I'm not going to jail today!" he shouts.Moments later, the man is trying to figure out where he has driven."What street is this? I'm going to park this (expletive) and get the (expletive) out," he says. "At 62nd and Michigan, somebody come get my stupid (expletive)!"He goes on: "Please come get me. Please come get me!"He then appears to park the car and leaves his vehicle. The video, at this point, is unclear. But within 18 seconds, the man is responding to another voice. The man asks: "What'd you say?"About 11 seconds go by when there is more inaudible shouting. Then there's at least one, maybe two, pops. The man appears to either drop his phone, or collapse, or both. He says a cuss word.Then, as the camera points up toward the blue sky, the sounds of more than a dozen other pops ring out.A couple seconds tick away. Then there are two more pops.Keith "Wildstyle" Paschall, a music producer referencing the videos being circulated on social media, was outraged. "As ugly as it is ..the only way we might get justice for him is everyone seeing how he was shot like a dog," Paschall said. Had he not livestreamed the story ...this would be a footnote to everyone's evening."Police said they were aware of the videos on social media but were not prepared to confirm their authenticity.Tiona Reed, 37, who identified herself as the victim's aunt, said through tears that the family had not received any information about what happened."Maybe if they weren't here, we could get some more information,” she said, referring to a large crowd of more than 100 people on Michigan Road south of the shooting.She declined to comment further.A few minutes later, another family member addressed the crowd. She thanked them for their support."I'm just asking you to calm down,” she said. "Be peaceful, please.”The shooting marks at least the fourth involving an IMPD officer this year. Two shootings in February did not result in officers or suspects being struck. Officer Breann Leath was fatally shot at the scene of a domestic disturbance last month.About Us Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Site Map Public Notices Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My Account Support Local BusinessesSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJob Network Cars.com Indianapolis Homes Classifieds Education Moonlighting Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2020 www.indystar.com.
