Appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live Thursday in Los Angeles, President Obama called for the arrest of the "criminals" who shot the two officers in Ferguson. "There's no excuse for criminal acts. Whoever fired those shots shouldn't detract from the issue. They're criminals," Obama said, according to the White House pool report. "They need to be arrested. And then what we need to do is make sure that like-minded, good-spirited people on both sides, law enforcement who have a terrifically tough job, and people who understand they don't want to be stopped and harassed because of their race, that we're able to work together to try and come up with some good answers." Obama also offered his prayers to the wounded officers and their families.

View this video on YouTube youtube.com Belmar said earlier in the day that the unidentified shooter was north or northwest of police, across the street and "embedded" with protesters. Several people in the crowd of protesters, however, said the gunfire did not come from their group and that the shooter was possibly behind them. Though video captured the moment of gunfire, that evidence alone shed little light on the shooting. Forensic firearm expert Rocky Edwards told BuzzFeed News that he could not draw any conclusions on what type of firearm was used or how far it was fired from police due to the quality of the video. Posted at Mar. 12, 2015, at 22:59 PM Multiple news outlets reported three people were detained and questioned in connection to the shooting, but were released without any charges. The three residents told The Guardian they were handcuffed by St. Louis County officers during a dawn raid at their home. Lamont Underwood and Iresha Turner told the newspaper they were at the protest when shots rang out, and fled the area just as many other protestors did. They denied having anything to do with the shooting. The Guardian also identified Martez Little as one of the people detained early Thursday. Turner also said a pistol that was kept in the home's attic for self-defense was taken by officers. "I feel disrespected," Underwood told The Guardian. "I kept telling them I didn't know anything about who shot the cop. Eventually they said they believed me." Posted at Mar. 12, 2015, at 22:51 PM Gov.

I condemn violence against any public safety officials in the strongest terms, and the Department of Justice will never accept any threats or violence directed at those who serve and protect our communities‚Äîfrom this cowardly action, to the killing of an officer in Philadelphia last week while he was buying a game for his son, to the tragic loss of a Deputy U.S. Marshal in the line of duty in Louisiana earlier this week. Such senseless acts of violence threaten the very reforms that nonviolent protesters in Ferguson and around the country have been working towards for the past several months. We wish these injured officers a full and speedy recovery. We stand ready to offer any possible aid to an investigation into this incident, including the department's full range of investigative resources. And we will continue to stand unequivocally against all acts of violence against cops whenever and wherever they occur."

The injuries are not life threatening, according to a statement issued by the St. Louis County Police Department early Thursday. The county police confirmed the shooting to BuzzFeed News in an email early Thursday morning. Chief Jon Belmar later said at a news conference that a 41-year-old officer from St. Louis County was shot in the shoulder. A 32-year-old officer from Webster Groves was shot in the face. Both officers were conscious and being treated for their injuries at a nearby hospital, Belmar said. He did not provide details on their conditions, but added that "those are very serious gunshot injuries." The shootings happened as the officers stood together in front of the Ferguson Police Department on S. Florissant Road. Belmar said at least three shots came from the "north, northwest," across the street. Police did not know Thursday morning who opened fire, but when asked if the shots came from protesters, Belmar replied that "somehow they were embedded in that group of folks." He added that based on the bullet trajectories, the shooter appears to have targeted the police. "These police officers were standing there and they were shot, just because they were police officers," Belmar said. "I would have to make an assumption that these shots were directed exactly at my police officers." The two officers have not been identified. The St. Louis County officer is a 14-year veteran of law enforcement, while the Webster Groves officer is a seven-year veteran. Police previously said the Webster Groves officer was a five-year veteran. Jennifer Arvin, a spokesperson for Barnes-Jewish Hospital, told BuzzFeed News they were treating gunshot victims early Thursday morning, but would not identify them.

Jeff Roberson / AP Jeff Roberson / AP Kate Munsch / Reuters Kate Munsch / Reuters The announcement that Jackson would resign came from Ferguson Mayor James Knowles hours earlier.
