NewsProtesters hope to spur change by marching on Wednesday"If it takes us 365 days for change to come, then we'll be out here for the next year,” one protester said. UPDATE: 10 P.M.: After pausing to listen to speakers on the steps of City Hall, protesters took to the streets again in downtown St. Petersburg Wednesday night. The group of more than 100 chanted, danced and cheered for one another as they walked. They moved into south St. Pete neighborhoods, where they paused to learn more about the history of these areas of town. Carla Bristol pointed out ”that yellow building over there" in the heart of the 22nd Street South business district. It's the Dr. Carter G. Woodson African American Museum. She went on to explain more about this district, and how it was rich was black- and Jewish-owned businesses. Then the interstate was built over it.

"I can't breathe," Scruggs began from the steps of City Hall. "I have not been able to breathe for 50 years and it is time that this city, this county, this state ... and this country recognizes that we are done dying.”She added: "We will not go back to business as usual." The crowd grew louder to show support. Scruggs implored protesters to formally join the NAACP. Between the St. Petersburg and Clearwater area branches, she said she hopes to build a membership of more than 100,000 strong. "Because if you don't have the numbers, you don't control the vote," Scruggs said. "And that's the only thing these folks are counting.”Pastor Frank Peterman Jr., a former Florida state lawmaker and St. Petersburg city council member, also spoke to protesters. "We want to pull down racism in this community, throughout this state and throughout this nation," he said. Then Terron Gland took the mic and started the chant "if we don't get no justice, you don't get no peace.” Everyone started dancing ... "we've got to keep coming to the streets ... we're not getting on no sidewalks. That's never gonna happen.” @TB_Times pic.twitter.com/pMdBsTXX8T— Megan Reeves (@mareevs) June 11, 2020 Last to speak was Terron Gland, an event organizer who has lead protesters across St. Petersburg for more than a week. "We are that generation. We are that generation of obedience," he said into the microphone. "We are that change of the world. And we ain't going to let nobody turn us around. ... Don't let nobody put nothing different in your ear.” Then the group was on the move again, back into the streets of downtown St. Pete. Protests have been a twice-daily occurrence in St. Petersburg, usually beginning in mid-afternoon and reconvening at City Hall in the early evening. There have been no police presence for several days, and protesters no longer gather in front of St. Petersburg Police headquarters. In Tampa, a rally aimed at coming up with demands for Tampa Mayor Jane Castor ended in the early evening. An advocacy group called the Black Collective Movement organized Wednesday night's event. They plan to share a list of demands with the city Thursday. • • •UPDATE 6:30 P.M.: Protesters returned to City Hall in downtown St. Petersburg Wednesday for a second march through the streets.The marched across downtown, stopping in some intersections and passing around a microphone and speaker for people to take turns sharing their message."It is so important we fight the good fight,” said former city councilman and former state lawmaker Frank Peterman Jr. He says this is "about systemic racism,” and that is part of the "very fabric” of American society.Downtown St. Petersburg was quiet, outside of the vibrant energy of the march. Some diners stood and shouted in solidarity as protesters passed by on Central Avenue and later Beach Drive. Others looked on from the windows of their condos and rooftop bars."I am tired. Do you hear me? I am tired. I am so sick of being so sick and tired ... this has got to stop," said Adrienne Reddick, a 55-year-old St. Pete resident who joined the march. "And if we don't stop it, who will? ... I do not want to see this again in my lifetime.”We've stopped in front of the Birchwood. Will Breeze, the super energetic guy from Monday night, is at the mic. He's riffing on a similar speech from Monday: "What if Malcom X stayed home? What if Harriet Tubman stayed home?” pic.twitter.com/Otk9DYcZ9h— Kathryn Varn (@kathrynvarn) June 10, 2020 During a brief pause on Beach Drive, Will Breeze, a familiar speaker in the march, kept the energy level high."What if Malcom X stayed home? What if Harriet Tubman stayed home?”Protesters' second march of the day was purposely shorter than usual. The group planned to return to City Hall around 8 p.m., where local members of the NAACP were expected to speak.• • •UPDATE 4 P.M.: Protesters returned to the downtown streets of St. Petersburg Wednesday afternoon around 2 p.m., despite the 90-plus degree weather and the threat of rain in the forecast.The plan was to march the streets into the Old Northeast neighborhood and loop back to City Hall, where the event began.
