Saturday in response to an escalating nationwide debate over monuments honoring the Confederacy. The marchers were met by much larger group of counter-demonstrators, many of them believed to be associated with the nationwide "Black Lives Matter” movement that has erupted amid a rash of police brutality incidents targeting African-Americans.

Mild scuffles were reported on social media including one at the city's Union Station in which activists labeled the Southern Heritage demonstrators members of the Ku Klux Klan, a hate group with roots dating back to the mid-1800s.

The group's Facebook page showed a small group of Confederate flag wavers passing near Capitol Hill, and according to some estimates only about 50 people showed up. At one point the Southern Heritage protestors were so overmatched that security reportedly had to push counter demonstrators back.

"It's white genocide propaganda. They're pushing folks to shoot cops and white people.”The event comes in the wake of the June 17 mass murder of nine African-American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, allegedly by an avowed white supremacist who waved the Confederate flag as a symbol of racist hatred in a host of images he posted on a website. Since the mass shooting, state and local governments as well as public universities have been pressured to remove symbols of the Confederacy, including the Confederate battle flag and statues of Confederate war leaders.
