Presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden delivered a televised speech to the nation at City Hall in the morning, then won the postponed Pennsylvania primary later in the evening. In a stark contrast to the chaos of the previous three days, protesters chanted and sang and even dribbled basketballs around City Hall, in Old City, in West Philadelphia, and near a police station in Fishtown, where an ad hoc group armed with baseball bats had appeared the day before. Some protesters and police shook hands and knelt together. Protests on the Main Line, in Cherry Hill, and at the Shore also were peaceful, as was a march on 52nd Street in West Philadelphia. At least one person was arrested late Tuesday afternoon in Philadelphia, and police reported 703 arrests since widespread protests and looting erupted in the city on Saturday.

The incident happened during a march past 10th and Market Streets late Tuesday afternoon. The woman tapped the officer's bike with her right foot as they passed, according to video provided by a person at the march. The officer responded by grabbing the woman's hoodie and confronting her about touching his bike. She responded with profanity and the officer tackled her. Other police made a ring around the arrest with their bicycles. Police did not respond to questions about what the woman was charged with, or the tackle the officer involved used to take her into custody. The officer was not identified.

The protesters knelt and chanted for the troopers to "take a knee” and shouting George Floyd's name. The troopers remained standing, and after a half-hour standoff, most of the protesters left, yelling, "You had your chance! Peace starts with you!” TOM GRALISH / Staff Photographer Protesters take a knee and chant while New Jersey State Police guard the Cherry Hill Mall. The troopers did not join them on a knee, but eventually left on a bus after most of the protesters had departed. Among a handful of protesters who remained, Shakeeya Summers, 35, of Cherry Hill shouted at the line of troopers, "My baby said, 'Momma, I don't want to be black no more.'” After another half hour, the troopers marched away, and left on a bus, and Karen Cutts, 51, of Haddon Heights approached Summers' 6-year old son, Gregory James, and, after asking permission, told him, "You are loved. Your life matters.” Cutts then went to Sunmers, crying, "I am so sorry, I am so sorry you have to go through all this. It's not fair. It's not fair at all.” Cutts, who is white, then hugged Summer, who is black, and continued, "My heart breaks for you and every other mother. I know you've been suffering for so long and it needs to stop.” Two moms meet after a peaceful protest march that ended at the Cherry Hill Mall.

She had been leading protesters through the megaphone on the march, and two came up to compliment her afterward for keeping their spirits and energy high. She hadn't organized the protest. "I'm just a black woman upset,” she said. Protesters had worked throughout the march to keep each other safe, urging each other to stay together and avoid engaging police. She said she wanted to bring attention to the voiceless during an hours-long march that wound through Center City and West Philly. "I'm not down for the rioting,” she said, though she added stolen Nikes were less precious than a stolen life. "The rest of society [needs to] know we're not here for a ruckus, not here to break things. We're here to cause attention, and justice for those who can't speak for themselves.” She was exhausted after walking miles for hours on Tuesday. But the day had been "a beautiful moment.” "We need to have a beautiful ending,” she said, and turned for home. — Aubrey Whelan Share Shares Facebook Twitter 8:23 PM - June 2, 2020 8:23 PM - 06/2/20 8:23 PM - June 2, 2020 Facebook Twitter DAVID MAIALETTI / Staff Photographer Officer Quishanna Lee (left) kneels with a group of protesters in the intersection Frankford Ave and Crease Street in Fishtown in Philadelphia, Pa. on June 2, 2020.

Monday is the third day of protests about the police involved death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. A day after the Philadelphia Police Department used tear gas against protesters who had gathered on Interstate 676, Commissioner Danielle Outlaw told the 6,500 members of her department in an email that all uses of force must be reported via police radio, in addition to a written report after the fact, "to ensure we can properly defend our actions when we are ultimately challenged.” The email, sent Tuesday and obtained by The Inquirer, also encourages officers to "be diligent in collecting any evidence that supports our actions, as well as successful prosecutions going forward.” Outlaw's message, first reported by WHYY, comes as some elected officials questioned the department's approach in handling the hundreds of demonstrators who breached the active highway a day earlier. In her email, the commissioner — who defended the use of tear gas at a news conference earlier Tuesday — called that decision "deliberate and deemed necessary for safety for both officers and those protesters who swarmed the interstate highway.” In addition, Outlaw instructed her officers to grant reporters "reasonable access” during the ongoing unrest and ensuing curfews. At least four journalists — from The Inquirer, WHYY, and two from the Wilmington News-Journal — have been taken into custody during the demonstrations. "Please remember,” Outlaw wrote, "the press are not only entitled to access, they have a right to it.” — Chris Palmer Share Shares Facebook Twitter 7:50 PM - June 2, 2020 7:50 PM - 06/2/20 7:50 PM - June 2, 2020 Facebook Twitter Ben Franklin Bridge reopens to traffic The Ben Franklin Bridge has been reopened after being closed for about an hour while protesters marched in Center City.

Protest chants and raised fists continued, as did the relative calm of the demonstration. There were brief moments of tension during the all-afternoon march, with least one person being detained by police. It was unclear what the person was being detained for, and protesters decried police and questioned the arrest. Energy seemed to be waning, though, as the group crossed the Schuylkill and the city's 8:30 p.m. curfew neared, and the crowd began thinning.

"Protesting is not a crime. We are not going to charge you for protesting,” he said. But, he added, "if we see vigilante-type behavior, beating people up, if we see crimes or the illegal possession of guns ... we are going to charge and prosecute that.” He said his office was investigating multiple reports of terroristic threats and two separate beatings that took place in Fishtown yesterday, as well as reports of people with guns at the Target in South Philadelphia. He said almost all arrests in connection with the protests had been summary citations that do not involve the DA's office. Police have brought him about 200 cases of felonies including burglary related to looting, but no arson charges as of Tuesday despite the numerous fires set around the city. Krasner said that most people who were charged in connection with looting were 18 to 23, and surprisingly had no criminal record.

"I'm here because my people are oppressed,” he said. He had attended the protest on 676 the day before, where cops sprayed tear gas and pepper spray and protesters were trapped against a fence. It made him even more determined to attend Tuesday's peaceful protest. "If you want to see change, you have to be uncomfortable.” he said. There were moments of joy in the march, too, like the dancing outside City Hall. Nsaih and his twin brother Damion, also a finance student, saw two high school classmates in the crowd that they hadn't seen in years. "Congratulations on graduating!” they yelled to each other, grinning behind their masks. "This is healing for a lot of people, too,” Nsaih said.

"To the thousands of New Jerseyans that assembled peacefully this week let me be clear: we hear you, we see you, we respect you, we share your anger and we share your commitment to change,” Grewal said during a news conference alongside Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy. At least 43 other states require some licensing requirement for officers, Grewal said, adding he wants to bring law enforcement inline with other professions that require licensing, like doctors and lawyers. » READ MORE: N.J. to overhaul police use-of-force guidelines, attorney general says — Associated Press Share Shares Facebook Twitter 5:20 PM - June 2, 2020 5:20 PM - 06/2/20 5:20 PM - June 2, 2020 Facebook Twitter Marchers take a knee at Broad and South A group of at least a 1,000 people that had stopped in Rittenhouse Square moved east, stretching along five city blocks.

Several dozen people were also mulling around, some additional protesters and others residents watching. A heavy police presence filled Girard Avenue, which was shut down to traffic in the area. Mayor Jim Kenney and Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw condemned vigilantism Tuesday and the mayor criticized the police response, which allowed the men Monday to roam the streets armed with baseball bats and hammers for two-and-a-half hours past the citywide 6 p.m. curfew.

The officials spoke out against the city's response to the George Floyd protests. When the unrest following George Floyd's death engulfed Philadelphia, city leaders scrambled to assemble press conferences in which diverse groups of politicians, law enforcement officials and clergy members implored demonstrators to stop looting and damaging property. State Rep. Jordan Harris (D, Phila.) was invited to some of those events, but he chose not to participate until he could present the protesters with a plan for action. "It can't just be about telling people to go home,” said Harris, who chairs the Pennsylvania Legislative Black Caucus. "We understand that part. But we also have to give solutions so that all of the things that have been happening in our community stop happening.” On Tuesday, Harris and about a dozen other Philadelphia elected officials, all but one of whom are African American, unveiled a detailed plan for reforming policing. The group called on Council to pass an ordinance requiring citizen input on contract negotiations with the police union, which are usually held behind closed doors and have produced strong protections for officers accused of wrongdoing. They want Gov. Tom Wolf to create a deputy inspector general position dedicated to rooting out waste, fraud and abuse in law enforcement agencies. And they want Mayor Jim Kenney to end stop-and-frisk tactics, among other measures. The group included Reps. Chris Rabb, Joanna McClinton, Malcolm Kenyatta and Kevin Boyle, and Councilmembers Isaiah Thomas, Kathy Gilmore Richardson and Kenyatta Johnson. City Councilmember Kendra Brooks, who with Harris helped organize the event, said she also did not feel comfortable calling for the protesters to stand down without offering them a concrete plan.

Monday is the third day of protests about the police involved death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Mayor Jim Kenney and Police Commissioner Danielle Outlaw defended the use of tear gas Monday evening against protesters on I-676, saying it was a "last resort” employed by officers in a dangerous situation. "The option of deploying tear gas was selected when it became evident at that time that other options were not effective,” Outlaw said Tuesday, noting the incident will be reviewed like all uses of force by police. She and Kenney said the action was used after protesters surrounded a state trooper's car and threw rocks at officers. "We monitored the entire march,” Kenney said, "and it was a peaceful, legal protest and there was no issue. At some point in time, a group broke off from the main group and decided to take the highway, which as the commissioner said is a dangerous situation.” Kenney said the police response was affected because protest groups did not tell city officials where they planned to march. "The other issue is: How do you clear people off the highway?” he said. "Do you use physical force? Do you wade in with batons? No, that's not good either.” He and Outlaw said they were working in a chaotic situation that could've been dangerous to protesters and motorists. During recent protests, the mayor said officers have been hurt, soaked with water guns of bleach, pelted with bricks, and burned by chemicals. "I'm not saying that that's tit for tat,” Kenney said, "but all I'm saying is in order for us to get this group somewhere else, other than where they were, that was employed and then they moved.” "Listen, I hate this entire thing,” he added. "I wish none of this ever started and we're stuck with the issue of every day something happens we may not be prepared for.” The commissioner said tear gas has a dual-purpose: "to disperse and also to make arrests afterward.” But "I'm not going to Monday morning quarterback” the decision, she said, reiterating a thorough investigation would be conducted. That investigation will examine not only the responding officers' actions, she said, but also the supervision they received during that time. » READ MORE: Philadelphia protesters gassed on I-676, leading to 'pandemonium' as they tried to flee — Erin McCarthy Share Shares Facebook Twitter 12:47 PM - June 2, 2020 12:47 PM - 06/2/20 12:47 PM - June 2, 2020 Facebook Twitter Kenney condemns armed vigilantes in Fishtown, criticizes cops who took photos with them DAVID MAIALETTI / Staff Photographer A group, who called themselves old-time Fishtowners, walk on Girard Avenue carrying bats, hammers and shovels in Philadelphia, Pa. on June 1, 2020.

MORENO / Staff Photographer Upper Darby Police block 69th street near the Tower Theater, during a press conference by city officials speaking about the looting damage and steps to move forward in the town of Upper Darby. Monday, June 1, 2020. The protests in Philadelphia over the killing of George Floyd spilled into the suburbs closest to the city, with some businesses looted and damaged. Officials in Delaware County issued a disaster emergency declaration late Monday in response to looting that damaged Upper Darby's business corridor over the weekend. Several shops along 69th Street were heavily vandalized as heated protests in West Philadelphia over the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis spilled over the county line. Police Superintendent Timothy Berhardt said Monday that several hundred people looted for more than 10 hours along 69th Street from Ludlow to Walnut Streets, beginning around 4 p.m. Sunday. The declaration, signed by County Council Chairman Brin Zidek, will expedite applications for state assistance for business owners and residents affected by the looting. It will last for seven days, officials said Tuesday. "This does something for all of Delaware County's residents,” Zidek said Tuesday. "By and large, it gives us a greater opportunity to have expenses that occur during civil unrest reimburse through [the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Association.]” The declaration also temporarily suspends the normal process for hiring employees and making purchases at the county level as a result of the cleanup efforts following the looting. "There were peaceful demonstrations that took place in Upper Darby and some not peaceful things that took place, and one shouldn't conflate the two,” Zidek said. "We are calling, as we have before, for people to exercise their right to free speech and protest in a peaceful manner. "Looting and rioting is not productive,” he added. "It does not help us heal, and it doesn't help us to move forward and develop solutions to underlying issues.” Business owners on Monday complained that the response to the looters in Upper Darby was slow, and wondered why police didn't do more immediately. Bernhardt, the police superintendent, said Monday that Upper Darby planned all week in anticipation of "some type of situation.” Officers were stationed on 69th Street when the looting began and more came as it went on. He said the department's approach was not to incite more violence or make as many arrests as possible. It was to keep civilians and officers safe and move the crowd along. "We found it difficult to deploy officers to different locations for looting that was taking place. We didn't want to give up the base and the area where we were secured,” he said. "So we just moved everyone along and, like I said, we made those arrests.” District Attorney Jack Stollsteimer said if officers had not methodically moved up 69th Street to regain control of it, people could have been hurt. "Getting people arrested and getting them charged was not the number one priority last night,” he said. "The number one priority last night was to protect the people who were here, stuck in this madness and this chaos.” » READ MORE: Philly's chaotic weekend of protests spread to the suburbs.

During the curfew, people are only allowed to leave their home to work at essential businesses, seek medical attention, or seek police assistance. — Rob Tornoe Share Shares Facebook Twitter 10:20 AM - June 2, 2020 10:20 AM - 06/2/20 10:20 AM - June 2, 2020 Facebook Twitter 'A country is crying out for leadership': Biden calls for unity, healing in Philly following nationwide protests Matt Rourke / AP Democratic presidential candidate, former Vice President Joe Biden speaks in Philadelphia, Tuesday, June 2, 2020. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) Former Vice President Joe Biden called protests in Philadelphia and across the nation "a wake-up call for our nation” and repeated the words uttered by George Floyd before he was killed while pinned down by Minneapolis officers: "I can't breathe.” "It's not the first time we've heard those words,” Biden said Monday morning at City Hall, referencing the death of Eric Garner in 2014. "But it's time to listen to those words. To try and understand them. To respond to them. Respond with action.” "A country is crying out for leadership,” Biden added. "Leadership that can unite us, leadership that brings us together. Leadership that can recognize pain and the grief of communities that have had a knee on their neck for a long time." During his speech, delivered following a third night of protests in Philadelphia, Biden called out looters that have ransacked cities following demonstrations against police brutality. But he also pointed the finger at police officers, who at times have "escalated tension” amid otherwise peaceful demonstrations. "We need to distinguish between legitimize peaceful protest and opportunistic violent destruction,” Biden said. Biden also criticized President Trump for dispersing peaceful protesters outside the White House on Monday evening prior to the city's curfew to make way for a photo opportunity at a church across the street. "When peaceful protesters are dispersed by the order for a president, from the doorstep of the people's house, the White House — using tear gas and flash grenades — in order to stage a photo op at one of the most historic churches in the country ... we can be forgiven for believing that the president is more interested in power than in principle,” Biden said. "'I can't breathe. I can't breathe.' George Floyd's last words, but they didn't die with him," Joe Biden says."They're still being heard echoing all across this nation. They speak to a nation where too often just the color of your skin puts your life at risk," the fmr. VP adds. pic.twitter.com/fu3EPBlndU— CNN (@CNN) June 2, 2020 — Rob Tornoe Share Shares Facebook Twitter 10:15 AM - June 2, 2020 10:15 AM - 06/2/20 10:15 AM - June 2, 2020 Facebook Twitter Police: Man killed after trying to blow up ATM machine near Olde Kensington DAVID MAIALETTI / Staff Photographer A member of the Philadelphia bomb squad surveys the scene after an ATM machine was blown-up at 2207 N. 2nd Street in Philadelphia, Pa. on June 2, 2020. A man died Tuesday morning after trying to blow up an ATM machine near Olde Kensington, the Philadelphia Police said. Around 6:15 a.m., police found a 24-year-old with trauma to his upper body. They said the man was "attempting to break into an ATM with explosives,” which were recovered at the scene. He was transported to Temple University Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead, police said. The Philadelphia bomb squad and the ATF could be seen investigating the scene, photographing and collecting evidence around the mangled, blown-out machine outside Sidekicks Sports Bar at 2207 N. 2nd Street. The ATM was a stand-alone machine on the sidewalk, not connected to a bank. The news comes amid numerous reports of recent ATM explosions throughout the city. Unrest continues this week amid protests of the death of George Floyd, who was killed at the hands of Minneapolis police. Another ATM appeared on Monday to have exploded at Front Street and Allegheny Avenue in Fairhill. — Erin McCarthy Share Shares Facebook Twitter 9:30 AM - June 2, 2020 9:30 AM - 06/2/20 9:30 AM - June 2, 2020 Facebook Twitter Police: 263 more people arrested since Monday afternoon JESSICA GRIFFIN / Staff Photographer A person is arrested near Broad and Spring Garden Streets, in Philadelphia, June 01, 2020. Monday is the third day of protests about the police involved death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Philadelphia Police said Tuesday that an additional 263 people had been arrested since Monday afternoon over the ongoing demonstrations in the city — nearly all of whom were cited for either failure to disperse or violating curfew. The update to the ongoing arrest tally, last provided Monday afternoon, represents the largest single jump in reported arrests since the unrest began Saturday, though police did not say how or when they occurred — or specify how many related to a chaotic scene on I-676, when police tear gassed hundreds of people who had marched onto the highway. Of the 263 new cases, police said, 219 were citations. Since the demonstrations began Saturday, citations have accounted for 70% of the arrests made by police. In addition, police said 186 people have been charged with looting or burglary, 10 with assault on police, four for theft, three for firearms violations, and one each for rioting, propulsion of a missile, and vandalism. — Chris Palmer Share Shares Facebook Twitter 9:00 AM - June 2, 2020 9:00 AM - 06/2/20 9:00 AM - June 2, 2020 Facebook Twitter Pulitzer Prize-winning Inquirer reporter arrested by police Kristen A. Graham Inquirer reporter was arrested June 1 after covering protests in Center City. She was handcuffed and taken into custody for being out past curfew despite having an essential employee exemption, displaying her press pass prominently and telling officers she was a reporter. Kristen Graham, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for the Philadelphia Inquirer, was arrested by police while covering protests near City Hall Monday night and placed in a police bus. Here's how Graham described her arrest: As calmly as I could manage, I told them I was a reporter, nodding at my press pass. Journalists are considered essential employees, permitted to be out past curfew if they're working, and I reminded the officers of that. They fitted flexible handcuffs that felt like oversized zip-ties to my wrists anyway. The officers led me by both arms to a waiting bus. I was the first inside; more than 20 women joined me eventually; one crying as she was led in. Multiple people, including a journalist from the Wilmington News-Journal, said they were also walking or riding home when they were detained. Graham, who has worked at the Inquirer for nearly 20 years, wrote that eventually, a lawyer for the Inquirer made contact with city officials. Soon after the call, an officer let her and the other journalist off the bus. I was shell-shocked. I still am. I am a born and bred Philadelphian, an Inquirer journalist for the past two decades. I've covered shootings and protests, fires and funerals, calamities of all kinds, but I've never experienced anything quite like what I saw Monday. I'm still not sure how to explain it to my children. » READ MORE: Tear gas, then handcuffs: I am an Inquirer journalist who was arrested for doing my job — Rob Tornoe Share Shares Facebook Twitter 8:00 AM - June 2, 2020 8:00 AM - 06/2/20 8:00 AM - June 2, 2020 Facebook Twitter 'I was welcomed with open arms': Camden police chief on marching alongside peaceful protesters April Saul / AP Camden County Metro Police Chief Joe Wysocki raises a fist while marching with Camden residents and activists in Camden, N.J., on Saturday to protest the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. (April Saul via AP) As police and protesters faced off in tense confrontations in Philadelphia and other cities across the country, cops in Camden took a different tact — they marched alongside demonstrators. Speaking on CNN Tuesday morning, Camden Police Chief Joe Wysocki said when he found out members of the community wanted to hold a peaceful march over the weekend, he asked for permission to march with them. "I was welcomed with open arms,” Wysocki said. He and his officers locked arms with protesters and joined the march against police brutality and the killing of George Floyd. "What happened in Minnesota is absolutely horrific, and it bothers every good cop in the country,” Wysocki said. "There's a knot in everyone's stomach, every cop in the country. We had to do that.” "The community chose not to have a violent protest, and the community wants a safer place. That's the key ingredient,” Wysocki added. » READ MORE: In Camden, police and protesters take a different path after George Floyd's killing — Rob Tornoe Share Shares Facebook Twitter 7:00 AM - June 2, 2020 7:00 AM - 06/2/20 7:00 AM - June 2, 2020 Facebook Twitter Polls open for unprecedented primary election, with 77% of Philadelphia's polling places closed YONG KIM / Staff Photographer A voter prepares to drop off their ballot into a ballot drop box at the south portal of City Hall on Thursday, May 28, 2020. Pennsylvanians are voting Tuesday in an atmosphere with few precedents — if any. On top of a pandemic that had already scrambled elections across the country, the vote will come after days of protests over the killing of George Floyd as Minneapolis police knelt on his neck and violent clashes that have added more tension — and left an already stricken Philadelphia smoldering in places. First the primary was shifted five weeks forward from April 28 due to the coronavirus pandemic. Then the Democratic contest for president effectively ended, with Joe Biden's victory all but assured. Almost two million Pennsylvanians have requested mail-in ballots. And 77% of Philadelphia's polling places won't be open on primary day. It all means it could be days before we have actual results. » READ MORE: Follow our live election coverage throughout the day. — Laura McCrystal, Jonathan Tamari, and Jonathan Lai Share Shares Facebook Twitter 6:30 AM - June 2, 2020 6:30 AM - 06/2/20 6:30 AM - June 2, 2020 Facebook Twitter South Philly gun store owner shoots and kills potential looter ALEJANDRO A. ALVAREZ / Staff Photographer Philadelphia police investigate a report of gun shop owner Firing Line on Front at Greenwich St. on Tuesday morning June 2, 2020. The owner of a gun store in South Philadelphia shot and killed a potential looter who broke in early Tuesday morning. A group of three or four people cut the lock and kicked in the door at Firing Line, Inc. on the 1500 block of South Front Street, police told reporters. The owner, who told police he was spending the night in the shop due to previous break-in attempts, said he heard the individuals walking up the steps to his second floor store and took matters into his own hands. "He heard them walking up the steps, and one of the individuals who broke into the property pointed a handgun at him,” Philadelphia police inspector Scott Small told Fox 29. "And that's when the store owner fired his own weapon, striking the one perpetrator at least one time in the head.” Medics pronounced the person dead on the scene, and the other two or three individuals fled on foot, Small said. Small said an individual arrived at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital with a gunshot wound to his shoulder shortly after the incident, and said it's a "possibility” the person is connected to the burglary attempt. Police did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ALEJANDRO A.

Hundreds of National Guard troops rolled into Philadelphia to help restore order Monday, even as new and frightening confrontations erupted between police and protesters on a third straight day of unrest. Fires burned again, and the city remained under curfew following looting and destruction that overtook peaceful demonstrations sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police. A tired Mayor Jim Kenney declared that Philadelphia is "in the middle of one of the biggest crises in the city's history,” simultaneously beset by civil unrest, a pandemic, economic devastation, and a primary election. On Monday evening, thousands of marchers moved onto the Vine Street Expressway, stopping traffic on the city's major east-west thoroughfare. Some lay in the street. Police fired tear gas into the crowd, setting off a blind, chaotic stampede as demonstrators tried to escape, scrambling up walls and steep hills and falling over one another. "Tear gas! Tear gas!” people shouted as they ran and fell, many digging their hands into the dirt to pull themselves forward. » READ MORE: National Guard troops deploy in Philly as confrontations continue between police and protesters — Jeff Gammage, Ellie Rushing and Kristen A.
