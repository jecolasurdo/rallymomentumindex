Here are the players who protested in Week 7:Denver Broncos: Linebacker Brandon Marshall took a knee during the national anthem before Monday night's game against the Texans. He has taken a knee during the anthem for all seven of the Broncos' games. -- Jeff LegwoldSeattle Seahawks: The Seahawks linked arms and stood as a demonstration of unity during the national anthem before their game against the Cardinals on Sunday night. They have done so before every game this season. -- Sheil KapadiaSan Francisco 49ers: Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, making his second start of the season, knelt during the national anthem before the 49ers' matchup with the Bucs. Kaepernick was again joined by linebacker Eli Harold and safety Eric Reid in taking a knee. Safeties Jaquiski Tartt and Antoine Bethea and cornerbacks Keith Reaser and Rashard Robinson once again raised their right fists as the anthem played. -- Nick WagonerMiami Dolphins: Running back Arian Foster, wide receiver Kenny Stills and safety Michael Thomas knelt for the anthem before the Dolphins' game against the Bills. They've done so for every game this season. Foster said in September that the main purpose of their demonstration is to create a healthy dialogue on systemic racial issues, such as education, the prison system and police brutality toward minorities. In turn, Foster added, productive conversations could help lead to change. "It's just so easy to hate," he said. "If you're proclaiming to be a true American, freedom runs in our bloodlines, right? It's supposed to. If somebody is telling you they don't feel like they're free, why wouldn't you listen to them?" -- James WalkerTennessee Titans: After the national anthem before the Titans' game against the Colts, cornerback Jason McCourty, linebacker Wesley Woodyard and defensive linemen Jurrell Casey and DaQuan Jones all raised a fist, as they have done this season. For the first time, however, defensive tackle Al Woods and cornerback Perrish Cox joined them. -- Paul KuharskyPhiladelphia Eagles: Safety Malcolm Jenkins and cornerback Ron Brooks each raised a fist over his head during the national anthem before their game against the Vikings. Both players have been doing so since Week 2 against the Bears. -- Tim McManusLos Angeles Rams: Defensive end Robert Quinn raised his right fist during the national anthem before the Rams' game in London against the Giants. He has been doing that since Week 1. He explained his stance in early September. "Just standing up for my rights," he said. "I didn't want to try to distract the team; just want to have my right of freedom." -- Alden Gonzalez FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmail
