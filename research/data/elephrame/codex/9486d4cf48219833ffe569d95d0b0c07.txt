Taylor, a Louisville EMT, was shot and killed by three plainclothes police officers executing a 'no-knock warrant' in March. Police shot her eight times. She would have been 27 years old Friday. Hundreds of people attended the vigil. They prayed, listened and clapped along to songs of hope and perseverance. At times celebratory, at others somber, the vigil's mood captured the grievances but left behind the agitation of what has gripped the country in the aftermath of George Floyd's death. The vigil began at 8 p.m. and continued well after darkness fell. People began to disperse peacefully around 10:15 p.m. The crowd singing along and clapping to Freedom @FOX19 pic.twitter.com/pnchspZyJ1— Courtney King (@Fox19CourtKing) June 6, 2020 The crowd singing along and clapping to Freedom @FOX19 pic.twitter.com/pnchspZyJ1— Courtney King (@Fox19CourtKing) June 6, 2020 A few hundred people are at Washington Park where a vigil for Breonna Taylor's birthday is going to take place @FOX19 pic.twitter.com/MNGlhA0Nbl— Courtney King (@Fox19CourtKing) June 6, 2020 Copyright 2020 WXIX.
