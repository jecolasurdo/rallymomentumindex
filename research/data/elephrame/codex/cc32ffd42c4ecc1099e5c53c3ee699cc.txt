Protestors marched from the Spire on O'Connell Street to the US Embassy in Ballsbridge, chanting: "Black lives matter, no justice no peace.” Upon arrival at the embassy, a minute's silence was observed. US protests began in Minneapolis on Monday, triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who pleaded for air as a police officer pressed a knee into his neck in Minneapolis. Protests have been echoed around the world as people decry years of deaths of black people at police hands. Derek Chauvin, the police officer who pressed his knee on to Floyd's neck has been charged with murder.

Among the thousands marching in today's peaceful protest was Solidarity – People Before Profit TD Bríd Smith. "This is the most powerful and youngest protest I have been in since the death of Savita Halappanavar,” Smith told TheJournal.ie. "It's spontaneous, peaceful and united against institutional racism. People want change, they want to stand in solidarity with African Americans – and are shouting George Floyd's name repeatedly. "Young people are fed up with racism, it's everywhere. Black lives matter.” Fine Gael Councillor James Geoghegan has asked the Lord Mayor of Dublin to open an online book of condolences for George Floyd. "I feel this would be a way for people who could not participate in today's protest because of Covid-19 restrictions or concerns to have their voices heard and express solidarity,” the councillor for Dublin Bay South said. #Open journalism No news is bad news Support The Journal Your contributions will help us continue to deliver the stories that are important to you Support us now It is understood that this proposal is being considered by the Mansion House.

The abrupt decision by the agents underscored the rattled mood inside the White House, where the chants from protesters in Lafayette Park could be heard all weekend and Secret Service agents and law enforcement officers struggled to contain the crowds.
