The first-year coach wasn't giving his team some final instructions before facing one of the Midwest Classic's top teams. It was the reaction some in the crowd had after all his players took a knee during the national anthem that he felt needed to be addressed."I said, 'Guys, when you take these type of actions as far as the protest, just know why you're doing it and when you're doing it, have tough skin because you will have everyone clawing for you,' ” he said Friday.The football players at HOPE are among the growing number of athletes nationwide who have staged some type of silent protest during the national anthem in order to bring attention to racial and social inequality.For the Hawks, the process has evolved. What started with players taking a knee against St. Francis went to taking a knee and sharing a prayer with the players from SWCHA (Southeast Wisconsin Christian Homeschool Athletics). Last Saturday the Hawks prayed and then locked arms with the Lake Country Lutheran players as they stood during the national anthem.HOPE plays at St. John's Northwestern Military Academy at 2 p.m. Saturday."It was more of a situation about unity and after talking with the guys, it's a little bit more than unity, it's about equality,” Jordan said. "However they feel to protest it, whether it's locking arms, taking a knee, it's up to them. I don't know exactly what they have in store, but I'm 100% behind them.”HOPE Christian is a school of about 300 students located at Martin Luther King Drive and Auer Ave. that is well-known for the high percentage of its graduates who are accepted into college. Its website boasts that 100% of its students have been accepted into college the past five years.Its athletic history and facilities are much more modest. The football team practices at Clinton Rose Park on a field that isn't marked and lacks goal posts. The team, which features a number of first-year players, has lost 16 of its last 17 games if you count its forfeit victory over Kenosha Christian Life on Sept. 24.It was a 36-6 loss at Living Word Lutheran on Sept. 10 that sparked the players' desire to protest. The players and coaches felt they weren't being treated fairly by the officials and there was growing tension between the teams on the field.The situation reached the point that Jordan decided it was not in "our best interest” to finish the game, so they didn't. The following Monday the team watched some of the Jackie Robinson movie instead of reviewing the game."I just felt like there needed to be some change because here you still see problems,” said Marquis Hubanks, a sophomore halfback/linebacker. ”You move around the world and you see there isn't that much equality. We don't get treated the same as everyone else. I just don't think its right.”Senior Rashard Wheeler, an offensive tackle and defensive end, said the team's protest was initially misunderstood by some, who thought the team was just blindly following what players in the NFL are doing.The team and the school shared their position in a full-page ad that ran Friday in the Journal Sentinel. It read in part: "We want equality for a peaceful society and chose this form of protest to shine a spotlight on it ""Everyone thought we were doing it for the wrong reasons,” Wheeler said. "Now everyone sees we're doing it for equality and peace and for everyone to come together so there is no violence.”Before the Lake Country Lutheran game, players from both teams gathered in a circle at midfield for a pregame prayer. They stood and locked arms for the national anthem.The HOPE Christian Hawks were not alone."What we're trying to show is equality and unity. (That is) what we're trying to get at,” Hubanks said. "We're not just saying this to say it, we're trying to make things happen. Them coming together with us, I show love to them for that. Them helping this movement is actually something great. I respect them for that.”CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREFind JobsShare your feedback to help improve our site experience!
