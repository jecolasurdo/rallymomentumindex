Chris Christie, as well as local control of the city's school board, now made up of state-appointed members led by a state-appointed superintendent.RELATED: District forming committee for new Camden High"We know the decisions that are being made right now are not the decisions that are made with the community," said Vida Neil, a 55-year-old Camden resident and niece of the city's former administrator,Ted Hinson. "They don't come to the community, they don't ask us nothing. They make the decisions and then they tell us this is what we have to accept."But on this day," she boomed into the microphone, "things are going to change."Though it was over within 30 minutes, the "People's Conference" marked the emergence of millennial-led organized activism in Camden. April Grant, a 29-year-old Camden resident, and Elizabeth Parris, a 30-year-old Camden transplant, began reaching out to local residents in August to launch a local chapter of Black Lives Matter. The college friends said their work is backed by the New Jersey chapter of Black Lives Matter and mentors elsewhere in the state.The two women used their Facebook networks to start holding face-to-face meetings with outspoken residents. Their Black Lives Matter-NJ CAMDEN Facebook page now has 73 members; about 20 are deeply involved in its work. Though led by young people, the chapter's ranks include older members like Neil.Not everything in Camden is "rays and sunshine," Grant said. "There are a lot of issues affecting families that aren't being addressed completely."Parris marched in student rallies in Philadelphia after the deaths of Trayvon Martin and Michael Brown. After moving to Camden, the medical student said she felt a personal responsibility to advocate for her new community."We're just two people who can't quite sit down and rest on our privilege," Parris said. "If I make it somewhere, it means nothing; if I turn to my left or right and I see a colleague or peer who can't also do well for themselves, it's lost."Buy PhotoVida Neil (left) and MoNeke Ragsdale (center) are the among the first Camden residents to join the local chapter of Black Lives Matter. The group held its first rally on Tuesday outside a school board meeting in Camden. "We want our demands to be heard," Neil said. (Photo: Kim Mulford/Staff photographer)Grating under what they view as outsiders controlling their city, the group's members complained about lead levels in schools' water supply, the city's gentrifying center, the lack of local job opportunities, and the city's dismantled police force.MoNeke Ragsdale, president of the Camden High School Parent Teacher Organization, said she has met frequently with the group since August. Ragsdale lost her bid for the Democratic primary nomination in the Camden County freeholder race earlier this year. She opposes the planned demolition of Camden High School and worries about the future of its programs.She was intrigued by the idea of a local chapter of Black Lives Matter, noting "Camden's issues are a little bit different than national issues.""I like the youthness of it," said Ragsdale, a lifelong city resident. "It's very, very powerful energy, drive and commitment. ... They're really excited."Keith Benson, a Camden High School teacher, has complained often about the lack of local control over Camden's schools. He is among the group's early members."I think it's an opportunity for more attention to be focused on the issues that people have been talking and complaining about for decades," Benson said. "The more people you have bringing attention to issues, the harder it is to ignore. The fact that they're here in Camden and taking up the struggle of our community matters a whole lot to me."Neil, a 42-year resident of Camden, welcomed the opportunity to lift her voice on the group's microphone. The city needs something new, she told a reporter a few hours before the rally began."People in Camden have been told the untruths so much, it's hard for them to believe the truth," Neil observed. "All of our politicians, they don't work for us. They work against us. We haven't had a politician in the last 30 years that did anything the people wanted them to do, from state government on down to your local politicians. The people are not a factor. After a while, you start feeling that.""We want our demands to be heard," she said. "We're going to stay on those issues until they are heard."The group's next rally will be held outside Camden High School's homecoming football game at 1 p.m. on Saturday. It coincides with the National Day of Protest to Stop Police Brutality.Kim Mulford: (856) 486-2448; kmulford@gannettnj.comDon't miss a thing Download our apps and get alerts for local news, crime, weather, traffic and more.
