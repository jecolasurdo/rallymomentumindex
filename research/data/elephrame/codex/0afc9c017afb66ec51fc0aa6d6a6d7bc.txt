The protesters are opposed to a police contract the council had passed.And, she said, they got Hales' attention."We wanted to make a statement," she said. "We don't have to stay here a week."Hales wasn't seen at his home since the encampment began Friday night. Protesters said they heard he was staying in a hotel.Through an email from his spokesman, Hales said he respected the group's right to protest on Saturday evening."I have great respect and empathy for people exercising their right to free speech," he said.Original post continues below:Protesters camped outside Mayor Charlie Hales' house were plotting their next move Saturday morning, having endured torrential rain Friday and as heavy winds moved in for the afternoon.About 25 tents were pitched along the Eastmoreland street, and some protesters slept in cars parked nearby. Organizers say about 70 people remained at midnight Saturday."The rain yesterday was pretty bad," said organizer Micah Rhodes, "but our ancestors lived through much worse."The group is protesting a police officers' contract approved by the Portland City Council this week, as well as the use of force by police in removing protesters from City Hall after they disrupted the council meeting. They want Hales, who shaped the contract as commissioner in charge of police force, to resign, and they have said they'll seek to recall Commissioner Nick Fish, who voted for the contract.On Friday, they marched through Southeast Portland neighborhoods before settling down with camping equipment near Hales' house.Hales, who tweeted from an event Friday night, hasn't been seen, though protesters say it appears someone is in the home.A small contingent of police officers were parked nearby, monitoring the encampment.The protesters are undecided as to whether they will stay another night.Heavy, potentially damaging winds are expected in the Portland area around midday. The encampment sits along a tree-lined street where falling limbs could be dangerous.But the worst of the rain is believed to have passed, and Rhodes said he hopes more people would join the protest Saturday regardless.He said there would likely be a march Saturday, although plans haven't been finalized."We're still here," he said.-- Elliot Njusenjus@oregonian.com 503-294-5034 @enjusAllan Brettman contributed to this reportNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).Â© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
