"We need police. Without them, it's lawlessness. But we could live without the brutality and the disrespect." BROCKTON – A rally against police brutality hit the streets of downtown Brockton on Friday night, following of week of shocking violence throughout the nation, which claimed the lives of law enforcement and civilians.Several police officers were looking down from the roof of the city's parking garage, as a group of more than 100 mostly black protesters marched on Main Street chanting thunderously for justice."What do we want? Justice!" they shouted. "When do we want it? Now! If we don't get it? Shut it down!"Community activist and civic leader Ollie Spears said the Brockton march was planned prior to the sniper attack that claimed the lives of five police officers in Dallas on Thursday, in the middle of what was a similarly peaceful, but much larger protest in the Texas city. Like the Dallas protest, Spears said the rally in Brockton was organized as a show of solidarity in response to the deaths of black men at the hands of law enforcement officers in Baton Rouge and Minnesota earlier this week. There was no second thoughts about putting on the rally following Thursday's tragic news, and no one from the city asked organizers to reconsider, Spears said."We can care about Black Lives Matter and support the police," Spears said. "We need police. Without them, it's lawlessness. But we could live without the brutality and the disrespect. ... We need law and order. But at the same time, you don't want to get shot for a broken tail light."The mass shooting of police by a gunman in Dallas was discussed among participants in the march, Spears said. The Brockton man, who sits on the Planning Board and previously ran for City Council, said that kind of violent response will lead the country down a "wicked path" that's no good for anybody."Everyone condemns that," Spears said. "No one wants to see police officers shot. No one wants to see police officers shooting people."Before the march set off, Bishop Tony Branch preached to the crowd and prayed for the family of Alton Sterling, who was killed by police in Baton Rouge on Tuesday, in addition to the relatives of all the officers shot to death in Dallas. Branch called out to God asking to bring healing to a "nation of violence" and to comfort the afflicted. "We're together today because we know that some of us have been murdered, unjustly," said Branch, who is also the chairman of the mayor-appointed Brockton Diversity Commission. "This is a time for prayer because there are rumors that we're not peaceful people. ... They will not tell the story that the black and brown are not people of peace, because we are," The Brockton protest started with a rally in front of Brockton District Court, where speakers took turns on a megaphone. Then participants walked in the streets to Legion Parkway, and headed to Frederick Douglass Park for more speeches.There were no problems or incidents during the Brockton protest, which was led by Bradley Souffrant, a 19-year-old from the city, Spears said. Groups like the Brockton Interfaith Coalition were also involved, but no elected officials were present, he said."There was a lot of smiles, a lot of hugs, a lot of laughs," Spears said. "At the same time, we're talking about a serious situation, and we were able to congregate in a civil manner with nothing but love."Following up on the march, which was titled "For My Unborn Black Son," there will be a meeting on City Hall Plaza at noon on Sunday to discuss tangible steps to toward addressing police mistreatment and institutional racism. Spears said that, fortunately, residency rules in Brockton mean that police who work in the city are usually more invested in the community and often grew up here. "That doesn't mean we don't have problems," Spears said. "Every city has problems."Spears said the city has taken some strides since there were just two black police officers in the old days. But he said more could be done in terms of improving interactions between police and the citizens they encounter on the job. A little more respect can go a long way, said Spears, adding that that the department should have a more diverse group of supervising officers.Spears gave credit to the many Brockton police officers who helped block traffic for the march. By the end of the march, Spears was taking a picture with Brockton police officer Nichole Anderson.On top of the city's parking garage, Spears said he saw several police officers watching the protesters, including at least one who was armed with a rifle."Waive to police, tell them we don't hate you," Spears said, recalling his thoughts. "We love you. We want you to protect us." Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you. Digital access or digital and print delivery.
