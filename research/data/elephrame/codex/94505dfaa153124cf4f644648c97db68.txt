(Naomi Nix | NJ Advance Media for Nj.com)NEWARK — Newark activists hit the streets Friday evening after a grand jury failed to indict three police officers in the fatal 2013 shooting of an Irvington man.The activists marched from the corner of Market and Washington Streets down to the calling jury's decision not to indict the officers who killed 30-year-old Abdul Kamal an injustice."We are outraged by that decision," said Larry Hamm, chairman of the People's Organization for Progress. "We can't understand how that verdict was possibly reached."Hamm continued to say that the group is calling for New Jersey U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman to launch an investigation to see whether Kamal's civil rights were violated."If that is so then bring civil rights charges against the officers that killed him," he said.Kamal was killed on Nov. 11, 2013 after three officers open fire on him after he allegedly broke into his estranged wife's home, according to prosecutors.During a confrontation with six responding officers, Kamal began to remove his right hand from his pocket while threatening to shoot police, the Essex County Prosecutor's Office said in a statement today.Kamal, who died at the scene, was later found to be unarmed and with only a cell phone in his pocket, authorities said.Kamal, who's wife had recently obtained a restraining order against him, had a history of domestic violence, authorities said. His family maintains he suffered from mental illness.Protestor Sheila Montague said the jury's decision today was disappointing especially in light of the national conversation about police, violence and race. "We are just sorry that yet another black man has fallen to police brutality," said Montague, a district leader and Newark activist. "This was a very sad ordeal today that they still didn't bring back an indictment."Naomi Nix may be reached at nnix@njadvancemedia.com. Follow her on Twitter @nsnix87.
