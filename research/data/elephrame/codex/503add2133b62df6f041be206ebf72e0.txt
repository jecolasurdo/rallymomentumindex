It also called for the appointment of an independent prosecutor in police shooting and excessive force cases and pointed to a lack of Portland police diversity."Whether Quanice Hayes was guilty or not of personal robbery it is not the responsibility of the Police Officer to act as Judge or Jury and carry out the sentence," the group said in a statement."How can you put a bullet through the head of a young teenager on his knees (probably giving up) as well as two additional bullets in his body," the alliance continued. "We know the PPB is trained to shoot for the center mass, so the shot to the head is inconsistent with training."The alliance represents church leaders and others who have pushed for police reforms.Read the full statementhere.The service ended a week in which a Multnomah County grand jury delivered its decision Tuesday that a Portland police officer was justified in shooting Hayes, a suspect in an armed robbery, outside a home in Northeast Portland. The day after the grand jury's decision was announced, Hayes' mother, Venus Hayes, called for a federal investigation of the circumstances of her son's death, criticizing the way Portland police and the Multnomah County District Attorney's Office handled the case.At the service, Hayes' cousin, Terrence Hayes, delivered an eight-minute eulogy that fondly remembered the family member known as "Moose," but it also used his relative's death to draw attention to broader issues of relations between African Americans and police in Portland as well as across the United States.Terrence Hayes, who also spoke three weeks ago outside a Portland City Council meeting about his cousin's death, said, "Portland police and other police around this nation" pose a threat to black men."At some point, enough brains have to be stacked for y'all to see reality," Hayes said in an apparent reference to black men killed nationwide in officer-involved shootings.Hayes, pacing at the front of the church with a wireless microphone, recalled seeing three children recently outside of his home playing with guns. None was black."I had to apologize to my sons," he said, "because I can't allow them to do that. They can't have water guns, BB guns - everything the law of this land supposedly allows for them has been denied."Hayes also offered his opinion about young African American men and women recognizing their value.Speaking to the women, he said, "There is a war to devalue you in this country ... the moment you stand up for what you're worth? Watch these little dudes do it, too."Before Hayes spoke, about a dozen friends and family members stood before the audience to remember Hayes. And before that, Pastor Roy Clay combined Biblical readings with solo renditions of spiritual music, backed by an organ and drummer.Moments after people had slowly filed out of the tiny church at Northeast Mason Church and Garfield Avenue, about 50 people gathered at the intersection. Some held a banner reading "Justice for Quanice Hayes."For at least 15 minutes, they stood in the pouring rain chanting, "Say his name: Quanice Hayes," and "Black lives matter."Before the funeral, Hayes' uncle, Steven Hayes, said the family didn't condone protests in front of Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler's house - something that has happened on at least two occasions. All they wanted, he said, was for police to be held accountable."We don't want Officer (Andrew) Hearst on the streets again," he said.He was referring to the officer who shot Hayes three times. Hearst has been involved in two fatal shootings in the past five years, and Steven Hayes said he should not be allowed to patrol anymore.Hearst was one of three officers who fatally shot a man in 2013. Merle Hatch, 50, had a mental illness diagnosis. He was carrying a broken telephone handset, which he said was a gun. A grand jury found no wrongdoing in that case.The grand this week said Hearst was justified in shooting Hayes three times - once in the head, twice in the torso - on Feb. 9. Police had been searching for an armed robbery suspect who matched Hayes' description.-- Allan Brettmanabrettman@oregonian.com@allanbrettman-- Samantha Matsumotosmatsumoto@oregonian.com@SMatsumoto55Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).Â© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
