Alexander, 22, and Nijel Watson, 25, from Middletown, the protest had more than 400 demonstrators gathered in the parking lot of the town government center on Sunday. Up the hill from the town's court and police station, police used yellow tape to block off part of the parking lot for about a dozen officers, while the rest of the lot made space for protesters."It's time for us to be a change for our young, black people of color,” Watson said. "And it's time to let our voices be heard and unify our community. We're not against each other, we're not enemies; our community needs to be united as one.”Participants read poems, gave emotional speeches and shared their thoughts on what police can do differently to make the community safer. This was one of at least three different protests in the mid-Hudson on Sunday.Route 211 was closed in one direction for nearly an hour Sunday due to the four-hour protest.Town of Wallkill police, with help from state police, Middletown police and the Orange County Sheriff's Office, controlled traffic and closed off exits on Route 17 leading to Route 211 to keep traffic down, said Robert Hertman, Wallkill police chief."We wanted to ensure the safety of the protesters,” Hertman said.The protest was organized in the wake of the suspension of former Washington Heights fire chief, Charles Healy, for using racist language to describe protesters demonstrating in Middletown on Monday."We had a black president, they called him a monkey,” a protester said Sunday. "We have a leader in this town who called us monkeys.”Unlike the protest in Middletown, where police were invited to walk and participate in the demonstrations, the Wallkill town police officers were there to listen, Watson and Alexander said."If they don't understand the injustices that they are doing or they don't feel like they understand what's happening, it would be counterproductive for them to try to jump into a march with us,” Alexander said.During the protest at one point, the audience took a knee to honor black lives lost, like George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis when his neck was knelt on for nearly 9 minutes on May 25.Demonstrators called for police to kneel with them. Another protester stood up to stop them."I don't want that same knee (that killed George Floyd) kneeling in front of me,” she said.Bridgette Corley, of the Town of Wallkill, marched in memory of the uncle she never got to meet. Russell Corley was a teenager when he was shot and killed in a dispute with police in 1958.Corley said she comes from a family of police officers."Not all cops are bad,” she said, "but there is a lot we have to root out.”rettlinger@th-record.comCareers Accessibility Site Map Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscribers Guide My AccountNewsletters Facebook Twitter E-EditionJobs Cars Homes Classifieds Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2020 www.recordonline.com.
