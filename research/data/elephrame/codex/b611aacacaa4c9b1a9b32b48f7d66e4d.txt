We're trying to stop the gun violence,” Isaiah Bryant said while standing near the Alexandria Levee Park Amphitheatre.Bryant, 19, of Pineville, is one of the organizers of the rally, which was attended by about a dozen people, most of whom are black and in their late teens or early 20s.CLOSE Isaiah Bryant, 19, organizer of the unity rally in downtown Alexandria, was intended to give youth a voice about the direction of the community. He said he is seeking "unity and justice” in Central Louisiana and in the country as a whole."If the world sees unity, they'll have faith and hope because right now we don't have too much faith and hope,” Bryant said.Buy PhotoIsaiah Bryant (Photo: Melinda Martinez/The Town Talk)"We're doing it (holding the rally) to get together, and we can feel like we're one and to make gun violence awareness,” said Daisha Broomfield, 19, of Alexandria."We realize we have a lot of anger and sadness in the community, and we need to join together to support one another,” she said.Bryant said the event, organized through social media, was part of the Black Lives Matter movement, although there was no national Black Lives Matter presence.Bryant held a sign saying "Black Lives Matter” while some others held signs with messages such a "Family Matters” and "Black Magic.”The event was originally supposed to take place at 3 p.m. outside Alexandria City Hall. It started about 20 to 30 minutes late as those attending moved to the Levee Park Amphitheatre as a thunderstorm approached the area.Local law enforcement officials were well-prepared in case the Alexandria rally got out of hand. A protest related to the fatal shooting of Alton Sterling by a police officer in Baton Rouge led to more than 100 arrests Saturday in Baton Rouge."We're ready,” Rapides Parish Sheriff William Earl Hilton said about 2 p.m.As it turned out, the rally was peaceful, but Alexandria Police Lt. Bruce Fairbanks said law enforcement wanted to make sure they were prepared.Buy PhotoRapides Parish sheriff's deputies wait in the parish courthouse parking lot Sunday afternoon in case they were needed for security at a Black Lives Matter rally in downtown Alexandria. Numerous law enforcement agencies were prepared in case of trouble, but the rally was small and peaceful. (Photo: Melinda Martinez/The Town Talk)"We prepared for the worst and hoped for the best. We wanted to have the manpower necessary to handle any situation that might arise,” Fairbanks said.At the rally, there were "no incidents, no acts of violence, no criminal activity reported. The demonstration was peaceful from what we observed. No complaints from anyone,” Fairbanks said. Agencies that were involved in preparing for possible incidents at the rally included the Alexandria Police Department, the Rapides Parish Sheriff's Office, the Grant Parish Sheriff's Office, the Pineville Police Department, State Police, Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness, the U.S. Marshals Violent Offender Task Force and Rapides 911 Communications District.Hilton, Alexandria Police Chief Loren Lampert and Grant Parish Sheriff Steven McCain were among the law enforcement officials gathered at the Alexandria Police Department before the rally.Also on hand were officers from different departments, some wearing body armor. A tactical vehicle was seen in the APD parking lot about 2 p.m. Alexandria Police officers were stationed in vehicles in and around the City Hall area, but they did not have an overt presence close to the rally.Buy PhotoLaw enforcement officials and personnel wait at the Alexandria Police Department on Sunday afternoon in advance of a Black Lives Matter rally in downtown Alexandria.

(Photo: Richard Sharkey/The Town Talk)Bryant said young adults like himself are the next generation of leaders and need to speak up in the fight for justice."We want to do something positive for the community,” Bryant said. "We want to show Alexandria we've got something new to offer.”Referring to recent high-profile incidents around the nation of officers shooting black men, Bryant said, "It's a lot of injustice. Police are getting away with killing innocent black people because they have a badge and their chest on their shoulder. It shouldn't be like that."If that's the case, all these other people that are killing black people, they should just walk out the courtroom and be free and innocent people ...”Kyle Bridgewater, 20, of Alexandria, said too many people around the country "are dismissing” the recent incidents of officers shooting black men."I believe we should all be together as a family,” said Bridgewater, who held a sign that said "Family Matters.”Bryant said he had notified a city official about the peaceful protest.More than a dozen Rapides Parish sheriff's deputies were gathered in the parish courthouse parking lot next to a line of about 10 patrol vehicles.About 2:30 p.m., APD issued this statement on its website: "The Alexandria Police Department is requesting the public to avoid the down town Alexandria area until further notice due to possible congestion.”The statement did not mention the rally.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://www.thetowntalk.com/story/news/local/2016/07/10/peaceful-black-lives-matter-rally-calls-unity-justice/86920338/Find JobsShare your feedback to help improve our site experience!
