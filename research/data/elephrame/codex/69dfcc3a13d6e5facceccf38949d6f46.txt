Camden County police officers join residents in march against racismJim Walsh, Cherry Hill Courier-Post Published 5:09 p.m. ET May 30, 2020 | Updated 1:06 p.m. ET May 31, 2020CLOSE Camden County police and members of Camden's clergy speak out in the wake of Minneapolis man's death Cherry Hill Courier-PostCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECAMDEN - Police officers who patrol this city followed a different path Saturday, joining residents in a march against racism.Elected officials and religious leaders also took part in the peaceful demonstration, which began as a grass-roots protest to the police-involved death of a Minneapolis man on Memorial Day.Meanwhile, more South Jersey law enforcement agencies released statements critical of the Minneapolis police action, which has sparked sometimes violent protests across the country.More: Tensions rise at Philadelphia region protests in response to George Floyd's deathMore: South Jersey law enforcement officials decry police brutalityResidents who gathered outside the downtown Police Administration Building said they wanted to show support for Minneapolis residents and others outraged by the death of George Floyd.A video showed Floyd died when a Minneapolis police officer kept a knee on his neck for several minutes during an arrest. Three other officers at the scene failed to come to the dying man's aid.Daniela Martinez and her 7-year-old niece Angelee Rodriguez, both of Camden, took part in a demonstration against racism on Saturday. (Photo: Jim Walsh, Courier-Post)"We stand in solidarity with the people of Minneapolis," said Maniyah Figueroa, a Camden woman who took part in the 1½-mile march."It was heartbreaking to see the video," said Figueroa. "But I'm not going to say I was surprised. It's been going on for a long time,” she said."The people of Minneapolis do not stand alone," added Daniela Martinez, who attended the demonstration with her 7-year-old niece Angelee Rodriguez.Both carried hand-written signs on brightly colored posters."Black lives matter,” said a bright pink sign held by Angelee, while her aunt's neon green poster read "#georgefloyd.”The protest's organizer, hair salon operator Yolanda "Yonnie" Deaver, initially expected participants would come from her social-media followers.But then a friend on the police force asked if she could walk, too, Deaver recounted Sunday."I said, 'Of course!'" said Deaver, who heard next from a lieutenant and then from Chief Joseph Wysocki."I told them my message was solidarity, justice for George Floyd and black lives matter,” said Deaver."He (Wysocki) told me he felt the same way I did,” said Deaver.Chief Wysocki on the march today, standing together with the residents we serve to remember and honor George Floyd. #StrongerTogether#CamdenStrongpic.twitter.com/UJAjxXkxrx— Camden County Police (@CamdenCountyPD) May 31, 2020She said Wysocki walked at the front of the march and helped to hold a banner that proclaimed "Standing in Solidarity.""He was chanting 'Black Lives Matter,'" she noted. "It turned out really nice. I felt so moved and inspired," Deaver said of the march, which began outside her business, Prissy Chic Hair Company on Mount Ephraim Avenue near Thurman Street.Wysocki and members of the city's clergy had decried Floyd's death at a press conference on Thursday, where speakers praised the local department's emphasis on de-escalation techniques and community relations.In a statement Sunday, Wysocki said the department's participation in the march "was another example of our ongoing engagement, and a very real dialogue, that we are having with residents throughout Camden."As part of that approach, the police department offered beverages and masks to marchers. It also stationed a Mr. Softee truck outside the downtown police station to distribute free ice cream treats to demonstrators.Camden County Freeholder Director Louis Cappelli Jr. said the officers' role in the "unity walk" reflected a focus on "direct interaction, relationship building and community policing."Systematic injustices cannot continue, & we will march to unite change. pic.twitter.com/L1GpBkzmU0— Donald Norcross (@DonaldNorcross) May 30, 2020That emphasis was implemented after the county department's creation in mid-2013 amidst controversy and allegations of union-busting. It replaced a smaller municipal police force that had been depleted by layoffs.The march also grew to include Mayor Francisco "Frank" Moran and Rep. Donald Norcross, D-Camden, as well as other local leaders."Systematic injustices cannot continue, & we will march to unite change," Norcross tweeted after the event.Deaver said she organized her first-ever protest march after deciding a trip to demonstrate in Minneapolis would be too dangerous."My father told me to always follow my heart,” she said."If we stand together and stop being so divided, we can accomplish anything,” Deaver continued."Love will always conquer.”Separately, Acting Camden County Prosecutor Jill Mayer said Floyd's death "undermines" the relationship between law enforcement and the community."It also highlights that there is much more work to be done and it cannot be accomplished by staying silent," she said.Gloucester Township Police Chief David Harkins said he was "disheartened and disgusted" by Floyd's death.He said the township's officers were directed to watch the video "and reflect on what was done wrong.""I asked all of the officers, dispatchers, and civilian staff to reflect on 'why we do what we do' as servants to our community. We will honor the memory of Mr. Floyd by striving to do even better," Harkins said.Similar statements were released Thursday and Friday by chiefs for the Cherry Hill, Winslow and Camden County police departments.Also Saturday, prosecutor's offices across South Jersey joined in releasing a statement that described Floyd's death as "deeply disturbing.""Our community has the right to trust that they will be treated fairly and justly by the officers who serve them," said the statement from the County Prosecutors Association of New Jersey.It urged anyone "who believes they have been victimized by a member of law enforcement as a result of bias or other improper behavior" to contact the officer's chief or the local county prosecutor's office.Jim Walsh is a free-range reporter who's been roaming around South Jersey for decades.
