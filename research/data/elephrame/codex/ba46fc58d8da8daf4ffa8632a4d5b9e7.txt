(Photo: Ebony Cox/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)Protesters of all ages and races filled the streets as they walked from Leicht Memorial Park early Sunday afternoon chanting "Same story every time, being black is not a crime" and "Back, back up, we want freedom, freedom. Racist a** cops we don't need 'em, need 'em." Other chants included "Silence is violence," "No justice, no peace," and "Justice for Floyd. Convict all four," in reference to the four officers involved in Floyd's death. Many were dressed in "#ICantBreathe" or Black Lives Matter T-shirts for the march, which continued for nearly two hours. People held up signs that portrayed images and names of all those killed by police or messages such as "I am not invisible."Protesters began gathering at the park at 11 a.m. The protest began about noon with protesters kneeling in silence for eight minutes and 46 seconds, the time that Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on Floyd's neck.At the start of the protest, community organizer Dajahnae Williams and Mayor Eric Genrich told the crowd that the city has lifted the curfew it imposed in the wake of violence and property damage following a peaceful protest in downtown Green Bay on May 31.Williams said the end of the curfew followed a week of discussions aimed at helping city leaders understand the protests "as humans," rather than as officials.Abby Ringel, one of the organizers of the protests, stressed earlier in the week that the protest would be peaceful, and she hopes marches will keep happening in the state to make police reform happen."It needs to be at the forefront at our community," she said.FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInSunday protest in downtown Green Bay to demand end to police violence FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

Organizers estimated the protest grew to about 2,500 people at its peak.Protesters instead continued south to Mason Street after stopping only briefly at the police headquarters. ‚Ä™Robin Tinnon, a cofounder of Black Lives United Green Bay and executive director of We All Rise African American Resource Center, said the large crowds are showing up to marches because people had more time during the coronavirus pandemic to reflect on what it means to live with a danger they can't control.In particular, she said, the pandemic made "white folks fear for their lives in a way they couldn't control. White folks fear a virus that will sneak up on them.‚ÄùBuy PhotoProtesters observe a moment of silence for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, the time that a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on George Floyd's neck, before marching from Leicht Park to the Green Bay police department. (Photo: Benita Mathew/USA TODAY NETWORK-Wisconsin)It helped many better understand Floyd's helplessness as he died, she said."The world could relate and were interconnected in a way that nobody expected," she said.The crowd included large numbers of high school and college students from the greater Green Bay area. Trinity Paholke, a student at Bonduel High School, said she went to the protest in Shawano Wednesday with her sister Alana as the message to end police brutality continues to spread into small towns nationwide."It's (Shawano) a really small town. We didn't expect a lot of people to show up but there were still a good couple hundred people," she said.Williams said she is grateful for the support of white and non-black allies who showed to protest.Kristina Shelton, a member of the Green Bay school board, said she attended the protest because she said it's time for white people to put their lives, property, rights, and privileges "on the line."Because of the consistently strong turnout at the protests this week, Green Bay resident Trenitty Mosley said she hopes concrete actions are implemented, specifically more training on use of force for police officers.The march ended about 2 p.m at Frank B. Seymour Park, 330 S. Oakland Ave., where Black Lives United Green Bay hosted a post-protest picnic.Participant Chauncey Hughes said he hopes holding events like the picnic will continue to move the conversation about race and injustice forward."Through these community gatherings we are finding a new way to have a dialogue about uncomfortable issues and that's the goal," Hughes said.Jonathon Tubby's family spoke to the crowd about their pain that resurfaced after Floyd's death, which they said was entirely preventable. Tubby was shot and killed in October 2018 by Green Bay police officer Erik O'Brien as he was being taken into the Brown County Jail. "It took the police chief one year and seven months to make a public apology to our family," said Danielle Karl, Tubby's cousin.She said the family wants O'Brien, who shot and killed Tubby, to be fired immediately.Protesters were not done after one march. They took a shorter trip for about 30 minutes, along Ashland Avenue and North Broadway, before returning to the park for a picnic. Around 7 p.m. they set out on a third and final march of the day. They marched back across the Walnut Street bridge and eventually reached the Mason Street bridge and again spread out over it. They paused at several busy intersections; instead of police blocking traffic other protesters drove with the crowd and let their cars serve as barricades.The crowd paused for a moment of silence for Trayvon Martin, a black 17-year-old was was killed in 2012 in Sanford, Florida at his time of death, 7:25 p.m.As 9 p.m., the former city curfew, rolled around more police cars appeared. They promised a quiet presence throughout the day but several were spotted as protesters returned to Seymour Park.Some onlookers antagonized marchers and small disputes broke out, but organizers were dedicated to keeping the protest peaceful. Several leaders quietly settled conflicts, seemingly without police involved. Organizers told everyone to go home shortly after 9 p.m. and most left the park.By the time Sunday's protest ended, participants had marched three times in one day. Some had also participated in protests on Saturday and the weekend before.Contact Benita Mathew at (920) 309-3428 or bmathew@gannett.com.
