(KNWA) ‚Äî A protest and candlelight vigil was held Wednesday evening outside the Fort Smith Police Department in the wake of a recent officer-involved shooting. Dozens of protesters marched up and down Garrison Avenue and stood outside the Fort Smith Police Department. The protest was over the death of 27-year-old Samuel Morris, who police say they shot when they found him holding a woman hostage at knifepoint this past weekend. Many of the protesters are family members of Morris. Police released audio of the fatal officer-involved shooting. Police responded to a domestic disturbance call at an apartment complex on Johnson Street when they found 27-year-old Samuel Morris holding a woman hostage with a knife.
