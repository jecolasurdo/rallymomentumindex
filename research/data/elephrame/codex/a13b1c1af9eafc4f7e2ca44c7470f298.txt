Rooftop sharpshooters watched protesters below at Jefferson Square before law enforcement fired tear gas to disperse the crowd. The curfew took effect at 9 p.m., but police in riot gear faced off with demonstrators well after midnight in the Highlands.In a late-evening media briefing, Mayor Greg Fischer said police made "about 10 arrests."Read more:At least 5 of 6 protesters arrested in Louisville demonstrations Friday were localsWhile Louisville grabbed national headlines Thursday and Friday, other cities around the country were in Saturday's spotlight. Chaotic, violent and fiery scenes played out in such places as New York City, Los Angeles, Indianapolis, Chicago and Washington, D.C.Protesters' outrage in those cities were fueled largely by the death of George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck.In Louisville Saturday morning, city officials said the turbulent gatherings of Thursday and Friday — Fischer likened the situation to "terrorism...on the streets of our city" — had to stop."(Friday was) a very sad night for our city, and as violence has raged across many cities in our country, it has been a sad night for America," Fischer said early Saturday morning following a destructive night of protests."There does need to be ample recognition of the underlying inequity that causes so much of the frustration that we see in America and in our city."But there is no excuse for the destruction of property we've seen (Friday) evening," he said. "This is not protest; it is violence."To help maintain peace, Gov. Andy Beshear activated the National Guard, with about 350 soldiers arriving in Louisville by Saturday afternoon."I hope everybody knows this is a big step and a tough step, and it's not one intended to silence any voice, because I want to hear," Beshear said. "But I want to make sure at the end of the day that we are all safe.”Louisville woke up Saturday morning to stunning evidence of vandals' hourslong rampage the night before. Destruction was spotted across downtown.Fourth Street Live took the brunt of the looting that started Friday night and continued early Saturday morning. Several bars were broken into and liquor was stolen. T-Mobile on Fourth and Liberty streets was trashed and looted, the alarm still blaring. Shelves and racks were empty where phones and accessories had been stolen. It was hard to find a building not tagged by spray-painted anti-police messages.Downtown was littered with people Saturday morning, walking their dogs, cellphones out, taking photos and surveying the damage. Many shook their heads or volunteered to help sweep away the shattered storefront glass.Graffiti littered the facade of nearly every building. Broken window panes at the Metro Department of Corrections were a reminder of Thursday evening, the first night of protests.Recap:What you may have missed at Saturday's Breonna Taylor protests in LouisvilleLMPD partitioned off downtown streets where crews were cleaning up Saturday, with people sweeping the shards of glass off of the sidewalk on nearly every block.Juniyah Palmer, Taylor's younger sister, took to social media to denounce the destruction early Saturday morning."At this point, y'all are no longer doing this for my sister! You guys are just vandalizing stuff for NO reason!" she wrote on Facebook. "Once y'all started vandalism, you took my sister's name out of place! I honestly feel like you guys are disrespecting my family wishes for a safe and NON-VIOLENT protest!"No one should be surprised by the kinds of unrest we're seeing, Fischer said Saturday afternoon."If you feel like you're not being heard, you're going to shout a lot louder, and a lot more emphatically," he said.But he also decried the chaos that dominated much of Friday night and was quick to blame it on "outside agitators" and "anarchists" intent on causing destruction.Six people were arrested, and six police officers were injured.Fischer's order placed all of Louisville Metro on a 9 p.m. to 6:30 a.m. curfew for Saturday and Sunday nights, preventing residents from being in the streets, parks and other public spaces.

But once it gets dark, and once the more anarchic element of this starts appearing, people can get caught up in that."The curfew was to end Sunday morning and be reevaluated Monday morning. In Louisville, Taylor's death was the catalyst for downtown protests.The 26-year-old emergency room tech was at her southwest Louisville apartment when police entered her home on a no-knock search warrant related to a narcotics investigation in the early morning hours of March 13.Officers returned fire after Taylor's boyfriend fired a shot at what he said he believed to be intruders. No drugs were recovered from the apartment.Taylor's death has garnered national attention in recent weeks, alongside other high-profile killings of black Americans — some at the hands of police officers — that have sparked massive demonstrations across the country.He explains:Why isn't Mayor Greg Fischer attending Louisville's Breonna Taylor protests?On Monday, Minneapolis police killed Floyd when an officer pressed his knee into Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes. Floyd's death was captured on video and shared widely. The ensuing nights of protests resulted in Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz announcing Saturday that he would be "fully mobilizing" the state's National Guard.Floyd's death came at a time when many Americans were already outraged over the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, who was jogging in a south Georgia neighborhood when he was shot and killed by white men.In Louisville, protesters carried signs and chanted about both Taylor and Floyd."Breonna Taylor! Breonna Taylor! Breonna Taylor!" hundreds of people shouted at City Hall, their fists hoisted in the air.Thursday's protest began downtown around 5 p.m., just a couple of hours after the public heard the frantic 911 call made by Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, as she lay in the hall of her apartment, struck by at least eight bullets.Seven people were shot during Thursday night's smaller, but still raucous, protest, with two injuries serious enough to require surgery. Police did not fire those shots, LMPD officials said.On Saturday morning, Fischer said "the tone clearly changed" Friday night."The number of people on our street clearly changed (Friday) night, as well," he said. "This turned from being a peaceful protest into violence and terrorism and looting on the streets of our city."People returned to Louisville's downtown streets in even larger numbers Friday night. While many remained peaceful, vandals wreaked havoc across much of downtown: windows of office buildings, at least one hotel and restaurants were smashed. Looters sidestepped broken windows and rummaged through the bar area of Eddie Merlot's Prime Aged Beef & Seafood, hauling away armfuls of alcohol. Opinion:When there is a knee on our necks, anger is an act of righteous resistanceThroughout the night, Courier Journal reporters and photographers saw canisters of tear gas being fired; heard flash bangs exploding; and spotted numerous fires in trash cans and recycling bins. Shards of glass were everywhere, and anti-police graffiti was spray-painted on buildings and sidewalks.Earlier in the evening, tensions rose as protesters spotted law enforcement officers inside the Hall of Justice. Protesters ripped the American and Kentucky flags from their poles in front of the building, using lighters and alcohol to set them ablaze.Some hurled water bottles and other hard objects at the courthouse windows, splintering the glass. Other panes were smeared with red paint hand prints, made to look like blood.Anthony Davis, a protester on Friday night, said violence was not the goal."We don't want to become violent," he said."Frustration will cause violence to surface. You can't stop that."Fischer said Saturday night's crowd was "significantly smaller and easier to manage.”The main flashpoints were downtown and in the Highlands.Fischer said 10 people had been arrested as of 10:30 p.m. and police had confiscated a number of items including long guns and sticks.Asked why police earlier Saturday had destroyed or confiscated stacks of water and milk downtown — stockpiled by protesters to ward off effects of tear gas — Fischer said such stashes had included items including mason jars full of "flammable material” that could have been used against the public or police.Reporter Savannah Eadens contributed to this report.Reach Tessa Duvall at tduvall@courier-journal.com and 502-582-4059.
