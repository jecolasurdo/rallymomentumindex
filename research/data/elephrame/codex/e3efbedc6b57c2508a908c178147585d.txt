Hicks | jhicks3@mlive.com GRAND RAPIDS, MI -- As thousands of Donald Trump supporters lined up at the doors of the DeVos Place Convention Center on Monday evening, a much smaller group stood together across the street.Standing in protest, about 30 people raised signs opposing Trump as a presidential candidate. Some stood quietly. Others hollered back and forth with those awaiting the Republican candidate's final Michigan rally before election day."I don't think a racist should be president of the United States," said 20-year-old Gabrielle Nunez. "I don't agree with how he treats people, and it's 2016; we should finally have a woman president."Before arriving to protest, Nunez attended Hillary Clinton's afternoon rally at Grand Valley State University. Comparing the two experiences, she said protesters on the Allendale campus were "less peaceful and less respectful.""This is overwhelming. These supporters are intense."Trump was expected to speak at 11 p.m. in Grand Rapids, but was running behind from an earlier rally in New Hampshire. The DeVos Center was packed and Trump supporter Ted Nugent was playing for the crowd.Chants outside from protesters varied from "Love trumps hate!" to "Black lives matter!" Some shouted obscenities."Trump is a comedian," said Bridget Gothao, 39, of Grand Rapids. "He wants to kick people out of the country and people aren't leaving without a fight."Paul Morisette, 19, found himself on the same side of the street as the protesters Monday, though he said it had nothing to do with which candidate he is supporting.The Grand Blanc native said he crossed the street after he said he was spit on by a man standing in line to enter the convention center."I feel safer on this side," he said. "I don't support anyone. I'm just out here to witness history."Trump's Grand Rapids rally was his fifth and final stop of the day, making a final push to get voters to the polls for the Nov. 8 election.Earlier in the day, Clinton made a plea for voters at Grand Valley State University. And Trump's daughters, Ivanka and Tiffany, were in Grand Rapids Monday morning to meet with supporters. President Barack Obama rallied for Clinton earlier in the day in Ann Arbor.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).Â© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
