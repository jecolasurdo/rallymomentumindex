A day after the country learned Wilson won't face criminal charges for killing unarmed teenager Michael Brown, protests sprouted up in more than 170 U.S. cities. Some demonstrations blocked bridges, tunnels and major highways. But unlike the violence that erupted in Ferguson on Monday night, the protests across the country Tuesday night were largely peaceful. New York A massive protest wound its way from Union Square to FDR Drive and to the United Nations, Times Square and Harlem. "Now it's not clear where we're going," said CNN's Miguel Marquez, who was interviewing protesters as they continued marching after midnight. One demonstrator said he didn't even know about the protest until he saw it pass by his workplace on Times Square. He decided to join in. "I just want to help bring about change ... sometimes I am profiled based on my race," said the protester, who is black. "I think this is progress ... now we're going to make sure things are going to change." As they marched, some protesters chanted, "Mike Brown! Mike Brown!" Police, who were nearby in large numbers, stayed back and let the marchers go. Oakland, California Perhaps the greatest concentration of turmoil Tuesday night was in Oakland, where vandals smashed the windows of a car dealership and looted several businesses, including a T-Mobile cell phone store. Some also set several bonfires in the city. One row of bonfires stretched across a road, blocking off access, footage from CNN affiliate KPIX showed. Some people were seen adding more items to the fires. Los Angeles A stretch of the 101 Freeway in Los Angeles was shut down in both directions after protesters took road blocks from the streets, along with debris, and placed them on the freeway, police said. And demonstrators gathered outside of the Los Angeles Police Department headquarters, Officer Sara Faden said. Faden said protesters are demonstrating peacefully. An LAPD spokesman said officers are allowing people to vent. "We have detained people. We don't have any property damage to speak of," Officer Jack Richter said. "We are letting (the people) exercise their constitutional rights." Boston Mayor Marty Walsh estimated about 1,000 protesters took to the streets Tuesday night. The gathering has been largely peaceful. "It's a beautiful thing to see," demonstrator Daniel Jose Older said.

Some protesters had also gathered outside CNN Center. 'It's a travesty' Some Atlanta protesters held signs that read "Enough" and "We are all one bullet away from being a hashtag." One demonstrator wore a T-shirt that read, "Racism isn't over but I'm over racism." "It's a travesty; it's just not right," ShaCzar Brown said as held up a sign that said, "Stop killer cops." "Seventy years ago, it was legal to kill black people," Brown says, referring to the spate of lynchings that spread through the U.S. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. "It's essentially still legal." Atlanta, birthplace of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., also saw emotional reaction Monday night when about 200 students gathered at Morehouse College to hear the grand jury's decision. A collective gasp rippled through the crowd when it came. Some of the students at the historically black men's school looked at one another in disbelief, others started to tear up, and a few stared ahead as their jaws dropped. Police sirens wailed in the distance as the students chanted: "Ferguson's hell is America's hell."
