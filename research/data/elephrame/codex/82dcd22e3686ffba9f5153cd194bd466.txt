Gunfire erupted after hundreds of protesters took to the streets demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, who in March was shot and killed in her apartment by Louisville police — one of several deaths of unarmed African Americans drawing national attention in recent weeks.Anger over the deaths boiled over in protests across the U.S. on Thursday evening, including the violent clash on Louisville's streets that, as of early Friday morning, had left at least one gunshot victim in critical condition. Louisville police did not shoot their guns, according to an LMPD spokesperson."It is not a riot," said Councilwoman Keisha Dorsey, who watched as hundreds gathered Thursday night."It is a revolt against a system in which people have felt oppressed. What I'm seeing is people who are trying their best to do something with their hurt, their pain and their frustration." Dorsey, D-3rd District, represents Shively and part of western Louisville.Who was Breonna Taylor?

She was struck by at least eight bullets.Throughout the evening, many protesters could be seen holding both hands in the air, as if to show they were unarmed.

Jonathan Mattingly and officers Brett Hankison and Myles Cosgrove — be fired. They've also called for a ban on no-knock warrants. No drugs were recovered from Taylor's home. Her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired his weapon and struck a police officer in the femoral artery as they entered the apartment, and Taylor was struck in the ensuing gunfire.In the 911 call, Walker can be heard crying out Taylor's name and calling for help as he tries to speak to a dispatcher."I don't know what is happening," said Walker, 27. "Somebody kicked in the door and shot my girlfriend."Her death has sparked questions from activists and family members about what led to the fatal shooting and drastically increased pressure on local officials in recent weeks.Police Chief Steve Conrad announced last week he would retire at the end of June, and Fischer has said he's turned over findings of an internal police investigation to the U.S. Attorney's Office and FBI. The FBI has also opened its own independent investigation.The Courier Journal late Tuesday sued the city's police department for records related to the investigation after officials refused to turn them over. Bernard Bradberry, 44, came to the protest with his 16-year-old son, A.J. Hall."We want justice," said A.J., who pushed his father along the downtown streets in a wheelchair.Bradberry said many African Americans in Louisville are angered by more than just Taylor's death."Because of all the other violence going on in the country, too," he said. "All of it's been led up to this."The Louisville protests come less than a day after unrest erupted in Minneapolis in the aftermath of the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody after a white officer pinned him to the ground under his knee.Protests in Minneapolis continued Thursday night, with large crowds also rallying in Phoenix, Denver and Columbus, Ohio.Read more:'It is not a riot. It is a revolt': Councilwoman responds to protestIn downtown Louisville, Bradberry called what he and others see as a lack of police accountability "a slap in the face." "It's like, do they even feel sorry for what they've done?" he asked.Courtney Artis, of Jeffersontown, said she attended the protest because she was "tired of police.” "It's not right that they keep killing black people,” she said. "My parents are from Birmingham, Alabama, and I'm tired of them repeating history. We've been peaceful too long, so that's why we're out here.”Artis said she hoped the protest would pressure officials to charge the officers involved in Taylor's death. "They need to go to jail like anybody else would,” she said. "If I killed somebody, I would get held accountable, right? Right. So, I want them to be held accountable also.”USA TODAY contributed to this report.
