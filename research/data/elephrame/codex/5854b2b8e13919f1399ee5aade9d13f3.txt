"They're scared to press charges or go in to give a report."A series of revelations about alleged police misconduct in Springfield has led to a growing chorus of criticism for the Springfield Police Department.Det. Gregg Bigda was caught on video in February threatening to plant drugs on a juvenile suspect and crush his skull. He was investigated and suspended for 60 days, though the incident was not publicly disclosed until it was reported by The Republican.Ten city councilors have signed a letter calling for more transparency in the case and questioning why Bigda was not fired. Police Commissioner John Barbieri has said that he did not believe a firing would survive civil service arbitration.The Bigda scandal has also harmed prosecution efforts, throwing into chaos drug cases linked to the testimony of Bigda and other officers involved in the incident.On Sunday MassLive reported that 12 Springfield police officers are under investigation for their alleged roles in the beating of a group of men outside Nathan Bill's Bar and Restaurant in April, 2015.The case has referred to the Hampden County District Attorney's Office for investigation, and no disciplinary hearings have yet been held. Once that investigation is complete, it is expected that the accused officers will have hearings before the Community Police Hearing Board.And this week a federal magistrate judge allowed a police brutality lawsuit against the department to move forward, ruling that there was the possibility of systemic problems with how the city responds to complaints of police misconduct.City Councilor Justin Hurst released a statement describing the Community Police Hearing Board, whose seven volunteer members are appointed by Mayor Domenic Sarno and hold hearings on misconduct cases, as a "sham." He is calling for disciplinary powers to be stripped from Barbieri and handed back to a civilian police commission akin to the one which oversaw the department until 2006.Sarno and CBHB Chairman Hector Zavala have both pushed back against the criticism. Sarno said that there was no widespread problem with brutality in the department, and defended the efforts of officers to apprehend sometimes violent suspects."I will once again reiterate I am proud of our Police Department," Sarno said. "This is not systemic, nor symbolic of the men and women in blue who put their lives on the line day in and day out. We ask them to go out there and clean up our streets."And Zavala released a letter saying that the CPHB takes its investigations seriously and works with the department to ensure fair outcomes. Hutchins said that fear and distrust of police officers has led to some residents being unwilling to report crimes or call 911 during emergencies."They're here to protect us, and if we're scared to call them they can't protect us," Hutchins said. "It's hard to call the police because we're not sure what's going to happen or if we're going to be the victim."Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).Â© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
