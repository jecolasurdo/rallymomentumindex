Four officers were injured, including one who suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament, or ACL, in a knee, police Lt. Ed Hasson said. The incident took place about 11:40 a.m. in front of City Hall at West Broad and Front streets near the end of the parade route. Officers used Mace on several protesters during the incident, according to a video provided to The Dispatch by a witness. The protesters' intent was "to create awareness of the lack of spaces for queer people of color in Columbus and the police presence at Pride," said Michaela Mason, 19, an organizer who was not arrested. Stonewall Columbus said in a statement posted on Facebook: "We have contacted the highest city and county officials in order to guarantee (the protesters') safety." The organization also said it was sending legal representation to the arrested individuals. Police identified three of the four arrested as: • Deandre A. Miles, 21, of Atlanta, charged with aggravated robbery after allegedly trying to take an officer's weapon. • Micah P. Jones, 28, of Columbus, charged with resisting arrest. • Ashley N. Braxton, 27, Columbus, charged with resisting arrest. mhenry@dispatch.com @megankhenry jevans@dispatch.com Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you.
