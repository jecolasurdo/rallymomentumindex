"And then I tripped and they picked me up. They tossed me to the fence. They started to spray my face and they started (expletive) stepping on me and stuff.”The man said police did not arrest him but told him to go home. Day 3, George Floyd police brutality protest in DetroitPosted by MLive.com on Sunday, May 31, 2020Other than a few stragglers walking alone or in small groups, and a heave presence of police zipping through the city streets, downtown Detroit was quiet and apparently unscathed, as far as looting, fires or any significant vandalism. Some windows on a federal building that houses FBI offices were covered in boards after being struck with rocks Saturday night.Over the first two nights of protesting, Detroit police reported over 140 arrests, the majority of those being people who live outside the city of Detroit.Minutes before police initially fired tear gas back at police headquarters Sunday, a crowd of several hundred closed in on police wearing riot gear. Nearly 100 officers, some with clumps of white cable-tie-style restraints sprouting from their pockets, stood in a silent row along the front of the Detroit police headquarters wearing face shields or gas masks, strapped with batons, Tasers and guns.Protesters and police at times were only a couple yards apart. A chant of "take a knee, take a knee” broke out.Protesters knelt and urged officers to do the same, as a symbolic display of support for the movement to stop police brutality, especially against people of color.Police stood firm still as helicopters hovered above. One painted in military green, flew just a few hundred feet above the crowd. Faces, presumably those of police, could be seen looking down on the crowd from atop the police parking garage.The protesters eventually broke out in cheers as one Detroit police officer who was speaking to the crowd through a megaphone joined the group in taking a knee.However, the protesters were still not ready to leave the area or abide by the city's curfew order. Some were seen throwing bottles of water at police from the crowd."People were kneeling, we kept hearing a police chief walking up and down, saying, 'Hey, we're going to do gas,'" said Andrew Gaz, 28, of Ypsilanti. "They started putting on their gear. It looked like they were going to come and all the sudden, out of nowhere, they just start running toward us."It was completely unprovoked. At least I didn't see anything on out side.”As police rushed protesters, there was a bang, indicating tear gas had been fired. Police chased and tackled numerous protesters running north on Third Street.At least one group of protesters numbering nearly 100 reformed and began walking down the center of downtown streets, chanting, "No justice, no peace, no racists ass police.” When they turned back toward downtown, numerous police vehicles with flashing lights converged and officers took off on foot, chasing and arresting protesters.Sunday was the third night in a row police and protesters clashed following an otherwise peaceful rally and march against police brutality in the name of George Floyd.Each day, large crowds met at the Detroit police headquarters on Third Street downtown, marched through the city and returned to the police headquarters. On Saturday, protesters were met by a line of police in riot gear blocking the street, which caused some tension and was a precursor to a more violent encounter later the same night.On Sunday, the first day of the curfew imposed by Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, police took a different approach.They allowed protesters to freely return to the police headquarters about 7 p.m., where they sat in the grass and listened to several speakers, including Yasmeen Ali, an 18-year-old from Ecorse whom police arrested Saturday."I woke up this morning with swollen wrists,” said Ali, who was arrested for disorderly conduct. "Last night, I pleaded to five officers to please let me go or my arm was going to break, for screaming 'black lives matter,' for having a sign.”Tristan Taylor, 37, acted as the emcee during a series of speeches before the formal protests concluded just before 8 p.m."We've got brothers and sister here today that were violated by (Detroit police) ... beaten up for doing nothing but standing strong,” Taylor said. "Bullies get really upset when they don't get their way after being used to getting their way."So we have to make sure, ya'll, that we show up and we demand that everyone that was detained, that all charges against them are dropped.”A few minutes later, Taylor said he received word that Detroit Police Chief James Craig wanted to meet with him about dropping all charges against the protesters."This is how sellouts happen,” Taylor said. "When these conversations happen in closed doors, nuh uh."So here's my proposal ... I want to reconvene Wednesday at 4 o'clock and I want Chief Craig to join us so we can have that discussion together as a movement. If he's serious about it, he can bring the mayor too.”More on MLive:MLive photographer struck with rubber pellet84 arrested on second night of protests in DetroitDetroit protest turns violent on second nightGrand Rapids protests turn violent1,500 attend first Detroit protestKalamazoo protests police brutalityWhitmer wants peaceful protest zonesNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
