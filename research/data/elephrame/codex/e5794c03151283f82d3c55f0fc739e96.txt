About five people camped out until 3 a.m. at the George W. Dunne Cook County office building downtown in hopes of forcing Alvarez to step over her handling of the investigation into the Laquan McDonald shooting. Alvarez has been under mounting pressure following the video's release, which shows Chicago officer Jason Van Dyke shooting the 17-year-old a total of 16 times as he walked away from police.

Ahead of Thursday night's sit-in a group of local faith leaders and community members were at the county building delivering a formal petition calling for Alvarez's resignation. The petition had collected more than 32,000 signatures. That same day Alvarez responded to the mounting criticism, saying there was "no way” she would ever "even consider” resigning. "I am going to continue to be Cook County State's Attorney,” she said. 0 Weather ForecastChicago, IL Facebook Twitter Instagram Submit Tips for Investigations Newsletters Connect With Us Send Feedback WMAQ Employment Information Terms of Service Do Not Sell My Personal Information Privacy Policy – New Ad Choices Advertise With Us WMAQ Public Inspection File Copyright © 2020 NBC Universal Inc.
