Rambo | The Oregonian/OregonLive Portlanders converged again Friday night to protest the Minneapolis police killing of a black man that has sparked a wave of national outrage.Thousands of people filled Peninsula Park in North Portland for an evening vigil that lasted three hours. Hundreds then began marching on Rosa Parks Avenue, planning to end at the downtown Portland police headquarters four miles away.The events remained largely peaceful and police remained distant from the protests. But tension escalated as marchers made their way toward downtown. Portland Police labeled the event as an "unlawful assembly” around 11 p.m., as hundreds of marchers congregated outside the Multnomah County Justice Center, which houses the police headquarters. Some demonstrators smashed windows in the building."If you do not go home now, force will be used to disperse you,” Portland police said on Twitter.Update: Protest escalates at downtown Portland justice centerDemonstrations remained largely peaceful Friday until hundreds of marchers converged outside the Multnomah County Justice Center.The Friday night demonstrations were the largest in Portland in response to the death of George Floyd on Monday. Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kneeled on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, as Floyd can be heard on video saying he could not breathe and pleading for help. Chauvin was arrested and charged Friday with third-degree murder in connection with Floyd's death.People of all ages streamed into Peninsula Park Friday to protest the killing. Many carried homemade cardboard signs. One sign said, "He begged for his life. Remember your oath.”Several speakers, mostly people of color, addressed the crowd. They delivered their speeches using a megaphone as they stood in a pavilion where a white banner said, "No justice, no peace.”Jamal Williams, a black Portland resident who said he'd been coming to Peninsula Park all his life, urged white residents to be better allies.He noted hundreds of protesters who gathered at the Oregon Capitol earlier in May to protest Gov. Kate Brown's stay-home orders and wondered aloud, "Where are they for us?”"If all lives mattered, we wouldn't be in this park right now,” Williams said.The gathering is likely among the largest in Oregon since Brown banned large crowds in March to quell the spread of the coronavirus. Large gatherings are still barred.A spokesperson for Brown did not return a message or email Friday regarding the demonstration.Most people who attended Friday night's event wore face masks.The march began around 9 p.m. Organizers announced that the march would conclude at the Multnomah County Justice Center.The crowd marched south on Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard.
