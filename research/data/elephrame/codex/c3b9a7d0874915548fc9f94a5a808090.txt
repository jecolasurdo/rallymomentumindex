By 10:45 p.m., however, the situation had been resolved peacefully with no injuries and no arrests, police said. Officers in riot gear, backed up by a truck, herded the last few dozen protesters off the bridge. They continued pushing the crowd forward down Front Street as most of those gathered eventually dispersed. Memphis Police Department Interim Director Mike Rallings met with several of the protesters, locking arms in solidarity with some of them, and spoke briefly afterward. He also pleaded with the city to stop the killing for 30 days. "The only thing I want in my city is peace. I think we recognize our young people are hurting. It's time for talk," said Rallings. "But I want to hear what these young people have to say. Their voices will not be silent. We're going to have to listen, we're going to have to talk." Mayor Jim Strickland said that despite the peaceful nature, the protest was still illegal. "I appreciate the fact that they've remained peaceful," he said. "But part of the conversations that we are going to have going forward, we have to have protests in a legal way. And stopping traffic on the interstate is not legal." This all began a little before 6 p.m. in front of FedExForum, as about 200 people, nominally associated with the Black Lives Matter movement, gathered to protest the two killings by police. Many shouted slogans or waved placards. "I'm just tired of the senseless killings of black people. That fact that I have two sons, that hits me close to home," said Porshia Scruggs, who came from West Memphis with her sons Isaiah, 7, and Isaac, 6. The event was somewhat chaotic and disorganized, as people just shouted through bullhorns. One man shouted that the killing of five police officers in Dallas was just a hoax. Then, a little before 6:30, the crowd started walking north on Third Street as police blocked off streets to prevent any accidents. The crowd soon turned west and when it reached Front, began walking up the on-ramp to I-40. Police quickly mobilized to try to stop anyone else from going toward the bridge, but by then the crowd had swelled and several hundred were already on I-40. This has become a common tactic with some Black Lives Matter movements around the country. In response to two fatal police shootings of black men this past week in Louisiana and Minnesota, groups in both those states have attempted similar shutdowns. Stephanie Cole was one of those standing at the on-ramp who didn't get to walk up to the bridge. "I have a 16-year-old son. He just got his (driver's) license. I held off letting him get a license just (because of) this," she said, referencing shootings of motorists after being pulled over by police. "You're afraid if he gets pulled over, he's not going to act right. Or the officer is not going to act right." Officers formed a line to keep the remaining protesters at bay. But around 6:45 p.m., a new group of protesters, spurred Downtown by social media and news reports, began walking up another ramp from Riverside Drive. At that point, police relented and allowed those gathered on Front to also walk up the on-ramp. Atop the ramp, police set up a blockade of both squad cars and officers to prevent the protesters from continuing to walk. "I was told not to come," said Dealisia Brye, one of those who saw the protest unfold on social media. "I decided to come anyway. It's peaceful and it's beautiful." During the standoff, Memphis police kept a stern but calm presence as some of the protesters attempted to stir up trouble. However, the vast majority of those gathered remained peaceful. DeAnna Morris had just left her shift at Verizon and was heading back to West Memphis when she got stuck in the traffic. Yet she wasn't too frustrated, she said. "I think it's good that they came together to protest. I do think they could've been a little bit more organized," she said, also adding that she didn't approve of those who climbed on squad cars and the like. "It's not a fun time. If we're going to do this, be serious about it." MPD Deputy Director Mike Ryall led the police response at the scene for most of the night, but as the standoff wore on, Rallings appeared, wearing a Kevlar vest. He, Ryall and others spoke to some of the nominal leaders of the crowd, hoping to reach a resolution. Then, after 8 p.m. the crowd started to thin out, with many leaving the bridge.

That spooked the cops, one of whom suddenly appeared holding a tear gas gun. One of those nominal leaders tried to talk to the crowd over a squad car's speaker, but that went nowhere. The situation soon eased as more of the protesters left the bridge. However, many of those protesters didn't go home, instead camping out at the end of the on-ramp near Front and the Memphis Cook Convention Center. By 9:30 or so, some protesters still remained on the bridge, linking arms in front of the police officers. Around 10:30, the police in riot gear had escorted the remaining protesters off the bridge. Rallings also said the bridge shutdown was not the proper way to protest. "Now, it ain't what I wanted, I don't want us to shut down a bridge. ... I'm with you, I'll march with you. But we need to do it together, we need to have a dialogue, we need not to be shutting down (bridges)," he said. "The demonstration has been had. Now it's time for the conversation."
