CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Protesters marched through downtown Cleveland Tuesday, blocking intersections at rush hour to decry violence by police officers here and around the country.Police made no arrests during the demonstrations, which took marchers and a swarm of officers past several Cleveland landmarks, from City Hall to Public Square to Progressive Field to The Mall.The march was affiliated with a national movement that spread through social media with the hashtag #ShutDownA14.The mostly peaceful march saw a few tense moments, including when protesters locked arms to square off against Cleveland police officers on horseback. The police were trying to move the marchers out of the intersection at East 9th Street and Euclid Avenue during rush hour traffic, but a few protesters defiantly locked arms in the eastbound lanes of Euclid Avenue as others chanted "CPD, what do you say, how many kids have you killed today?"The horses moved in on the demonstrators, who eventually retreated to the sidewalk temporarily. After that, officers used the horses to limit the protestors to blocking traffic only in one direction.Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams said the department's plan was to balance the protesters' freedom of expression with the rights of drivers who were trying to get home after work, to the Indians game or to an appointment.Deputy Chief Wayne "Dornat" Drummond, who declined to comment, followed the marchers. When they blocked the intersection at Carnegie Avenue and Ontario Street for the second time, he gave them a final warning not to block intersections.Throughout the march, protesters broke out in chants that have become ubiquitous with demonstrations against police killings -- like "black lives matter" and "hey hey, ho ho, these killer cops have got to go" -- and frequently yelled and mocked police officers.
