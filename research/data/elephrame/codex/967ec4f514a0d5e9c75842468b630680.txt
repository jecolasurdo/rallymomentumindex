Protesters were lying in downtown Huntsville streets, in reference to Madison Police shooting and killing Dana Fletcher. The arrested protesters, Carlos Chaverst, Brandy McCollum and Garrick Rawls, spent nearly four hours in the Madison County Jail and were charged with disorderly conduct. Even with being arrested, they say it was a success and a statement was made. "Because of the type of bond we used ,we have to show up tomorrow morning for court where we plead guilty or not guilty. All three of us plan to plead not guilty," Carlos Chaversty said. "They lit fire tonight, and so fire is going to met with even more people, even if we have to go to the district attorney's house to protest, sheriff's house, mayor's house." Hours after the arrests, Attorney Benjamin Crump and the Fletcher family spoke for the first time in Huntsville about the death of Dana Fletcher. People that don't even know the family want them to know they have their support. "I've attended the Planet Fitness as well, in Madison, and that could have been me!" Perrion Roberts, who lives in Madison County, said. Roberts says the family speaking out and demanding the truth was powerful. "A grieving family, looking for answers, and a community that is looking for answers, that's what stood out," Roberts said. Chaverst says the death of Fletcher will stay at the forefront of protests and they will go wherever they need to. That's where we will go to allow our voices to be heard and to let them know we need justice for Dana Fletcher and this will never happen in this area again," Chaverst said. Chaverst said there could be another protest on Tuesday, and said they will not stop anytime soon. From earlier: Three protesters were released from the Madison County Jail Monday afternoon, hours after staging a die-in at the Huntsville Veterans Day parade. Carlos Chaverst, Brandy McCollum and Garrick Rawls are charged with disorderly conduct, and have a date with a judge Tuesday. WAAY 31 was there as the three walked out after being released. They told us they have no regrets on what they did, and said this won't be the last you see of them protesting the death of Dana Fletcher. "Release the video and release the call y'all,' Chaverst said. 'We want them to release the original audio of who called the police in addition to the video and we will continue to protest until at least one or the other or both of them are done." In a Facebook Live video posted by Chaverst, you see them walking into the street where they said they staged a die-in for a few minutes. They said a police officer told them to get up, and shortly after the three were arrested. The group's founder, Frank Matthews, said the three were holding a peaceful die-in, and he calls the arrest illegal. He said the police actions in Huntsville mirror the actions of the Madison police officers. "I have two of my people that was conducive into this almost peaceful protest," Matthews said. "They chose to lay down on the streets at this parade - at a veterans parade, who gave up their life for them to have the right to protest, and assemble, and freedom of speech and they're arrested by some cops." WAAY 31 asked the protesters if they knew that staging a die-in in the street was illegal. They told me they had every right to have a peaceful protest and the reason they laid on the street was to represent how Dana Fletcher lay on the ground after being shot by police more than two weeks ago. "We didn't believe it was illegal and still, we'll allow the court to decide whether it was illegal or not," Chaverst said. The ACLU of Alabama says any protest that requires a street closure or blocking the street, does require a permit.The three still do not believe they did anything wrong. The three of them said they'll all plead not guilty in court on Tuesday.
