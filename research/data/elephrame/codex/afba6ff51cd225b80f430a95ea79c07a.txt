After hours of community comment, the council did not bow to the crowd's budget demands.Protesters packed the council chambers Wednesday afternoon on the heels of a heated "community listening session" Tuesday night.The council was not scheduled to discuss the video. It shows Phoenix police officers pointing guns and yelling threats at Dravon Ames, 22, his pregnant fiancee, Iesha Harper, and their two young daughters after the family said their 4-year-old daughter took a doll from a Family Dollar store.CLOSE A bystander shot video of Phoenix police detaining an African-American couple in front of their children. USA TODAY HandoutBut the council was expected to vote on the city's annual budget, which includes hundreds of millions of dollars for the Police Department. That was enough to draw a large crowd and numerous speakers who demanded changes before the council gave more of the public's money to the department.The budget passed 7-2, with Vice Mayor Jim Waring and Councilman Sal DiCiccio voting against it for financial reasons — not because of the audience's request. Mayor Kate Gallego pledged to hold a policy meeting to discuss creating a panel to implement recommendations for police-community relations and a civilian review board of officer conduct, which community advocates have requested for years. Community members were dissatisfied with the mayor's pledge, and more protests are planned for Thursday and Friday.

CLOSE Protesters came out to oppose the additional allocation of funds to the Phoenix Police Department on June 19, 2019, after a viral video. The Republic | azcentral.comThey chanted as they waited, many holding signs denouncing the police action and demanding that officers involved be fired along with other changes."PPD (Phoenix Police Department) is guilty, guilty. The whole damn system's guilty, guilty," went one chant."PPD you can't hide; we can see your racist side," was another.Some held signs: "Film the police," "Fire the cops," "Being Black is not a crime." As he waited in line, Michael Alexander said he hoped the proposed budget would not pass at the meeting."Cops do not deserve any more money — all that money does is contribute to more destroyed lives,” he said. "We need to say 'no more' until we can get together and discuss how to value the lives in the community.”Alexander said that as a black man, he identifies with the Ames family, saying he has felt harassed by police in the past."I know the experiences of being black and being traumatized and terrorized by police,” he said. "This is not something that's unique, or that people can pretend barely happens.”Caitlin Clifford called the family's encounter "absolutely horrifying” but said she hopes it helps people realize the reality people of color face in the city."The entire country is looking at this case right now. Everyone wants to know, do black lives matter in America?”Caitlin Clifford"This is happening in Phoenix, in our city — cops talk like this to citizens over a $4 Barbie doll,” Clifford said.She said she believes the incident will become a "landmark” case and that time will tell if officials respond appropriately."Is the police chief gonna do something? Is the mayor going to make the police chief ... do something?” she said. "Because the entire country is looking at this case right now. Everyone wants to know, do black lives matter in America?”Leslie Pico and her young son held up signs decrying the criminal justice system. They stood along Washington Street as several cars honked in support of their message.Pico said she believes the public should "abolish the police” and that a citizen-led police force should be enacted."I don't care if that family stole everything in that entire dollar store,” she said. "Does that justify an on-demand execution by the police who are supposed to be deescalating the situation?”REPUBLIC ANALYSIS: Every 5 days, an Arizona officer shoots someoneCommunity asks council to fire officersWhen the meeting began, the council quickly proceeded to the vote on its annual budget.The city's $4.42 billion annual budget includes $721 million in funding for the Phoenix Police Department in the next fiscal year, including raises for officers and $2.5 million in new money for the department to fund:10 civilian positions to support a new crime reporting system required by the federal government.13 civilian positions to assist the department's booking process.Seven civilian positions in the Lab Services Bureau to assist with 26,000 backlogged cases. Funding for community response and debriefing after a police shooting. It quickly became clear that most in attendance did not want the budget passed until the council determined a plan to address officer conduct.Ramona Ferrara, of Phoenix, protests recent actions of the Phoenix Police Department, which many view as racist and an example of police brutality. (Photo: Cheryl Evans/The Republic)More specifically, they wanted the officers involved in the viral video fired. "You can't pass this budget," Viri Hernandez told the council. Hernandez leads Poder in Action, a Maryvale-based advocacy group. She said that in addition to firing the officers involved, her group wants the city to immediately adopt a civilian review board with power to subpoena the department and fire officers. For more than three hours, the community shared story after story.Jeffrey Fetterhoff shouts in protest regarding recent actions of the Phoenix Police Department, which many view as racist and an example of police brutality. (Photo: Cheryl Evans/The Republic)Family members of police shooting victims talked about their loved ones. Teachers shared their concerns for their students of color.Children told the council that they were afraid of police officers. Parents told the council they were afraid for their children. Jason Vail Cruz, of the Arizona Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, told the council that police trust is essential for domestic violence victims."Without it, it can cause survivors to stay in situations that would be detrimental to their health," he said.All of them told the council to vote down the budget until they can come back with a plan to address the schism in community-police relations. Formal ask for firingAmes and Harper attended the council meeting, again asking that the police chief fire the officers who arrested them.The Rev. Jarrett Maupin, right, speaks to Iesha Harper and her fiance, Dravon Ames, during a Phoenix City Council meeting. The couple were filmed in a viral video showing Phoenix police officers pointing guns at them after an alleged shoplifting incident. (Photo: Cheryl Evans/The Republic)"I just wanted to say that the police officers that did that to us need to be fired and held accountable because there will not be any change if people are not held accountable," Ames said. The Rev. Jarrett Maupin, an activist who is working with the family, submitted a formal citizen's petition asking the council to direct the city manager to fire the police officers who arrested the couple and demote, suspend without pay and retrain all other officers involved in the situation.Under the city charter, the council has to act on the request within 15 days. Calls for city manager, chief firings and council ousters By the second half of the four-hour meeting, the protesters no longer were just asking for the officers from the video to be fired. They wanted Williams and her boss, City Manager Ed Zuercher, gone too. The mayor and City Council only have firing power over Zuercher.Zuercher is the final decision-maker on firing over all city departments, including the Police Department. Then people in the crowd started shouting out their plans to oust the mayor and council members as well. "You're done, Sal." "Recall Nowakowski." "You're gone too, Kate." Earlier, about 20 minutes into comments from the community, Councilman Sal DiCiccio — a staunch conservative and supporter of the Police Department — spoke up.Councilman Sal DiCiccio, left, exchanges words with the public during a Phoenix City Council meeting regarding the Phoenix Police Department and police brutality. (Photo: Cheryl Evans/The Republic)He said he needed to "push back" because he wanted the media to know that "not everybody in the city believes this crap." The chamber erupted in "boos," drowning out the rest of what the councilman said. The crowd chanted, "Whose council? Our council," and for a moment it looked like the orderly meeting would unravel. But within five minutes, the crowd went back to taking turns to address the council.Newly elected Councilman Carlos Garcia previously led a migrants-rights advocacy group that has been critical of the Phoenix Police Department's conduct in the past. Wednesday was his first formal council meeting. "It's my first time here," he said coyly after listening to hours of testimony. He received whopping applause from the crowd — many of whom he'd worked with during similar protests in the past. He said he knows the viral-video incident is not the first situation of its kind but a continuation of a pattern of conduct by Phoenix police. He also said the city has previously committed to considering reforms of the department: most notably, a civilian review board made up of experts and victims that has the ability to subpoena the department and recommend that officers be fired."I think we've lacked the will to actually follow through and implement these things," he said. He asked for an ad hoc committee to implement recommendations and the civilian review board. After Gallego committed to holding a meeting to move forward with both groups, he agreed to vote for the budget. Some in the audience felt betrayed. "It's deferred action," Michael Alexander said after the meeting. Mayor's first controversyThis is the first major controversy in Phoenix since Gallego was elected mayor in March.On Saturday, two days after the now-viral video began circulating, she issued a statement apologizing for the officers' behavior. She also called for a community meeting and announced that the city would speed up deployment of its body camera program, outfitting nearly all officers by the end of summer.The "community listening session" on Tuesday lasted three hours. At the end, Gallego, who was joined by Police Chief Jeri Williams and other city officials, said the city would take the comments and come back with recommendations in 30 days.With Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego to her left, Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams gives the OK sign to a friend before the beginning of a public meeting about a controversial viral video, at the Pilgrim Rest Baptist Church in Phoenix, June 18, 2019. (Photo: Darryl Webb/Special for The Republic)That comment was not well received. Several speakers called the meeting a sham and a waste of time.On Wednesday, local activist JJ Johnson chastised Gallego for failing to mention the conflict between the Police Department and the community in her State of the City address last week. "You laid a giant Crest white strip across the city and you bleached us," Johnson said. "It was shameful, and I didn't expect that from you." Many protesters called out Gallego directly, saying they were disappointed to have voted for her. They asked for her to act — and promptly. They wanted her to direct the city manager to fire the police chief and officers involved in the viral video. They also asked her to fire the city manager. "If the mayor does not fire the chief, you needs to go," one resident said to a roaring response. CLOSE The Arizona Republic studied data spanning eight years on police shootings across Arizona.
