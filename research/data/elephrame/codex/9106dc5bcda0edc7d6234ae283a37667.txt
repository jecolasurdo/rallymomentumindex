"I want to thank all of the peaceful protesters. There were no problems. I'm also relieved that there were no outside agitators who showed up to either harass peaceful protesters or cause destruction of property.”Police Chief Odis B. Rogers added that he talked with organizers before and after the protests."I thanked them for being peaceful and exercising their rights in a very respectful way,” Rogers said.It wasn't until after the Thursday protest that Rogers said he learned of not only another larger protest scheduled for Saturday, but also plenty of angry social media chatter."That's when I started thinking there may be quite a few people on Saturday,” Rogers said. "We reached out to area agencies -- such as SEB (Southwest Enforcement Bureau), Cuyahoga County and the Ohio State Highway Patrol -- to make sure they knew what was going on."There were multiple protests across Northeast Ohio on Saturday, and all resources were stretched thin. So reaching out to multiple agencies was a necessity to make sure that we had enough people to keep everybody safe," Rogers said.Both Graven and City Council President Paul Stibich mentioned the cost of city police officer overtime related to the Saturday protest."We're focused on finances right now, already trying to figure out how we're going to balance the budget for this year,” Stibich said. "Now we're taking another hit with funding for this thing.”Despite receiving criticism for having a large police officer presence, the mayor defended his decision."Not knowing what to expect, I chose to provide the best safety for our businesses and residents,” Graven said. "I'm very grateful that no violence occurred during our (Saturday) protest, and I'm also thankful that we were prepared for anything that may have come as a result."This is the same decision I would make every day of the week. I owe it to our community to keep them safe," he said.As for the Olmsted Falls Police Department, Rogers said his officers watched and discussed the video of Floyd's death, which showed a Minnesota police officer pressing a knee to Floyd's neck for nearly 9 minutes."Every officer on the Olmsted Falls Police Department has seen that video and was disgusted by it,” Rogers said. "No officer in this country is going to see that and think that that was OK. Having said that, I'm incredibly proud to be a police officer. That's not going to be taken away from me or any of my officers."I'm proud of each and every one of my officers for the way they handle themselves every day, every shift, every call," Rogers said."We haven't had these kinds of issues here because this is something we care about. This is something we're trained on.”Read more news from the Sun Post Herald.
