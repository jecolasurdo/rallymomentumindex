"No justice, no peace, no racist police," was a common phrase repeated throughout the day. The group started gathering after 10 a.m. and left after 2 p.m."The protest is to hold police accountable for their actions," said Tim Shipe, a Nexus employee.He was one of many Nexus employees who gathered that day, mostly to protest the treatment of one of their own — Theodore Whitelow, who had been charged by the Augusta County Sheriff's Office with obstruction of justice, a misdemeanor charge. Shipe said the focus of the protest was treatment from the Augusta County Sheriff's Office. Some of the chanting was asking for people to remove Sheriff Donald Smith from office and that the "Augusta County Sheriff is corrupt."According to Shipe, Thursday was his court hearing. Whitelow works for Nexus Entertainment's "Breaking Through," which is Nexus' own news source. The protest was called "Justice for Theo" and according to a statement from Nexus, the company accuses the sheriff's office of lying under oath and having Whitelow's due process rights to appeal the case eliminated after a judge deferred adjudication. "This result does not advance the interests of justice, and fails to hold the police accountable for their abusive behavior," the statement from Nexus said. "Nexus is considering funding a civil lawsuit to afford Theodore an opportunity to prosecute his claims against the police."About NexusNexus, through its Libre by Nexus arm, helps post bond through third-party licensed bondsmen with federally-approved insurance companies for people being held in immigration detention centers while they await their court case.
