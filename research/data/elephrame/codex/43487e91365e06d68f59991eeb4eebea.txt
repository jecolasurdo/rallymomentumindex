Instead of demonstrating at City Hall, however, organizers decided to rally at the intersection of Foothill Boulevard and Haven Avenue. There, they made speeches and held a moment of silence for victims of police brutality, before marching the roughly three miles back to the starting point. The demonstration, which grew as it went on, had been scheduled from noon to 5 p.m., beginning at the southeast corner of 4th Street and Milliken Avenue. Protesters began to march up Milliken Avenue just before 1 p.m. Approximately 300 peaceful #protesters have gathered at the corner of Haven and Foothill in #RanchoCucamonga after marching from the Ontario Mills mall #GeorgeFloydProtests pic.twitter.com/JJklUlfVlU — Will Lester (@WillLesterPhoto) June 6, 2020 Kimberly Lopez, a 20-year-old Ontario resident and psychology student at Chaffey College, was the organizer. "Our overarching theme is that the community support each other,” Lopez said. "We as citizens and residents need to stand up for each other and that it's possible to do that in a peaceful way.” Two Ontario police officers approached Lopez as the demonstration began. One shook her hand and asked her what the group's plans were as far as marching and how long they would be here. They then smiled, thanked Lopez, and drove away. Police gathered at the Rancho Cucamonga City Hall parking lot to prevent demonstrators from marching there. They did not say why they wouldn't let protesters enter. Lopez said she and another organizer changed their destination before they knew police were present. Except for that, police presence was minimal. In contrast with some othe cities, businesses did not appear to be boarded up or closed in anticipation of the protest, which had been announced on social media.

George Floyd protests raise Juneteenth's profile across Southern California Atlanta officer who shot Rayshard Brooks charged with felony murder Aunt Jemima brand retired by Quaker due to racial stereotype; Uncle Ben's 'evolving' Senate GOP proposes policing changes in 'Justice Act' Jordan Anderson, 29, of Rialto, said he coaches youth sports and his dad was an officer. He said police shot two of his friends to death, hitting one with 15 bullets. "This is real life for me,” Anderson said. "I want my dad to come home and I want my friends to come home, so I will keep fighting until the day I die for this.” Anderson added that deaths such as Floyd's can be avoided if more police chiefs police their own officers. And "a black cop and non-racist white cop must speak out” when they see wrongdoing by other officers, he said. "You know the difference between right and wrong,” Anderson said. "We need the police to learn the difference.” Aaron Dill, 24, of San Bernardino, was among the marchers. "We need to come together and love and show support for George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and countless others,” Dill said. He said he'd like to see protesters drill down on a united message going forward. "We need to have elected officials work for our best interests and we need to hold them accountable,” Dill said. Dill, who is black, added: "It's great to see so many races and backgrounds (here).” As they marched, the group's chants included "Black Lives Matter” and the names of two black people who have died at the hands of police, George Floyd and Breonna Taylor. Protests across the nation have taken a stand against police brutality in the past two weeks, with nearly three dozen planned in Southern California on Saturday. They follow the death of Floyd, 46, who died in Minneapolis police custody late last month, after now-former office Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes, an incident captured on video. Chauvin and three other now-fired officers implicated in the case face criminal charges. Taylor, a black woman who worked as an emergency room technician, was fatally shot by police who forced entry to her apartment March 13 in Louisville, Ky.
