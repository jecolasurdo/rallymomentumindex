But his name has become nationally known in the days since the unarmed black teenager died on a street in St. Louis suburb Ferguson after being shot multiple times by a white police officer.About 60 people gathered in downtown Savannah on Saturday morning to make sure their voices were heard on the matter.Called March on Bay Street, the event was organized by students from Savannah State University and was meant to protest police brutality and racial injustice.Holding signs with a variety of slogans, protesters marched from Reynolds Square along Bay Street, then went into City Market, walked on Broughton Street and ended back on Bay Street.The Aug. 9 shooting of Brown in Ferguson sparked protests - several met with police in riot gear armed with assault weapons - and has raised questions nationwide about racial discrimination and police brutality.Demonstrations of solidarity with the protesters have been held in several cities across the country, including Atlanta, since protesting in Ferguson and a federal investigation into Brown's death became national news. Until Saturday, no such events had been held in Savannah."I came to support the cause for Mike Brown," said Khalil Brooks, a 20-year-old student at Savannah State. "It's really bad how a lot of black people or males in general are really just being treated this way by police officers. To me, it's not something I want to see around this world so I came out to support the cause to end this violence."Savannah State students Ja'Andra Wheeler and Ayana Tiller, who organized the event, said they thought it went well."We're very happy with the outcome," Tiller said. "Reach one person, touch a life - that's what matters most."Student Cytra Kinte, 18, said she liked to see people unify."I like to be a part of the movement," she said. "I want to make sure I don't just stand by. There's nothing worse than a bystander."Savannah-Chatham police and officers from the university were present during the protest, which was peaceful.From 5-8 p.m. Monday, Savannah State will host a talk about police brutality and social injustices in room 115 of its Social Sciences Building. Wheeler, Tiller and the president of the school's student NAACP chapter will participate. Presentations will be made by Daai'yah Salaam, founder and CEO of Community Works Inc., Francys Johnson, president of the Georgia NAACP and Savannah State graduate Calvert Smith Jr. The event is open to the public.
