The players said Wolfe's unresponsiveness to complaints from black students showed he didn't care about the issues they faced on campus."We, the black community at Eastern Michigan University, stand in solidarity with the Concerned Student 1950 and the black students, staff and faculty of the University of Missouri. We, the black community at Eastern Michigan University, would like to extend our deepest sentiments to those who are unheard, under-supported, and unwanted at the University of Missouri," said one of the speakers at the EMU rally."We open our arms in support and solidarity with you in the face of institutionalized racism and are committed to situating ourselves in the battlefields...until justice is served nationwide."Concerned Student 1950 is the organization at Missouri that has led many of the protests. The organization's name comes from the year that the university accepted its first black student.The speaker at the EMU rally, who declined to give his name to a reporter said the social climate at EMU is also difficult for black students."We, too, struggle to succeed and thrive in a university because of overt and covert racism ingrained in many faculty, staff, students and alumni. We understand because we have also not seen adequate recognition, support, defense and investments in eradicating racism at Eastern Michigan University," he said."To the black students at Mizzou, we applaud you for your resilience and appreciate your bravery, dedication and persistence, as you have inspired a nation of people to be activists in the fight for social change and equality."Geoff Larcom, a spokesman for Eastern, stood in the stairwell of Welch Hall as the protesters marched into the building.Larcom said that the university respects the students' voices and their right to peacefully protest anything they want."We support our students speaking out in a peaceful manner on issues that are important to them," he said."These are public buildings and I'm sure our students will be respectful."The march followed an assembly on the University of Michigan campus Wednesday night when about 150 people gathered at the Diag for a similar cause.Just before Thursday's march, Eastern Michigan's interim president Kim Schatzel sent a campuswide email about the civil unrest on the campus of Missouri.In the email, Schatzel said because a broad discussion about institutional racism across America needs to take place, the school will host a public forum on the topic.The program will take place Thursday, Nov. 19, from 12-1:30 p.m. in the auditorium of the Student Center. The program is being coordinated by Eastern's Faculty Senate, the Office of Campus Life and Eastern Michigan University Student Government."At Eastern Michigan University, we have always taken pride in our efforts to support and promote a diverse student body and community. We are deeply committed to creating the best possible environment - one that is free from racism and racist incidents," Schatzel wrote."While we work to address any issues or problems if and as they occur, we would be naive to believe that there are not elements and individuals in our community who might exhibit racist opinions and actions. This sort of behavior and conduct, when and if it occurs, is not reflective of the culture we seek to have in place at our university. It is not acceptable nor will it be tolerated."The message also announced the creation of a Bias Reporting System, similar to that of Ohio State University's system, which will address "acts or behaviors motivated by bias against age, ancestry, color, disability, gender identity or expression, genetic information, HIV/AIDS status, military status, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or veteran status," OSU's system says.Ohio State's policy continues: "While these acts do not necessarily rise to the level of a crime, a violation of state law, university policy, or the Student Code of Conduct, a bias act may contribute to creating an unsafe, negative, or unwelcome environment for the victim; anyone who shares the same social identity as the victim; and/or community members of the University."EMU Associate Vice President of Student Affairs Calvin Phillips will lead a committee to develop the program and to have it in place by the middle of the winter semester.Jeremy Allen is the higher education reporter for The Ann Arbor News.
