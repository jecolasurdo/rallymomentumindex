They staged the peaceful gathering eight days after the May 25 death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, a handcuffed, unarmed black man who died while in police custody.For 8 minutes and 46 seconds, Floyd begged for air as former police officer Derek Chauvin lodged a knee in his neck on hard asphalt. Two minutes and 53 seconds of that time happened after Floyd's body was unresponsive.A video that a 17-year-old woman captured of the agonizing, nearly, nine minutes sparked the wave of national and, in recent days, international protests. Floyd's death followed two others in 2020: Ahmaud Arbery on Feb. 23 and Breonna Taylor on March 13."This particular death, this George Floyd death, has touched everybody around the globe,” said Swampscott resident Evelyn Foleke after she led chants. "Until we all come out, make noise, seek justice and make our collective voices heard, we will never have peace in this country.”Over 300 attendThe demonstration in downtown Swampscott unified over 300 people when organizers expected under 100. But a diverse crowd materialized as people from Salem, Marblehead, Lynn and Nahant turned out shortly before and after 4 p.m.Swampscott resident Marley Schmidt said she and a half-dozen other organizers, including Mary Brennan, Elizabeth Delia, Maddie Schmidt, Mercy Schmidt, Mary Kate Donovan and Tabitha Randell, endeavored to give young people "space to engage in activism” when they planned the Tuesday protest."For the past couple decades, it has been older activists to create and push for social justice since they were activists in the 1960s,” Schmidt said. "It's our turn to take on the torch.”The message of demonstrators focused on justice for Floyd and other victims of police brutality, Schmidt said. She added that a long-term goal is police reform from training on de-escalation tactics to more accountability around police transgressions.People gathered in spots around the intersection where Lynn Shore Drive, Humphrey Street and Monument Avenue meet. Many stood on the traffic island, on which stands the Swampscott Civil War Memorial, overlooking King's Beach.A steady flow of traffic honked as drivers passed sign-holding demonstrators lining both sides of Lynn Shore Drive nearly to the Swampscott-Lynn line. Protesters held up signs with messages written on posters, cardboard and even blocks of wood, and some read: "White silence is violence," "Enough is enough," "My skin is not a weapon,” "No justice, no peace" and "I can't breathe.” One read: "Stop killing black people.”Silence is complicitySwampscott resident Toyah Pass, a Fordham University student and local Class of 2017 graduate, offered prepared remarks. She stood atop a Linscott Park bench before a rows-deep crowd.She opened saying a lot of hurt, anger and sadness currently exists in the black community."I encourage you to be extra kind to your black friends in this moment to reach out to them and to check on them because we are hurting,” she said.Pass said the country is literally in the middle of an ongoing movement that did not start eight days ago but rather years ago. She urged white people to stay engaged."You posted about Black Lives Matter on your social media accounts. But that is just the beginning of this fight,” she said. "Ask yourself what you can do to take it further. Listen to your black friends. Listen to the black community. Make space for us and our voices. Protect us in the workplace, in school and in our neighborhoods.”Silence perpetuates injustices, violence and racism against black people, she said."When you hear and see micro-aggressions, don't stay silent. Speak up. Following a crowd chanting Black Lives Matter is easy,” she said. "But I challenge you to keep chanting even if you're the only one because that is how you fight for change.”Peabody residents Rachel and Jarron Randall and their toddlers, Elijah and Jeremiah, took in the scene steps away from the Civil War memorial."It gives you hope for the future,” said Jarron Randall of the youthful crowd. "I was telling my wife earlier: 'This is the future of our country right here.'”At the demonstration's halfway point, everybody knelt for 8 minutes and 46 seconds as a man led the sea of demonstrators in chants, his voice amplified by a megaphone: "I can't breathe,” "I can't breathe.” "I can't breathe.” Sign up for weekly e-mails Site ServicesSupport Local BusinessesMy ProfileWork for UsSubscribeAdsPhoto reprintsContact UsPay Your Ad BillMarket PlaceHomesClassifiedsCommunity InfoAbington Town Web siteAbington Public SchoolsAbington Police DepartmentAbington Public LibraryDyer Memorial LibraryIsland Grove ParkAbington Park & RecreationCommunitiesThe Patriot LedgerThe EnterpriseWickedLocal RocklandWicked Local BraintreeWicked Local CohassetWicked Local Duxbury © Gannett Co., Inc. 2020.
