(Photo: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINEMAILMOREChanting "No justice, no peace" and "Black Lives Matter," about 150 protesters braved the cold Monday night and marched through the streets of Dearborn, demonstrating against the police shooting death of Kevin Matthews.Led by the family of Matthews, 35, and the Rev. Charles Williams II of the National Action Network, the protesters called for justice in the Dec. 23 shooting of Matthews, who was unarmed when he was killed by a Dearborn police officer in Detroit near the city's border with Dearborn.Williams and others called for an economic boycott, saying people should not do business in Dearborn until justice is served in the case."We will not be spending dollars in Dearborn," Williams said. "No justice, no dollars."The demonstrators started in the parking lot of a Kroger grocery store, then marched on Michigan Avenue to the Dearborn police station. Dearborn police trailed the protesters, who temporarily shut down traffic along Michigan near Greenfield. They carried placards that read "We Want Justice For All" and "We Demand Human Rights."Outside the station, they chanted: "Hey hey, ho ho, these racist cops have got to go."CLOSE Demonstrators march in Dearborn to protest the fatal police shooting of Kevin Matthews, 35, of Detroit. The rally was peaceful, but there were some tensions afterward when Dearborn police officers surrounded a small group of chanting protesters in the Kroger parking lot, telling them to disperse because it was private property. The protesters argued with the police for a few minutes before leaving.The rally included leaders with Christian, Muslim, labor and other groups. It was organized by the Detroit chapter of the National Action Network, an organization led by the Rev. Al Sharpton.The mother of Matthews, Valerie Johnson, and Matthews' brother were at the front of the rally.Johnson told a throng of reporters she wants to "get justice for my son."Protest pauses on Michigan, which is emptied of traffic @freeppic.twitter.com/TaqqHmYXwe— Daniel Bethencourt (@_dbethencourt) January 4, 2016"No justice, no peace" #kevinmatthewspic.twitter.com/h0IQPRKKoV— Niraj Warikoo (@nwarikoo) January 4, 2016Police should "protect and serve, not kill and maim," said Millie Hall of Detroit, who was with the Coalition of Labor Union Women. "You make a wrong gesture, a wrong glance, you could be a victim."Bishop D.B. Walker of Detroit said he's tired of police shootings of African Americans."It constantly keeps on happening again and again," said Walker, with Burning Bush Ministries International in Detroit. He said he has doubts about the police account of what happened to Matthews."It stinks. It sounds like a lie," he said.Williams told the Free Press after the rally: "We have to shut Dearborn down ... to send a message about how we feel about police brutality."Civil rights activists have complained for decades that African Americans are profiled by Dearborn police. A USA TODAY report in 2014 said that black people are arrested by Dearborn police at a rate 26 times that of whites, one of the highest racial gaps in the U.S.Williams compared Dearborn to Ferguson, Mo., the site of the 2014 police shooting of unarmed 18-year-old Michael Brown, who was also black. He noted that they are both suburbs where African Americans have complained of being targeted.DETROIT FREE PRESSPolice: Officer involved in shooting on leaveDearborn Police Chief Ron Haddad has said the shooting took place after there was a struggle between Matthews and a police officer over the officer's gun. Matthews was wanted on a probation violation warrant and had committed a larceny earlier in the day, Dearborn police said.Detroit Police James Craig said that Matthews was "a crime problem." Matthews' family said he was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia and wouldn't harm anyone.Williams criticized Craig for his remarks about Matthews, saying that there was "a demonization of Kevin Matthews over some misdemeanors."At the protest, Aaron McCarthy, with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said: "Enough is enough. ... Anyone who is unarmed, you don't shoot them."The head of the Michigan chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Dawud Walid, and Rashida Tlaib, who is with Take on Hate, formed by an Arab-American group, also took part in the rally.Dearborn attorney Majed Moughni attended to show his support."There is a victim here, and by appearing at this protest, we are giving him a voice," Moughni said. "The protests will never bring the victim back, but they will put pressure on authority so this injustice will never be repeated again."@freep@nwarikoo Aaron McCarthy, Detroit activist, tells reporters before the rally: "When is enough enough?" pic.twitter.com/oBpxtqDcMg— Daniel Bethencourt (@_dbethencourt) January 4, 2016Tonight's protest was the third held in Dearborn since Matthews' death.On Christmas Day, more than 100 protesters led by New Era Detroit shut down Michigan Avenue in at least two locations. Dressed in black and chanting "black power," they also marched through residential streets and in front of the Dearborn police station, according to videos they posted of the demonstrations."We're not going for this BS no more," New Era Detroit's leader, Zeke, said at the rally, according to a video posted of the protest. "They had no reason to be in the city of Detroit."The following day, on Dec. 26, another rally was held outside the Dearborn police station by the Change Agent Consortium, led by the Rev. David Bullock of Detroit. There have also been vigils head in Detroit near where the shooting took place.Haddad told the Free Press last month: "This incident is tragic for this entire community. I want to be clear about this — that by this entire community, I mean all of southeastern Michigan, including Dearborn and the Dearborn Police Department."He added that "it would be my hope that this incident does not divide our community in any way, but we continue to stand together until it's resolved."Contact Niraj Warikoo: nwarikoo@freepress.com, 313-223-4792 or on Twitter @nwarikooCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://on.freep.com/1R8gPFuFind JobsShare your feedback to help improve our site experience!
