Each of the demonstrators is charged with two counts of disorderly conduct, a violation, and will be arraigned at 9:30 a.m. Monday in Rochester City Court.The protest started as a rally about 4 p.m. at Washington Square Park, but developed into a march that meandered through areas of downtown. A few minutes later, demonstrators shut down the intersection of of South Union and East Broad streets.By about 6 p.m. the marchers had shut down the intersection of Monroe Avenue and Howell Street next to Strong Museum.They later moved to South Clinton Avenue, where police shut down the off ramp to Clinton Avenue from Interstate 490 and redirected traffic. A few protesters remained locked arm-in-arm, seated in the intersection South Clinton Avenue and Woodbury Street.The Rochester Police Department issued warnings in English and Spanish in an attempt to disperse demonstrators from the roadway. "You are hereby ordered to leave the area," police stated.Police then surrounded members of the group who remained sitting in a circle on South Clinton Avenue and began making arrests. Members of the Rochester Police Department's tactical unit formed another circle around the officers who were surrounding the protesters. Officers in riot gear were wearing helmets and were armed with non-lethal weapons. The intersection remained closed for nearly two hours.Protesters said they have repeatedly invited police and city officials to sit and communicate with them. They said their requests have been ignored. Organizers from Black Lives Matter Roc declined to speak with media. Instead, they said they would only speak with Open Mic Roc, a Rochester-based online black magazine."This is basically disobedience," one of the protesters said over a megaphone. "We're not harming anyone."Another protester added, "I love black people. I love being black. We need to empower each other. White people need to be spectators."At the first two stops, protesters wrote chalk messages on the roadways and did chalk outlines of fellow demonstrators to signify the black lives impacted by police violence.On South Clinton Avenue, a small group of protesters blocked a portion of the road with traffic cones and sat in the middle of the street near Geva Theatre. The theater's front door was locked and officers led theatergoers into a side door for an 8 p.m. performance of Million Dollar Quartet.While the demonstrators were gathered on South Clinton, they engulfed a blue Ford sedan with two occupants that was unable to get through the intersection.At 6:45 p.m., Deputy Chief La'Ron Singletary of the Rochester Police Department sent an email alert to media that "police are going to start to provide warnings of possible arrests of protesters that are not going to disperse from the area of the vehicle that is being surrounded."Warnings were issued over a loud speaker and the vehicle was able to leave the area by backing up down South Clinton Avenue.After the arrests were made, the remaining demonstrators moved back to Washington Square Park.As officers descended, one of the protesters asked those gathered, "Who is ready to get arrested?" Officers methodically cleared the intersection, handcuffing demonstrators one-by-one and taking them to a Monroe County Sheriff's Office van. This protest comes nearly two years to the date of a larger Black Lives Matter rally in Rochester, where 74 people were arrested.That 2016 protest started at the Liberty Pole in downtown Rochester and ended hours later after protesters shut down traffic in the East End.It took 112 officers, including state police and members of town police departments, three hours to clear the area, Rochester Police Chief Michael Ciminelli said in 2016.No officers or demonstrators were injured in the 2016 protest.
