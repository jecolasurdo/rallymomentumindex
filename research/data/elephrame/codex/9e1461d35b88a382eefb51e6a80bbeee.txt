(AP Photo/Ben Margot)(Ben Margot)San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was not feeling the love as he took the field at Levi's Stadium, but New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was.Fans booed Kaepernick as he took the field, while they cheered Brady, according to several reports.The Kaepernick-Brady game at New England in 2012 was... rainy... with roars for the Patriots. This sorta feels like that.— Tim Kawakami (@timkawakami) November 20, 2016 Colin Kaepernick takes the field to some boos. Could be due to the large Patriots contingent here today.— Kevin Duffy (@KevinRDuffy) November 20, 2016 Mix of boos and cheers as Colin Kaepernick runs onto the field. He's not the most popular QB on the field today.— Doug Kyed (@DougKyed) November 20, 2016 Yes. This is an away game technically. pic.twitter.com/kqjQWQmy9X— Ann Killion (@annkillion) November 20, 2016 Kaepernick and Brady both drew attention for their political views this election season. Kaepernick led a trend of athletes kneeling for the national anthem in a silent protest against social injustices, while Brady was connected with republican nominee and now president-elect Donald Trump. Kaepernick didn't vote in the election.Kaepernick could have been booed for a number of reasons, along with the political ones. He has the 26th best passer rating in the league (82.2) and is 0-4 in four starts this season. The 49ers are 1-8 on the year, and fans are likely frustrated with the poor performance.Meanwhile, Brady could have been cheered for a number of reasons. The Patriots quarterback is from San Mateo, California, and grew up a 49ers fan, which makes this game a homecoming for him. Plus, it looked like there was a large contingent of Patriots fans at the game.Either way, the Patriots have turned this road game across the country into an atmosphere that is not too different from a home game, which is a pretty special accomplishment.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
