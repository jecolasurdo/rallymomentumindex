Alston, who has filed a lawsuit over the incident, contends he has been ostracized by the department for his complaints.The town's investigation found that his supervisor, Lieutenant Paul R. Pender, was not directing his comments toward Alston but toward a driver on the road at the time Pender was leaving Alston a phone message.Many of the protestors held signs supporting Alston."I love this support," he said. "I refuse to be considered a problem because I spoke up."He and the other protesters marched silently along the sidewalk down Harvard Street, holding signs that read "Black Lives Matter" and "White Parents: Talk to Your Kids About Racism."Liam Oberholzer, 17, came with friends and held a sign that read, "Open Eyes to the Reality of Black Lives."Advertisement"Racism is a problem, even in liberal Brookline," he said. About 400 people attended a separate "Peaceful Sidewalk Vigil" in Arlington on Sunday afternoon.Members of the community gathered at the four corners of Massachusetts Avenue and Pleasant Street for a "secular and peaceful event" to stand in solidarity with other Black Lives Matter demonstrations, said Bonie Bagchi Williamson, co-chair of the Arlington Vision 2020 Diversity Task Group and one of the organizers of the event."Our goal was . . . to make sure we do something and not to stay quiet, because there are families of color in Arlington as well and we wanted to give the town a forum, a place to allow feelings and allow for conversation," she said.The Arlington Police Department said the protest was "quick and quiet." Bagchi Williamson said the protesters had included police in the discussions of planning the vigil.There were several speakers at the event and the vigil ended with the group singing "We Shall Overcome," she said.David Abel can be reached at dabel@globe.com.
