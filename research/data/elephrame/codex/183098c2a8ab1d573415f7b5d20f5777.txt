Robert E. Lee. The rally was met by counter protesters. A car drove into a crowd of counter protesters, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and injuring others. A pair of Virginia state troopers also died when a police helicopter crashed while monitoring the protests. Among those at the vigil were Gail Cirlin-Lazerus, who was there with her two children, Faith and Cole Lazerus, 11 and 8, respectively, and mother, Norma Cirlin, all of New City."Now that the kids are getting older, we want them to understand a lot of things about what's happening in the world,” Cirlin said.USA TODAY: President's 'many sides' comments draw criticismUSA TODAY: 'People need to stop hating,' father of Charlottesville victim Heather Heyer saysSWASTIKAS: Its use is on the rise, but among those who understand it leastCirlin-Lazerus said she'd expected a larger turnout."In the realm of how many people we have in Rockland, and how diverse we are, it would be nice to see thousands,” she said.Lori Safferman said she was driving with her daughter, Rachel Vermeulen, 32, when they spotted the vigil and decided to participate.As a daughter of Holocaust survivors, Safferman said she was "enraged” and "scared for this county” to watch the parading of Nazi symbols over the weekend in Charlottesville.Officials and political figures also weighed in. County Executive Ed Day posted a statement on Facebook Sunday that said, in part: "Hate has no place in Virginia or Rockland County or anywhere in our great nation. White supremacists, white nationalists, Nazis, neo-Nazis and all other hate groups are not welcome in our community."Some took issue with Trump's initial statements condemning the violence and bigotry "on many sides." The White House, in a follow-up statement Sunday, condemned white supremacists.Maureen Porette, a Stony Point Democrat challenging Day, a Republican, in November, attended the vigil and said the events in Charlottesville were a failure of leadership by Trump. "White supremacy was never addressed by the president to begin with. ... And this has given people, in their minds, permission to do exactly what happened in Charlottesville," Porette said.
