Some Bonnabel High School football players kneel during the national anthem. Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save The searing national controversy over the shooting of black men by police, and the way that people choose to protest those shootings, arrived at a high school football game in Jefferson Parish last week.Several members of the Bonnabel High School team and cheerleading squad on Friday took a knee as the national anthem was played before a game, inspired by the example of Colin Kaepernick, the San Francisco 49ers quarterback who began kneeling during the anthem at NFL games last month. In response, some of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office deputies who typically provide security at high school games decided they would take a stand of their own, declining to work voluntary shifts at future Bonnabel games.

But the exchange of views has captured in miniature a debate that has rippled across every level of America's most popular sport in the wake of Kaepernick's protest. "These kids are following Colin Kaepernick's footsteps, and (the deputies) are frustrated with the situation," Sheriff Newell Normand said. "But like anything else, there are some people who feel more strongly about it than others."The sheriff noted that some of his deputies, out of principle, already do not work details at certain events, such as concerts for particular artists who have espoused views they find offensive. Paid details are off-duty shifts that many officers take on to supplement their income."There's not an issue of having adequate security at the game," Normand said. "It's a voluntary detail."Kaepernick, who continues to kneel during games, says he is protesting police brutality. Since he began refusing to stand for the anthem, there have been more high-profile police shootings of black men in the U.S., including in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and Charlotte, North Carolina. They followed a police shooting closer to home, when Alton Sterling was killed by a police officer in Baton Rouge in July.It is unclear whose decision it was for the Bonnabel players and cheerleaders to protest.Bonnabel head coach Reggie Rogers and Principal Dawn Kalb didn't return calls seeking comment.Ernest Williams III, whose son Ernest Williams IV plays for Bonnabel, asked his son about the protest after the game."He said, 'Dad, we're tired,' ” the elder Williams said. "These kids have social media, and they have access to what's going on. They see all the stuff on the news and they are getting fed up.”Williams was unsure if the protest would continue this week."We've talked to our attorneys, and they have a right to their demonstration,” said Beth Branley, a spokeswoman for Jefferson Parish Public Schools. "And we will not take any disciplinary action against those students.”Likewise, Normand said deputies are fully within their rights to boycott the game, "just as the kids have the First Amendment right to express their own views."Bonnabel's protest is believed to be the first one by a high school team in the New Orleans area.The New Orleans Saints made a statement during their game against the Atlanta Falcons on Monday night, but it occurred immediately after the anthem. Players from both teams formed a large circle and joined hands.Staff writer Jim Mustian contributed to this report. Follow Rod Walker on Twitter, @rwalkeradvocate.
