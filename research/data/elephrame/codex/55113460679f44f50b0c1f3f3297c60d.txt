In a sign of the tensions laid bare by Floyd's death, Teaneck saw two, rival demonstrations on Friday. The groups were divided by their willingness to include local officials in the demonstration, said several participants.The protest sanctioned by Teaneck officials and sponsored by Black Lives Matter, began at Bryant Elementary School with emotional speeches by organizers as well as Thelma Pannell-Dantzler, a black woman whose 16-year-old son Phillip was shot to death by a white Teaneck police officer 30 years ago this April.Buy PhotoThelma Pannell-Dantzler, mother of Phillip Pannell who was shot and killed by a white police officer at the age of 16 in Teaneck in April 1990, speaks of her anger and sorrow in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, and so many others.

She looked out at the vast crowd and turned to the young organizers and said, "you guys are our future.'”The multiracial audience filled the school lawn and then poured onto Teaneck's streets, a passionate but peaceful crowd that wound through town, chanting "No Justice, No Peace” and "I Can't Breathe!”Drivers and onlookers stopped to cheer and blared horns in support.Protests: Youth 'want peace but feel rage' at George Floyd rally in HackensackCoronavirus: Will large George Floyd protests lead to a spike in NJ coronavirus cases?Phillip Pannell's death — he was shot in the back while trying to flee — touched off rioting in which police cars were damaged and stores looted, and then a yearlong series of protest marches through the township's business district, many led by the Rev. Al Sharpton. The officer, Gary Spath, was charged with manslaughter but later acquitted by an all-white jury."Our skin color is not a threat,” said Leah Cotes, an 18-year-old Teaneck High School graduate and one of the organizers of Friday's march. "We want to be able to run and breathe. We want to be seen and heard."Police officers on hand at the Bryant School greeted demonstrators with smiles and waves. At police headquarters on Teaneck Road, the scene was more tense, as a line of poker-faced cops in riot gear stood in front of the building while some protesters shouted "black lives matter!" into their faces from just feet away.Bergen County Sheriff Anthony Cureton said additional force had been called in from Leonia, Garfield, Fair Lawn and other nearby towns to help deal with what one township officer called the biggest protest he'd ever seen in Teaneck.Reader — covering our local communities takes time and resources.

She had brought her daughters, ages 6 and 3, to their first protest, she said proudly.As an administrator at a public school in New York for predominantly black and Latino students, she said she is keenly aware of racism. "I think about the privilege my own children have while others don't, and I understand that it's fundamentally unfair," she said. From police headquarters, protesters continued to Cedar Lane and ended with more slogans and several people taking a knee on River Road near Terhune Park.Mayor Mohammed Hameeduddin said Friday afternoon that he was proud of his town. "The Township came out. It was a very diverse group who marched. We sent the right message," he said, estimating that as many as 3,000 people joined the protest. "All the businesses and houses of worship were out giving out water and showing solidarity with the African American community."Vivian Mucheru, a longtime Teaneck resident, beamed as she walked home with her family.
