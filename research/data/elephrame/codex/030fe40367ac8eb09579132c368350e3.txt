By Chris Mays, Brattleboro Reformer BRATTLEBORO — Both sides of Main Street were filled with activists calling for the end of police brutality following the recent deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and Sean Reed. Anna Mullany of Brattleboro, who helped organize the event through Brattleboro Solidarity and hosts the show "Indigo Radio" on the community radio station WVEW, said participants were taking a stand against "state violence" against people of color as other communities across the country protest and rally. "We want to show we're with what's happening in big cities and condemn violence," Mullany said. Brattleboro Solidarity opposes the exploitation and oppression of all people. Tenants Union of Brattleboro also helped organize the event. A man who asked to go by D.H. for the article said the union "jumped" on the opportunity to participate as the world of tenant issues is steeped in racism and inequality. With Amanda Rose of Brattleboro, he held a banner that read "Stop Killing Black People." Sunday's event began at noon and participants were asked to wear masks and stand 6 feet apart to follow public health guidelines during the coronavirus pandemic. Chalk markings on sidewalks showed how far people should stand from one another. Photos went up on social media, stating #BrattleboroSolidarityBLM. BLM stands for "Black Lives Matter." Those who could not or did not want to stand on the street but wished to participate were asked to post photos on social media with signs or drive by the event in vehicles. Cars honked and motorcycles revved in support, getting large cheers from the crowd. The Brattleboro Police Department closed the street to vehicular traffic at 1:45 p.m. for a march. Police Chief Michael Fitzgerald counted more than 1,000 attendees as he followed behind the group.

Vanessa Santana of Brattleboro, who works with the Root Social Justice Center in town, said she came to stand in solidarity with Floyd, who died after a police officer pressed a knee on his neck until he stopped breathing in Minneapolis, and Taylor, a Kentucky woman who was killed by police during a warrant search on March 13. Arbery was fatally shot in February by a former police officer and his son on a Georgia residential street. Reed was killed by police after a foot chase with an officer in Indianapolis. Kestrel Feiner-Homer, who has lived in Minneapolis for about 11 years and grew up in Williamsville, held a painting of Floyd that said "Justice for George Floyd." She stood next to her mother Deb Feiner-Homer of Williamsville, who held a sign featuring names of people of color who have been killed by police.

She said her housemates are part of a neighborhood watch group right now and white supremacists are all over the city of Minneapolis. Giovane Glosson of Burlington said his girlfriend stays in Brattleboro and he is getting used to the community. "I think it's a good turnout," he said, adding that he felt it was a positive thing to see so much participation. As a person of color, he said seeing all the support makes him feel a lot more comfortable going out into the community. Ryan Washburn, an officer with the Brattleboro Police Department, said participants were trying to stay 6 feet apart during the event. He described the protest as peaceful. Article Continues After Advertisement "So far, it's been great," he said about a half hour into the event. Chants vibrated through the downtown to the beat of drums. "No justice, no peace!" activists yelled. "Black lives matter!" A list of names of everyone killed in what was described by Mullany as acts of police brutality from 2000 to 2020 was printed and chalk was used to write those names on sidewalks along Main Street. She said the list is predominately made up of people of color. In a letter addressed to "the people of Brattleboro" published in Monday's Reformer (see A5), Chief Fitzgerald described being "angered and saddened over the events surrounding the death of George Floyd at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer." "The actions of malicious officers along with an attitude of indifference of other officers in their blatant disregard towards human life has left me stunned," he wrote. "We have a professional duty to protect and serve everyone in the community with dignity and respect. Whenever someone is in our custody, we owe them a duty of care. This recent tragedy in Minneapolis is being played out far too often across our nation. Far too many encounters between law enforcement and people of color are deadly, especially those involving black men." On Friday, the Vermont State Police and Department of Public Safety Commissioner Michael Schirling condemned the actions of officers that led to Floyd's death. "What I have seen on video from the mishandled attempt to arrest George Floyd is beyond disturbing," Col. Matthew T. Birmingham, director of the Vermont State Police, said in statement. "This kind of conduct has no place in policing. It goes against everything we are taught from our earliest days in training academies. It goes against our mission to protect and serve the public. It goes against our oath and our badge. It goes against human decency." Reach staff writer Chris Mays at cmays@reformer.com and at @CMaysBR on Twitter.
