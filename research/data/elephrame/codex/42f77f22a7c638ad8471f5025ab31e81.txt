Ivan Garcia Ivan Garcia Author email Jul 14, 2016 Jul 14, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Black Lives Matter protestors marching down Broadway Avenue in Seaside in 2016. Nic Coury Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save After a week of massive demonstrations across the nation protesting the police killings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, two black men whose deaths were captured in viral videos, locals held a rally in Seaside supporting the Black Lives Matter movement.More than 100 people gathered in the plaza next to the Buffalo Wild Wings, on the busy corner of Broadway and Fremont Boulevard on Wednesday afternoon.Miriam Smith, a Seaside resident who organized the event, was first to speak on the microphone."Not long ago, Seaside was the most important black city between Los Angeles and San Francisco,” Smith said. "And today, we continue to fight for civil rights.”Smith then passed the microphone to a preacher, and everyone in the crowd collectively bowed their heads for a moment, setting the calm tone that defined the demonstration.Speakers from organizations like the Monterey County branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Watsonville Brown Berets, and Whites for Racial Equity touched on issues including racial disparities and gun violence.When it came to proposed solutions, however, ideas varied widely ranging from reforms in police training to abolishing police as an institution."People feel like they have to demonstrate to live safely,” Stephanie Spoto of Direct Action Monterey Network said, referring to protests in Seaside and nationwide. "It's not about police training, it's curbing the consolidation of their power.” An hour into the rally, the group marched down the sidewalk on Broadway, raising signs with messages like "Silence is Betrayal” and "Black Love, Brown Pride” while chanting, "No justice, no peace, no racist police.”Police cruisers blocked off certain areas, like the intersection of Clementina Avenue and Heitzinger Plaza, and protesters maneuvered around, walking down Fremont before returning back to the plaza where they'd started."Throughout history, blacks have be prone to police violence,” said Sharon Green, who runs Victor Valley Family Resource Center in San Bernardino County. "Some think since we elected Obama he would fix race issues, but our president can't do it all alone.”Those affected by police violence on a local level also chimed in. Frank Alvarado Sr., whose son Frank Alvarado Jr. was shot and killed by Salinas police in 2014, said supporting the event was his way of honoring his activist son."Don't wait till it happens to you to speak up,” Alvarado told the crowd.As the event started winding down and some protesters began leaving around 6pm, Smith passed the mic to Monterey County Supervisor Jane Parker.Parked said officers need to be trained to respect communities they serve, but people can't forget to show respect back. "Let's make Monterey County safe for all,” she said to applause.Six Seaside police officers arrived to the plaza and handed out breath mints in tin containers to protestors and their children. "Despite my uniform, when I go home at night I'm a normal person,” said Cmdr. Nick Borges. "I'm a parent, I'm a brother, I'm a son, and I respect life.” Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save Ivan Garcia Author email Follow Ivan Garcia Recommended for you × Post a comment as Emoticons [smile] [beam] [wink] [sad] [cool] [innocent] [rolleyes] [whistling] [lol] [huh] [tongue] [love] [sleeping] [yawn] [unsure] [angry] [blink] [crying] [ohmy] [scared] [sleep] [sneaky] [tongue_smile] [thumbdown] [thumbup] [censored] [happybirthday] [ban] [spam] [offtopic] [batman] [ninja] [pirate] [alien] Comment Text Cancel Post comment × Report Cancel Report Abuse × Watch this discussion.
