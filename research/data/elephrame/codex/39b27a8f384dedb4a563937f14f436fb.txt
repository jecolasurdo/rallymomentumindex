Mime Troupe's Schooled Arts Events Education Classes & Seminars Recommended Stand-Up Paddleboarding Lessons When the ancient Polynesians invented surfing, they often used a paddle to help them navigate. Fast-forward a few millennia, and Stand-Up Paddleboarding, or SUP, finds itself trendy again. Part of its increasing popularity is that standing upright allows surfers to spot waves more easily and thus catch more of them, multiplying the fun factor. Paddling back to the wave becomes less of a strain as well. The ability to cruise along on flat inland water, surveying the sights, is another advantage. Finally, it's a good core workout. If you're sold on the idea, schedule an intro SUP lesson, free with board and paddle rental, and you may find yourself riding the waves like a Polynesian king.

Saturday mornings at the Randall Museum can bring that memory back, or create a new one for the youngsters. Ceramics make great gifts — especially on Mothers' and Fathers' Day. Hop on board for the Randall's once-weekly class, and for $6 and two weeks to have your work fired and glazed, you'll have all the materials you need.

Not Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf. Even if she wanted to catch some extra shuteye, the newly minted mayor was abruptly woken up early this morning by protesters outside her door dancing and shouting and yelling as part of their "Wake Up the Mayor" demonstration. Some 50 protesters arrived at her Upper Dimond house at 5 a.m., shouting things such as "Wake up, Libby" and "No sleeping on the job." And yes, bullhorns were involved. The Chron reports that at about 6:30 a.m., protesters played some audio of famous King speeches while they stood silently with their fists in the air. The group reportedly said they were targeting the mayor because she spent her first day on the job meeting with Oakland cops. Cheers and dancing as it appears police have left #WakeUpTheMayor #ReclaimMLK #BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/x9fm59FSR2— Julia Carrie Wong (@juliacarriew) January 19, 2015 The morning protest marks the final day of the 96 hours of demonstrations across Oakland as part of the #BlackLivesMatter movement. Last night, some 150 people marched through downtown Oakland, disrupting BART service temporarily.

The packed Brava Theater hosted an initially seated crowd that ended the night jumping and dancing against the front of the stage. The trio performed a set focused on their recently released Sci-Fi Horror concept album, 'Splendor & Misery', then delved into their dancier and more aggressive back catalogue, and recent single 'Wriggle'. Opening performances included local experimental electronic duo 'Tujurikkuja' and computer music artist 'Madalyn Merkey.'"
