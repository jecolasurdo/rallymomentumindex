Several protesters chanted, "No justice, no peace.” Tubbs said officers insisted on providing a presence for those who were leaving the meeting.Earlier, during the meeting's public comment period, five of the protesters addressed the council: semi-regular attendee Aaron Paradiso; the activist mother of a 16-year-old boy killed by police in 2010; the aunt and mother of a 21-year-old man killed by an off-duty Sheriff's Deputy last year; and the brother of a 30-year-old man killed by a police officer last year."We're hoping that now that we have a new mayor we can move forward and we can come up with some solutions to this police brutality and the murder of innocent people of color, because it is happening,” Paradiso told the council. "People are getting killed.”Denise Bradley, the mother of the late Keenan Bradley, 21, added, "My son is dead. My son is gone. He can never walk on these streets, never give me grandkids, never give me nothing. You stole my son from me. ... It ain't right.”When Keenan Bradley was killed four months ago, the off-duty deputy who shot him said he had been confronted by two armed, masked men at a northwest Stockton apartment complex.Tim Daly, a spokesman for the San Joaquin County District Attorney's Office, said Wednesday a multiagency investigation into the shooting is continuing.Sheriff's deputies like the one who shot Bradley are employees of the county, not the city. The council has no authority over the Sheriff's Office. Vice Mayor Elbert Holman, however, promised to call Denise Bradley to discuss what happened..embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; }Three others killed in incidents involving Stockton police also were cited Tuesday: James Rivera, 16; Colby Friday, 30; and Abelino Cordova-Cuevas, 28. Daly said Wednesday no police wrongdoing was revealed in the multiagency investigation into Rivera's death in 2010. The other three deaths remain under investigation, Daly said.Holman, who spent 34 years in law enforcement, told the audience at one point Tuesday, "I was arrested once by the Stockton Police Department for something I didn't do before being a cop. I've been down that road and know exactly what you're talking about. You have to have the police. All the police aren't bad. Just like every business, every profession, you do have some bad eggs that are in there.”Paradiso pressed for the release of police videos of the killings that were cited Tuesday night.The Stockton Police Department amended its policy for releasing officer-worn body camera footage in December. Police Chief Eric Jones said at the time the new policy allows him to release footage from critical incidents within days rather than months or years.Jones added that the new policy enables him to release footage of officer-involved shootings and other use-of-force incidents at his discretion when circumstances present a "compelling and pressing public interest.” No videos have been publicly released since the policy change; neither have their been any officer-involved shootings in that time.Officers have been required since body cameras were introduced in Stockton in 2015 to turn them on when they come in contact with the public. But Officer David Wells did not turn his camera on when he shot Friday to death last summer."We want the officers to have to put them on any time they come in contact with anybody in the community, and especially we want them to put them on when they are dealing with demonstrations, because there are going to be a lot more demonstrations,” Paradiso said.Also voiced during Tuesday's meeting by one protester was the suggestion that current unrest could lead to a repeat in Stockton of last July's killings of five law-enforcement officers in Dallas by a heavily armed sniper.John Henry, who identified himself as Friday's brother, told the City Council, "I'm telling you, your cops is (bleeping) up. Do you want to fix this or what? ... You need to face this before (expletive) starts getting crazy.”Henry was the last meeting attendee to request the chance to speak Tuesday night, and Tubbs did not cut him off despite the profanity. After Henry's remarks, Tubbs called a five-minute recess. During an interview Wednesday, Tubbs condemned any talk of anti-police violence."Folks are trying to create in Stockton some of the turmoil and divisiveness we're seeing in the nation,” Tubbs said. "That's not going to happen here. It's absolutely unacceptable to threaten police officers. It gets us no closer to solutions and no closer to justice.”During the recess, according to Tubbs, some of the protesters said they had come from Oakland for the meeting. The mayor expressed disappointment Wednesday at the attendance of protesters from outside the area."It's a Stockton City Council meeting taking Stockton resources, and if people aren't Stockton constituents it's not a good use of Stockton taxpayers' money,” Tubbs said.There was more from the community, though.Dionne Smith-Downs, who has become an activist since Rivera's death, asked on behalf of Friday's mother about the whereabouts of an inscribed stone she placed at an outdoor memorial for her son after his death.Smith-Downs said there is some speculation it was removed by a city worker, and the mother wants the stone back. City spokesman Connie Cochran said Wednesday she has been investigating and has found no evidence the stone was taken by a city employee."Absolutely not,” Cochran said. "It is our policy and practice that we do not disturb memorials.”Smith-Downs also complained that the police have yet to arrest a suspect in the killing of her 42-year-old brother, Bobby Smith, who died from a gunshot wound in November. Officer Joe Silva, a spokesman for the Police Department, said the search for Bobby Smith's killer is an "active investigation.”Tubbs said the issues of police violence and its aftereffects are generational matters and cannot be solved overnight."We're dealing with 50 years of trauma and anger,” Tubbs said Tuesday. "We can do more, but let's not behave as if our Police Department isn't trying to reform itself and isn't making the reforms to move our city forward.”Tubbs attended a community meeting last week in the tough Kentfield neighborhood with Holman and Councilwoman Susan Lenz. The mayor also cited numerous community conversations that have been initiated in the past year by Chief Jones, and he asked for patience that will allow the newly seated council to continue reforms."I would just ask for the chance to show ourselves worthy and show ourselves strong,” Tubbs said. "If nothing changes, if nothing works, then fine, be disruptive, disrupt the meeting.”— Contact reporter Roger Phillips at (209) 546-8299 or rphillips@recordnet.com.
