Their destination was what's known as the Gateway Corridor on Vine Street in Over-the-Rhine."We want everybody to know it's not business as usual. It's not alright to have a beer and not think about the murder that took place in Cincinnati," said Brian Taylor, a leader of the local Black Lives Matter organization.Carlnetta Flagg-Miles leads a chant during "Rally and Street Action: Demand a Retrial" Justice for Sam DuBose sponsored by Black Lives Matter: Cincinnati at Findlay Playground, in Over-the-Rhine Saturday July 8, 2017.

(Photo: The Enquirer/Cara Owsley)He stood in the middle of Vine Street, just south of the intersection of 13th Street, near the open windows of The Lackman bar and spoke through a bullhorn."We will be back here again and will be taking to the streets," Taylor said.Demonstrators, estimated between 150 and 200, lined both sidewalks just south of 13th along Vine, Prompted by leaders using bullhorns, they chanted loudly, "Black lives matter," "Not paid activists," and "No more paid vacation, no more paid leave."The police bike squad had three times forced marchers off the streets and onto sidewalks. In previous marches over the past year, especially, police kept a distance from marchers and allowed them to walk on streets.The first altercation Saturday came at the corner of East Clifton and Main in Over-the-Rhine, near the main entrance of Rothenberg Preparatory Academy. A few marked police SUVs rolled up in support. Bike officers had formed a barrier with their bicycles and blocked the street and sidewalk. After a few tense minutes, officers allowed marchers to continue south on Main on the sidewalk.

People have the right to protest peacefully."Officers finally allowed marchers to funnel through on the sidewalk near a building wall. It was there that a marcher, Theresa Felton, of Forest Park, was pinned against the wall by a bike officer."There was a bunch of people in a group, and one of the officers was letting us get by," said Felton, an African-American and a Black Lives Matter supporter. "An officer in the middle said, 'Stop.' I was trying to get through, and another officer jammed me up against the wall with his bike."One of the march marshals, Siri Imani, pulled her through."I was in shock, and then I got angry," Felton said. "Siri grabbed me. She told me to stay calm and said she would be with me."As of midnight, a police spokeswoman was still attempting to get answers to The Enquirer's questions on enforcement tactics used Saturday.An answer came at 1:56 a.m. Sunday in a text message from spokeswoman Tiffaney Hardy."The best way to explain it, as it was explained to me, (is) that there was no approved permit like anyone else would need to march on the public streets," Hardy wrote in the text. "Attempts were made to make BLM adhere to the law like anyone else would be required."This could include arrests for future non-compliance."Black Lives Matter did not have a street permit for its large march July 10 of last year that started at police headquarters in the West End, police said at the time.On Saturday night, once allowed to continue, marchers turned south on Main and west on 13th Street. Before wheeling south on Vine Street, the large group split into two to fill sidewalls on both sides of Vine.With renewed energy, they chanted, "Black lives matter" and "Sam DuBose means we've got to fight back."Members of the Cincinnati Police Department block protesters from heading toward Main Street during the "Rally and Street Action: Demand a Retrial" Justice for Sam DuBose Saturday, July 8, 2017.

(Photo: The Enquirer/Cara Owsley)Bar and restaurant patrons, almost all of them white, watched quietly. Some people took cell phone video and still photographs of the protest.Members of the police bike squad formed a wall across Vine at 12th. Other bike officers kept protesters on sidewalks on either side of Vine between12th and 13th streets.Around 7:30 p.m., a supervisor rode up on his bicycle and ordered officers to fall back from protesters. The squad regrouped a block north at the corner of 14th and Vine.Marchers, who refer to themselves as members of the Countdown to Conviction Coalition, then flooded Vine Street for a short time. Then they again moved to sidewalks on both sides of Vine and resumed loud chants.Many protesters were white. April Linz brought her two children, sons 4 and 2."We are here because black lives matter," Linz said as she pushed a stroller north on Vine after the rally. "I brought my children because it starts with them. Ray Tensing should be in jail."Tensing said he feared for his life during the July 2015 traffic stop because DuBose was driving off and dragging him with his car. Neither of the two Tensing juries could reach a unanimous decision on either murder or voluntary manslaughter charges.Randy Bruins, also white, 62 and from Clifton, said he followed both trials closely. He and a friend brought a large sign that quoted from the biblical book of Isaiah. It read, "The Lord looked for justice but saw bloodshed; for righteousness, but heard cries of distress."Said Bruins, "This is a stain on our community and an open wound. I feel like I need to stand with the African-American community and say that I see what's happening."The other side of Bruins' sign read, "Try, Try Again."Hamilton County Prosecutor Joe Deters said he would announce the week of July 10 whether he would retry Tensing.Demonstrators raise their fists during a moment of silence for Sam DuBose on Vine Street in Over-the-Rhine during "Rally and Street Action: Demand a Retrial" Justice for Sam DuBose sponsored by Black Lives Matter: Cincinnati Saturday, July 8, 2017.

Two unmarked black police SUVs waited on Vine Street, about a block north from where a squad of Cincinnati police bicycle officers waited.CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2017/07/09/blm-march-dubose/462428001/Find JobsShare your feedback to help improve our site experience!
