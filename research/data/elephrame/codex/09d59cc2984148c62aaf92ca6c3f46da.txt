I ask that you stop by and show them that you are in SUPPORT of their REVOLUTION. Bring food if you can, these children are fighting for our future kids as well as themselves #NoCopAcademy121 N LASALLE ST — Chance The Rapper (@chancetherapper) March 28, 2018 Chicago Tribune reporter Bill Ruthhart tweeted Wednesday that about three dozen young protestors were disrupting a Chicago City Council meeting, and attempted to get to the mayor's fifth floor office, but were blocked by police. According to Chicago's WGN-TV, the students from the South and West Sides of Chicago set up tombstones with names of people killed in police shootings, as well the schools, mental health clinics, and other services the city has closed down. Protestors reportedly argue that instead of building the $95 million police academy in Chicago's West Garfield park neighborhood, the city should instead invest the funds in under served communities.
