'What if it was your mother?': Daughter demands action, answers in Walmart incident - al.com Skip to ArticleBirmingham Real-Time News'What if it was your mother?': Daughter demands action, answers in Walmart incidentUpdated Jan 13, 2019; Posted Dec 03, 2016 Monica Dawkins talks about mother who was "body slammed" by policeBy Jonece Starr Dunigan | jdunigan@al.com On the road shoulder of Lakeshore Parkway, Monica Dawkins demanded an apology from the Homewood mayor Friday night.Her mother, Brenda Rivers, was detained by police at the Homewood Wal-Mart Thursday night during an investigation about a stolen wallet. According to police, Rivers was placed in handcuffs because she didn't allow officers to search her purse and tried to leave the scene. According to Rivers' husband, Rivers' rights were violated because the officers didn't have a search warrant.Dawkins learned about the incident by watching cellphone videos from witnesses that went viral overnight on Facebook. The nearly 30-minute footage shows Rivers in handcuffs on the floor asking police to let her go because she didn't steal the wallet. Her husband can be seen in the video defending his wife. Eventually the victim of the theft cleared Rivers of the theft, but she remained in handcuffs for 15 minutes before she was released without charges.Dawkins said her mother and the family is still in shock and hurt about the situation. She said her mother was "violated" and had a right to deny the officer's request to check her purse. Rivers directed questions from Al.com to her attorney on Friday morning.When asked about the family's next steps, Dawkins wasn't sure."I don't even know because I've never been here before," Dawkins said. "All I know is that I can stand with the community to do what's right for my mother. My dear mother."Dawkins is not pleased with how the incident is being handled. She said she hasn't heard from the officers since the incident. The officers involved are still on duty, but Dawkins wants disciplinary action. Internal Affairs is investigating whether the officers acted within departmental policy, but she wants a higher authority, like the FBI, to consider the case.Cara McClure, of Black Lives Matter Birmingham Chapter, joined in her protest Dawkins to stand in solidarity with the Rivers family. She attended the press conference held outside police headquarters Friday afternoon and listened as Homewood police Lt. Eric Hampton gave details about the incident and apologized to the family and witnesses involved.But McClure said the apology was unacceptable and demanded a statement from Homewood Mayor Scott McBrayer. She said BLM members spoke with Chief of Staff J.J. Bischoff and the police chief before the press conference. But she hasn't heard a statement from the mayor's office as of Friday night. Dawkins said she was not informed about the press conference at all.Black Lives matter Bham chapter having a protest on Lakeshore Parkway in front of Walmart. pic.twitter.com/wuD0s8gReF— Jonece Starr Dunigan (@StarrDunigan) December 3, 2016 For brief moment, McClure and Dawkins stood in front of incoming traffic at an intersection near the Interstate 65 South exit ramp. Some drivers beeped and shouted in supported. Some shouted over their chants in displeasure. But no one was hurt during the gathering.The women were escorted back to the side of the road after a brief discussion with a Homewood officer. The ladies told the officer they were not going to leave the side of the road until they spoke to McBrayer. When the officer came back to tell Dawkins the mayor wasn't coming, she proceeded to talk about her mother, who is "as sweet as pie" and rarely gets in trouble."What if it was your mother?" Dawkins asked the officer. "How would you feel if it was your mother, 30 years older than you right now, and somebody body slammed her to the floor? How would you feel? Would you not be angry? Would you not be hurt? Would you not want answers?"The officer said he understood Dawkins' feelings, but stressed to her the internal investigation will take time. So Dawkins agreed to give the mayor until 6 p.m. Saturday to release a statement or she will be back protesting on the streets again with her Black Lives Matter banner and her fist in the air."You're asking for a little bit of time? The family will give you a little bit time, but we're not going to wait forever," Dawkins said. "It's not going to get lost. It's not going to be forgotten. It's not going to be swept under a rug."Kayatta Evans came to the protest to make sure Rivers wasn't forgotten. She wanted to stand beside Dawkins because she was the first woman the Homewood officers approached that Thursday night about the stolen wallet. Evans said the officer told her she matched the description of the theft suspect: an older black woman wearing black pants and a black jacket. She said she looked down at her blue pants and tan shoes she was wearing at the time.At first, she didn't allow the officer to look in her purse because she felt she didn't do anything wrong. But she eventually allowed the officer to search her belongings."I said, 'Sir, this is so degrading. This is so embarrassing,'" Evans said. "He said, 'Well, things like this happen.' And he went away."Evans was shocked when she saw the chaos that happened afterwards. As a former lost prevention investigator with 22 years of experience, she believes police should have watched the surveillance footage from Wal-Mart first to catch the theft suspect before they accused of a crime."It was just wrong the way they handled her. The way they threw her to the floor. They never offered her seat," said. "You are a police officer. Your job is to protect and to serve not to harass. Not to throw us down on the ground. Not to degrade us. That is not your job. And you wonder why people are afraid of the police."Evans said she wanted to show the family her support Friday night. As a woman who has chronic back and neck problems, she also placed herself in Rivers' shoes."What if I had said no and not let him go into my purse," Evans said. "Would that be me on the floor? It was nothing but the grace of God that I said yes. The Lord allowed that fear to come over me because it could have been me."Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
