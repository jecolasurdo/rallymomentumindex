(Staten Island Advance/Joseph Ostapiuk)By Joseph Ostapiuk | jostapiuk@siadvance.com STATEN ISLAND, N.Y. -- Seven people involved in a protest against the Justice Department's decision to not indict the police officer involved in the police-custody death of Eric Garner were arrested on Monday for blocking traffic on the FDR Drive.The arrests took place around 11 a.m., according to police, near E. 106th Street in Manhattan.The Daily News reported that the seven were expected to be issued desk appearance tickets after being charged with disorderly conduct."Eric Garner had a right to live,” read a sign, carried by some of the protesters, the Daily News reported.The arrests come less than a week after at least 1,000 protesters made their way from Foley Square in Lower Manhattan to One Police Plaza to mark the five-year anniversary of the death of Garner.Last week, activists said they plan to shut the city down for the next 11 days with a series of protests and blockades at places that receive city funding.The protests are aimed at calling on Police Commissioner James O'Neill and Mayor Bill de Blasio to fire Staten Island Officer Daniel Pantaleo in connection to Garner's police-custody death, and the other officers who were at the scene on Bay Street the day Garner died, July 17, 2014.The mayor has refused to say whether he personally thinks Pantaleo should be fired, only saying he wants the process of the officer's NYPD disciplinary proceeding to run its course.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
