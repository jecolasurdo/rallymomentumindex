(protest) in silence, go to the courts," she said.She was awoken in the early hours by a phone call from the alarm company. Not knowing what to expect, she drove from her home in Oak Creek to her family's Boost Mobile store on N. Martin Luther King Jr. Drive in Milwaukee's Harambee neighborhood. The windows were smashed, the merchandise all gone.Katherine Mahmoud owns the Boost Mobile store on North King Drive in Milwaukee, which was looted in the early morning of May 30. (Photo: Bill Glauber / Milwaukee Journal Sentinel)It's infuriating, she said, especially as her store has "nothing to do" with what protesters were rallying against."I look just like them," she said. Why did they do it?"Don't get me wrong, I'm pissed about George Floyd. ... It could have been my brother, it could have been my son."What people need to do is "go above," she said — "change some laws so this won't happen" and ensure law-enforcement officers will be held accountable for their actions.—Bill Glauber1:26 a.m.: Boost Mobile looted, police releasing tear gas on remaining crowdsA larger fire was burning in another part of Walgreens, according to a Facebook livestream.

"The outright abuse inflicted upon George Floyd not only failed to meet the legal and professional standards that require officers to exercise force reasonably, it desecrated the most basic notions of human decency." The WPPA, the largest police group in the state, said the officers' conduct undoes the work of other officers around the country trying to strengthen community relationships."We see no justification for the officers' actions in this case, and they represent an affront to the core values and principles upon which the law enforcement profession is founded," according to the statement. 1:41 p.m.: Officer who put knee on Floyd's neck charged with third-degree murderAs protesters rallied in Milwaukee, authorities in Minneapolis announced criminal charges against the Minneapolis police officer who killed George Floyd.The Star Tribune reports Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter Friday afternoon.1:34 p.m. 'There is no reason I should be mistreated for being born'A young woman stepped up to the microphone to speak."I am a person, I am a human being, I was born into this world," she said.

Tony Evers and Attorney General Josh Kaul released separate statements condemning the death of George Floyd"Earlier this week, another Black life was extinguished before our eyes. His name was George Floyd. He was 46. His life matters and his family deserves justice. There was no empathy or humanity in his death," Evers said."This was not an anomaly," he continued. "We hear the echo of the words of Eric Garner. We relive the pain of the death of Black Wisconsinites like Dontre Hamilton, Ernest Lacy, and Sylville Smith. Frustration and anger about systemic injustices are always justified."Evers said those who protest should be able to do so peacefully and without fear of being unsafe or arrested. He encouraged demonstrators to wear their masks and try to maintain social distancing.Kaul, the state's top law enforcement officer, called Floyd's death "torture and murder.""What America witnessed happening to George Floyd in Minneapolis was not, in any true sense of the phrase, law enforcement. It was torture and murder, under color of law,” Kaul said. "Justice demands that those involved in this depraved crime be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.”1:18 p.m.: Honoring all who have died at the hands of policeFred Royal, president of the NAACP Milwaukee Branch, called on those gathered to keep working for justice after the rally."This is to honor those who died at the hands of police brutality," Royal said, adding: "The question is what are you going to do when the cameras are gone and the excitement dies down?”"This is to honor those who died at the hands of police brutality ... the question is what are you going to do when the cameras are gone and the excitement dies down?” - Fred Royal president of Milwaukee's NAACP pic.twitter.com/Cjo2C9sDaw— Talis Shelbourne (@talisseer) May 29, 20201:12 p.m.: Rally starts with a moment of silenceThe rally got underway with a moment of silence for George Floyd and organizers offering masks to anyone who didn't have one.Moment of silence for Floyd as people hold up their hands in the shape of an L for love pic.twitter.com/uWBU0KkROX— Talis Shelbourne (@talisseer) May 29, 2020FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInA rally in protest of the death of George Floyd FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
