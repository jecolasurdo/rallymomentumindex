Blood on her hands!": Black Lives Matter protester interrupts Chelsea Clinton event in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania's Black Lives Matters activists are going after the Clintons tough view in app -- Shares Sophia Tesfaye April 13, 2016 10:13PM (UTC) Black Lives Matters activists in Pennsylvania are giving the Clinton campaign no passes, popping up at Clinton campaign stops across the state to vocally protest Bill Clinton's problematic legacy in the African-American community, even targeting daughter and surrogate to her mother, Chelsea Clinton. Speaking at Clinton's campaign office in East Liberty, Wednesday, Chelsea Clinton was interrupted by Pittsburgh based Black Lives Matter activist Julia Johnson who shouted through the crowd, "She's killing us! She's killing us,” reported the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.Advertisement: Needless to say, the entire room of about 100 Clinton supporters appeared so shocked that Johnson was able to shout out "Blood on her hands!” before eventually being drowned out by the crowd who chanted, "Hillary!" "Hillary!": According to the Post-Gazette, Chelsea appeared unfazed by Johnson's protest. The 23-year-old activist was reportedly accusing Clinton of working too closely with Republicans, according to the Post-Gazette. Of course, Bill Clinton was also interrupted by Black Lives Matters protesters in Pennsylvania who held signs that read "Hillary is a murderer!" and "Black youth are not super predators,” last week. The former president took a remarkably different tone with the protesters than his daughter did, scolding protesters for disrupting his speech in Philadelphia and lecturing the activists about black support for his welfare reform and tough on crime efforts in the 1990s. Read what the activists who confronted the former president last week told Salon in an exclusive interview here.Advertisement: For her part, Hillary Clinton is still campaigning in New York, set to vote next Tuesday. Clinton spoke to Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network's annual convention Wednesday afternoon. "If we're gonna ask African Americans to vote for us we cannot take you or your vote for granted,” Clinton told the African-American activists, alluding to her rival, Bernie Sanders', underperformance with African-American voters. "We can't just show up at election time and say the right thing and think that is enough. We can't start building relationships a few weeks before a vote.” Sophia Tesfaye Sophia Tesfaye is Salon's Deputy Politics Editor and resides in Washington, D.C.
