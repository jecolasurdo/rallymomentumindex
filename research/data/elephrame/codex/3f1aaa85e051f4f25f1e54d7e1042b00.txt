The interaction escalated into shouting at times until McCoy addressed one of the demands: to provide a house, a safe space, for the Association of African American Students and students of color.The university sent a letter directly to the association in response to their eight demands, DePauw spokesman Ken Owen said, but the organization requested that the letter not be shared publicly.She said her ex sexually assaulted her:Nearly a year later, she's charged with his murder.Jenna Fischer's generosity:Actor donates DePauw University pay after student protests shake up the schoolEfforts by IndyStar to reach leaders of the association were unsuccessful Wednesday. Multiple association members approached on campus Wednesday declined to be interviewed, saying they were asked by the association's leadership not to comment.The night before, Fischer, who came to Indiana to talk about her career, found herself ensnarled in the initial protest as about 100 students with signs sat in both aisles of Kresge Auditorium in Greencastle. About 1,450 people were in attendance.About 15 minutes into Fischer's free lecture, someone in the crowd stood up and blew a whistle, said Shannon Samson, an Indianapolis resident who attended the event and contacted IndyStar with a video of the protest. "It was very tense," Samson said.Some protesters began to yell. A number of voices are heard expressing concern about safety and calling on university leaders to take action after at least four recent instances of racist, homophobic, anti-Muslim or anti-Semitic messages were reported on campus.What we know now:Updates about DePauw University protests over racist incidentsSenate Race 2018:Luke Messer didn't disclose DUIs when he replaced lawmaker killed by drunk driverFischer initially appeared startled by the protests but later Tuesday evening expressed sympathy with the protesters. On Wednesday she tweeted that she was "shocked and upset" to hear what was happening on the DePauw campus."In light of last night's events, using the full amount I was paid by the university, I will be making equal donations to the NAACP, the Anti-Defamation League and the Trevor Project in the name of the students at DePauw University," she said in her tweet."My hope is for all people to be respected, accepted and loved for their individuality and uniqueness. And, above all, to be safe."In a letter Monday to the DePauw community, McCoy said the university was taking several steps in response to the racist messages. The university also has contacted the Greencastle Police Department, the mayor of Greencastle and the Indiana State Police for assistance in investigating each incident, he said."I want to state categorically that slurs, threats or intimidation are never welcome on this campus," he said in the letter. "We will be taking a host of actions and you will hear additional comments from me in the coming days. Make no mistake, we will take every action available to us to address these incidents."The first incident occurred April 11, when a racist threat was found in a men's bathroom stall at The Inn at DePauw and Event Center, Owen said. Photos of the message, written in black marker, were circulated late that night through social media. Campus police were alerted the next day, Owen said, and began an investigation. McCoy's letter and students referenced three other incidents that were reported in the past week. A racial slur was found spelled in rocks in the DePauw Nature Park, a female student was believed to be wearing blackface and an offensive sign at The Fluttering Duck bar and a homophobic and anti-Semitic message was written in another campus bathroom. Which bathroom was unclear. Owen said that after the initial slur was found at The Inn university officials scoured bathrooms for others.On campus Wednesday afternoon, sophomore Cathelin Huang said she didn't feel entirely safe after the past week. She said she struggled with how to articulate her feelings."Somehow, I don't really feel at home here," the student from California said. "It's a weird feeling."Huang said she was surprised by the reaction of some students to the protest at Fischer's lecture."People say that they felt uncomfortable for the 30 minutes during the protest, but for people of color, we've been going through that for our whole lives," she said.Sophomores Emma Wittkowski and Natalie Brunini and freshman Kathleen Banek said they had been talking non-stop about the protest and the events that led up to it."It has made us recognize that we haven't been talking about it enough," Wittkowski said. "This isn't an isolated event. Our school hasn't chosen to talk about it."Talking about it, Brunini said, has caused her to think about how minorities' everyday experiences differ from hers."This was something that I wasn't thinking about last week, but now it's something that I'm going to be thinking about for the next however long," she said. "I think there there are a lot of people like me on this campus who didn't know it was a problem and now we're aware that it is."In front of the Green Center for the Performing Arts, where Fischer's lecture was held, a group of students walked a painted bed sheet over to a tree. The sheet said, "POC, LGBTQ+, marginalized students we stand with you." A group of about 50 students from fraternities and sororities gathered to sign the sheet."I'm standing up for the people at my school who don't feel safe," junior Lucas Schilling said. "And we want to hang it up for the entire school to see. It's a very public area."Parent Neiko Gilbert said that when her freshman daughter called her to tell her about the slurs found on campus, she immediately came to pick her up."When she calls, I come," the Indianapolis resident said. "It's already hard enough to release your children into society."Gilbert plans to take her daughter home for the night to clear her mind, she said. She said she hopes her presence lets the university know that these racial issues are bigger than the students on campus."I need them to know that these children do have parents that care," she said.At Wasser Brewing Co. nearby, Greencastle resident and retired DePauw professor Barbara Bean said the incidents are unnerving."It's just terribly upsetting," she said. "One incident would've been bad enough, but it keeps going on. Why? Why would someone do that?"Concerns over racism and racist messages on campus is not unique to DePauw.Earlier this year, the Indiana University Bloomington Residence Hall Association released a statement condemning a racially charged Snapchat message that used a Black History Month filter over a series of items that played to racial stereotypes, the Indiana Daily Student reported. In September, Indiana State University required students living in residence halls and resident advisers to complete racial bias training after a student posted a picture of a message saying "Black lives don't matter" on a whiteboard outside her room. In February of last year, posters promoting white-nationalist group Identity Europa were found on the doors of several IU minority staff and faculty members, Fox59 reported. Lecia Brooks, outreach director for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said similar incidents are increasing on college campuses across the country. In 2017, she said, the center counted more than 300 flier incidents at 200 campuses, and 2018 looks to be maintaining that pace. The center monitors hate groups and other extremists throughout the U.S."We do know that there's been a general emboldenment on the part of people who hold biased and bigoted thoughts,” she said. "There's been kind of this feeling that it's OK to share. ... They don't feel like the consequences are going to be as harsh as they may have been in the past.”College campuses often serve as the backdrop for these conversations, she said, especially when campuses are characterized or seen as liberal bastions of free speech. "That really kind of is the problem; that's part of the push-back,” she said. "People who maybe don't support multiculturalism or feel like their thoughts, ideas, beliefs are not represented would push back and say that ... people with conservative thoughts and opinions don't get to say anything.”There is a difference, she said, between conservative thoughts and hate speech. Situations like DePauw's further illustrate the need for larger, more inclusive conversations about racial diversity on college campuses. "It's important that students be guided in a way that they can build relationships with one another,” she said. "It's not simply a matter of the administration laying out certain edicts; we have to work with people and individuals or nothing changes.”Owen said that before Fischer's lecture began Tuesday, the actress was made aware of the recent events on DePauw's campus. Owen was moderating on stage when the protest began."There was a sense there might be some kind of protest because the tensions have been building about the messages that have been appearing on campus," Owen said. "I gave her brief details on the incidents, and this is why they're upset and why they're hurt, and it might show itself tonight."Backstage before the event, Fischer expressed that it was important the students' voices were heard, Owen said. When the protest began, she "was extremely supportive of letting the students have their time.""She sat there, she listened, she got very emotional," Owen said. "It affected her. I think her reaction was absolutely spot on, and I think respectful."The protest lasted about 15 minutes as students marched out in unison, Owen said. Fischer stayed and finished the conversation on stage. Owen didn't ask many of the questions he originally planned."I think we were both shell-shocked," Owen said. "When we resumed the event, the tone obviously was much different. It didn't seem right to talk about 'The Office.'"About 20 percent of DePauw's 2,100 students are minorities and 10 percent are international students. About 19 percent of the faculty members are minorities. Fischer stayed after and signed books, he said. Fischer, best known for her role as Pam Beesly on the mockumentary sitcom "The Office," came to DePauw for a lecture, to answer questions and sign copies of her book, "The Actor's Life: A Survival Guide."IndyStar reporter Holly V.
