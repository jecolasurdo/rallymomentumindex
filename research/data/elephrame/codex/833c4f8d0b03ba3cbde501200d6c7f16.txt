The protest was, however, more of a roll than a walk. It was organized by Critical Mass, a monthly mass bicycle caravan ride that usually sees crowds of a few hundred riders in goofy costumes and lit-up bikes on city streets, just for fun. While the presence of bikes remained for Friday's event, the meaning is different: It was intended to pay tribute to Floyd and make a public, peaceful appeal for police reform. Patricia Chang/Special to the SFGATEIt was eerie on Market Street on Friday evening, the city's main thoroughfare, with storefronts boarded up while wind howled through high-rises downtown. Patricia Chang/Special to the SFGATEHordes of protesters poured into Embarcadero Plaza from every direction, with masks on, Black Lives Matter signs taped to their jackets, and bicycles, skateboards and scooters fashioned into billboards for a cause to call for equality. Patricia Chang/Special to the SFGATEA high school mountain biking team was in attendance, and many families, too. Patricia Chang/Special to the SFGATEOne little girl ate her hamburger on the back of a bike while her mom pedaled, and another toted his French bulldog behind him. Patricia Chang/Special to the SFGATE"We're big cyclists, and when we heard the cycling community was doing this we knew we had to be here,” said Asia R. of Mountain View. Zip-tied to her bike read a sign that said "Justice for George Floyd."
