But the vote was delayed until Thursday after the death of Mayor Ted Wheeler's mother.Wheeler outlined his proposal to cut three police units — transit, school resource officers and the gun violence reduction team — on Tuesday.But many leaders of recent protests say the proposed budget cuts are not sufficient to end police violence and systemic racism."The time is now to disband PPB,” said Anna Swanson, an organizer of the demonstration outside City Hall at Terry Schrunk Plaza.As the event unfolded, city councilors listened to virtual testimony about the proposal. Hundreds of people had signed up to talk.Meanwhile, more than 1,000 people converged outside City Hall to call for deeper cuts to the police force.Two local groups, Don't Shoot PDX and Care Not Cops, organized the rally. The groups issued a 13-point list of demands Tuesday night that includes immediately cutting $50 million from the police bureau's budget, an amount seven times higher than Wheeler proposed."We want (the funding) reinvested in the black community, with the vision of black people,” said Rory Miah, an organizer with Care Not Cops.Miah listed some priorities for the money, such as housing, rent assistance, mental health care and "reparations, most importantly.”Don't Shoot PDX and Care Not Cops also want city officials to reduce the size of the police force, stop hiring new officers and leave open positions unfilled. The groups are calling for the end of police units and tactics that have disproportionately affected people of color.They want the city to stop using force to respond to break up crowds during protests. Police have used tear gas, stun grenades, rubber bullets and ear-piercing noise on protesters at various points during the last two weeks.Don't Shoot PDX sued the city last week. As a result, a federal judge granted a 14-day restraining order Tuesday barring police from using tear gas unless officers believe someone's life is at risk.Speaking to the crowd, Anna So urged the City Council to commit to disbanding the city's police force. She said the mayor's current police budget proposal is "basically the same” as it was."We're fighting for people's lives,” said So, who is with Care Not Cops.Lilith Sinclair, a community organizer, pressed the mayor and other councilors to be accountable to the public and end closed-door meetings where decisions are made."I'm tired of talking about the numbers,” Sinclair said, referring to the budget changes. "Maybe instead of talking about the numbers, we can talk about police putting their guns down.”Peggy Zebroski, 70, of Portland, stood among the crowd. Zebroski gained prominence after she sued the city for injuries she sustained in 2017 during a protest over a fatal police shooting. A jury ultimately decided not to award her any money."When we say abolish the police, it's not dissolving the police force right now," she said. "We know the root of crime is the terrible inequality people suffer under.”But she said the current proposed cuts to the police force amount to "coffee and cookies” at meetings.Kayla Washington, whose father Jason Washington was shot and killed by Portland State police in 2018, asked the crowd for help to continue putting pressure to cut back and disarm Portland State's police force.Washington referenced the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, which set off protests nationwide and ultimately led the Minneapolis city council members to pledge drastic cuts to police."The time has come to see it happens in our own community,” Washington said.Sophia Glenn, who said her brother was killed by police in Ohio, fought off tears as she spoke to the crowd."The brokenness that you feel is unimaginable,” Glenn said. "Even though I've been through it, it's like the Twilight Zone. You just don't know how it could have possibly happened. And it's so unnecessary.”Ndem Nkem was among those who had gathered. Nkem said he attends peaceful rallies as often as possible to affect change."I don't want any other young children and people to just feel like they are scared on the street,” Nkem said. "I still feel like a target sometimes, too, walking down the street, walking behind certain people. I feel like I could be a target to somebody, so I want to end that feeling.”Everton Bailey Jr. and Sean Meagher of The Oregonian/OregonLive contributed to this report.
