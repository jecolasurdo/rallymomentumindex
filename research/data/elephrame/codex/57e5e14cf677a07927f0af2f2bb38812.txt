"Make no mistake," said Indianapolis resident Musa Burki. "What happened yesterday was an act of domestic terrorism."Hundreds of people filled the stairs of Monument Circle on Sunday evening to sit in solidarity with the victims of Charlottesville. Many wore black and held white candles.Sunday morning:The story of Charlottesville told in debrisWhat we now know:Car rams Charlottesville crowd after protestsIn Indiana:Lawmakers react to violence at Charlottesville protestKey player:This Indiana man is in the middle of the 'Unite the Right' rally in CharlottesvilleA weekend of rallies and protests in Charlottesville began Friday night, when a few hundred white supremacists marched through the heart of the University of Virginia's campus with lit tiki torches. On Saturday, hundreds of protesters and counter-protesters descended.Around 2 p.m., a car drove into a group of people, killing 32-year-old Heather Heyer and sending 19 others to the hospital. The driver has been taken into custody. Later, a Virginia State Police helicopter crashed and two people on board were reportedly killed. So what's coming next? More conversation, a handful of people said. A revolution, a couple thought. A civil war, another person said."We must organize and prepare for the warfare on our doorstep," Cambria York said to the crowd. "There is no room for fence-sitters or bystanders in this fight."A few voices shouted back: "Peace."Among the "Love trumps hate" and "Black lives matter" signs one read: "Make racists scared again." Burki said he came to represent Muslims and, by way of introduction, told the crowd he was born and raised in Indianapolis — and is "as American as high fructose corn syrup." "The hidden blessing in all of this is... coming together in one voice and saying no to racism, no to bigotry," Burki said. But he also told IndyStar afterward that he is "extremely worried" about the future. "It's sad to say, but sometimes you think it's only a matter of time," he said, referencing the violence in Charlottesville. "We've seen how words turn into actions."There did not appear to be any organized counter protest to counter the Sunday event in Indianapolis."We have nothing to lose but our chains," the crowd chanted. They also paid tribute to Aaron Bailey, an unarmed black motorist who was killed by two Indianapolis police officers in June.Paula Frantz and her husband, Marc, waived white paper birds over their heads. The birds represent peace, Frantz said.The couple said they are disappointed to be at another vigil, holding another candle. They remember doing the same thing nearly 50 years ago after the Kent State shooting.But this time more people seem to be listening to each other, Frantz said.Nine Indianapolis groups came together to host the gathering Sunday evening, including Showing Up for Racial Justice Indianapolis, Indy10 Black Lives Matter, Women's March on Washington - Indiana and Jewish Voice for Peace - Indiana.Similar gatherings happened across the country.Call IndyStar reporter Emma Kate Fittes at (317) 513-7854.
