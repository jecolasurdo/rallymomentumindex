Ralph Northam by name because the group focuses on addressing the issue of racism as a whole. (Amelia Heymann) Moral Mondays protesters stood in front of Merchants Square with signs saying "Black Lives Matter” and "Redemption” — however, none of them mentioned Gov. Ralph Northam by name. John Whitley, who started Moral Mondays locally, said they didn't name Northam specifically as that could be viewed as partisan, and the governor is only one part of the greater issue of racism in Virginia. Advertisement "We never, ever bring a name forward,” said John Whitley. "What we're dealing with is the reality of what we must do when we face moments like this.” "We've had so many opportunities to criticize Trump,” another protestor added behind him, but the group has never put his name on a sign. Advertisement Whitley said what is most important to the group is dealing with reconciliation and reparations for racism in the commonwealth as a whole, and not to telescope into a single issue. "What do you gain just simply tossing a person out of office when the conversation in this community ... needs to go much deeper around economic issues, education issues, health, environment, minimum wage, living wage ... and having a better relationship with the elements of our community,” Whitley said. "Is there a black legislator in Williamsburg? When's the last time there was one? There hasn't been.” Recommended on Daily Press Advertisement Latest The Virginia Gazette News Virginia Government & Politics Northam announces increased funding, guidelines for reopening long-term care facilities 2h Health & Medicine Percentage of positive coronavirus tests in Virginia trends down again 11:15 AM Local Government & Politics Most Hampton Roads localities will close for "Juneteenth,” but not York County Jun 18, 2020 Advertisement Most Read on Daily Press Food & Drink Steve's Steak House in Newport News is closed after 50 years Jun 18, 2020 Hampton Roads History Contraband slaves seek freedom at Fort Monroe Jan 14, 2013 Advertisement Most Read • NEWS See more Most Read • NEWS articles U.S. Military News Air Force makes history: 1st woman as top enlisted leader 52m Virginia Government & Politics Northam announces increased funding, guidelines for reopening long-term care facilities 2h News Dirty Buffalo owner takes stand against systemic racism, rallies community for downtown Norfolk march 3h Advertisement Advertisement
