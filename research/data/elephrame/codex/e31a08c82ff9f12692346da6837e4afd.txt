Black Lives Matter stages Toronto school walkout by News Staff Posted May 1, 2017 11:27 am EDT Last Updated May 1, 2017 at 1:17 pm EDT Members of Black Lives Matter along with GTA teachers held a demonstration at York Woods Library in Toronto on May 1, 2017. CITYNEWS/Bryan Carey Teachers, parents, and members of Black Lives Matter held a walkout and subsequent demonstration in Toronto on Monday, protesting what they say is "anti-Black racism in Toronto schools.” The protest comes the week after a report found that Black students were twice as likely to be enrolled in applied (instead of academic) high school courses. They were also more likely to be suspended. In a statement on Monday, Black Lives Matter – Toronto (BLMTO) also singled out the case of a Black six-year-old girl, who was handcuffed by two Peel police officers inside her school. Earlier this year, CityNews reporter Cynthia Mulligan spoke to the girl's mother, who said "No six-year-old little girl deserves that ... she's a good kid.” The mother's lawyers believe anti-Black racism is the underlying cause of the troubles. "There's never, ever a situation where a six-year-old should be handcuffed, never,” said Danardo Jones. Monday's demonstration was held at York Woods Library, near Jane Street and Finch Avenue. The demonstration included a series of workshops for parents on teachers on topics like navigating the school system, responding to suspensions and expulsions, and dealing with the Children's Aid Society. In a statement, one teacher said they were "sick and tired” of always dealing with the same problems. "As a teacher, I am sick and tired of seeing these issues go unaddressed,” teacher Hawa Sabriye said. "We will not continue to participate uncritically in an institution that habitually abuses Black children. We're demanding better for Black children, now!” Another parent said it wasn't just anti-Black racism that concerned her. It was also anti-Muslim sentiment. "I send my child to school to learn, and they should be guaranteed a safe environment when they're there,” said Sindi de La Cruz, a parent in the Jane and Finch area. "But with what's going on now with anti-Black and Islamophobic school board trustees and administrators, I am terrified for my children each day.” Related stories: Exclusive: Mom outraged after six-year-old daughter handcuffed by police in school Exclusive: Peel police to review case of girl, 6, handcuffed in school YRDSB fires embattled Director of Education York school board slammed in report on racism, Islamophobia Listen Now 680 News Live LOCAL NATIONAL Protestors paint 'Defund The Police' in front of Toronto police headquarters Jun 19, 2020, 3:51 PM Milton jail guard alleges two colleagues attacked him after comments on George Floyd Jun 19, 2020, 3:38 PM 'Dr. 6ix' tells regulator he now realizes he acted against patient's interest Jun 19, 2020, 3:34 PM CFIA investigating after shipment of dead dogs arrives at Pearson Airport Jun 19, 2020, 2:35 PM Mom killed with 3 daughters in Brampton crash was teacher, board confirms Jun 19, 2020, 12:56 PM 1 man dead following shooting in Corso Italia neighbourhood Jun 19, 2020, 12:19 PM Animal rights activist killed while protesting pigs en route to slaughterhouse Jun 19, 2020, 4:49 PM Ottawa announces 'unprecedented action' to protect Fraser River chinook Jun 19, 2020, 4:45 PM Funeral held for Indigenous man killed last week by RCMP in New Brunswick Jun 19, 2020, 4:00 PM Commons rule on MP arrests not followed, Trudeau says over charges against MP Jun 19, 2020, 2:58 PM N.L. liquor corp. reviewing Old Sam Rum in light of racist branding concerns Jun 19, 2020, 2:09 PM Calgary company sorry for Black Lives Matter gelato, calls flavour choice 'ignorant' Jun 13, 2020, 8:27 PM LIFE SPORTSNET ENTERTAINMENT For residential school survivor Phyllis Webstad, the colour orange is part of her 'healing journey' Jun 18, 2020, 11:58 AM 'Important to me to preserve the language,' Cree musician Adrian Sutherland says Jun 17, 2020, 1:23 PM 'Woodland' artist Patrick Hunter inspired by Indigenous languages in latest project Jun 16, 2020, 11:29 AM 'We are all related': Spiritual elder Philip Cote uses art to tell Indigenous stories Jun 15, 2020, 1:04 PM Athletes and sportcasters weigh in on anti-Black and systemic racism Jun 12, 2020, 4:28 PM 'Education for action' is what drives social justice activist Pamela Palmater Jun 12, 2020, 11:47 AM Lack of PPE, conflicting guidelines slow reopening of dental clinics Jun 11, 2020, 3:51 PM Author and journalist Tanya Talaga pushes for Indigenous rights Jun 11, 2020, 1:13 PM Your thoughts on anti-Black and systemic racism Jun 10, 2020, 5:31 PM 'Hamilton' a record-breaking hit before box office even opened: Mirvish Oct 28, 2019, 12:27 PM Raptors still planning to begin training in Florida next weekJust moments agoPinder and Steinberg: NHL First and Second Team All-Stars12 minutes agoWhat do positive COVID-19 tests mean for baseball moving forward? | Tim and Sid18 minutes agoSports On Pause podcast: Making the worst of a bad situation23 minutes agoDavid Pagnotta: NHL concerned Toronto can't accommodate containment protocol for hub city51 minutes ago Judge weighs US bid to stop release of John Bolton's book Jun 19, 2020, 3:48 PM Cineplex to stick with optional face masks policy, as U.S. theatres reconsider Jun 19, 2020, 2:51 PM AMC Theaters reverses course on masks after backlash Jun 19, 2020, 1:45 PM Two-time winner Elaine McArthur nominated again at Indigenous Voices Awards Jun 19, 2020, 1:27 PM Lithuania erects sculpture in honour of JD Salinger Jun 19, 2020, 11:56 AM About Us Contact Mobile App Advertise with us Privacy Policy Terms of Service Ad Choices Political Ads Registry 333 Bloor Street East, Toronto, Ontario M4W 1G9 © 2002-2020 Rogers Media.
