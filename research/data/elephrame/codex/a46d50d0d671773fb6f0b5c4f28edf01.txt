They then walked to various downtown Ypsilanti street corners carrying black flags and signs with the names of those killed during interactions with police and statements including "Police with a gun must have a camera," "End Police Violence," and Black Lives Matter."The gathering, titled "The Space Between: On the Ground for Michael Brown," remembered Michael Brown and others who have died in altercations with law enforcement, including Ann Arbor resident Aura Rosser.Ferguson officer Darren Wilson shot and killed 18-year-old Brown on Aug. 9, 2014 after an altercation between the two. Some witnesses offered differing accounts of who the aggressor was in the shooting and a grand jury announced in November 2014 that it would not indict Wilson in Brown's death.In January, Washtenaw County Prosecutor Brian Mackie's announced the decision not to charge police officer David Ried in the fatal shooting of 40-year-old Aura Rosser on Nov. 9, 2014, saying the killing was justified.Ann Arbor police were called to Rosser's home after her boyfriend reported that she was attacking him.Mackie said in a previous release that Rosser was attacking her boyfriend when officer arrived at the scene. He said she ignored officer commands to drop a knife she was holding and "came at the officers with the knife still raised in an attack position" before being shot.Ann Arbor to Ferguson activist and University of Michigan graduate student Austin McCoy cited these and the publicized deaths of other black women and men, such as Sandra Bland and Eric Garner, as catalysts of the local movement."Over the last year many of us have come together to answer this provocation," McCoy said, praising those involved with area 'die-ins' and marches.Ypsilanti resident Akili Jackson, who read a poem at the event, said the event Sunday illustrated the ongoing nature of the Black Live Matter movement and the possibility for peaceful action."I wanted to take part in this because people took part in these before me to allow me to be where I am," he said.He said he believes action is still needed because transformation is still needed in policing techniques as it impacts black individuals, and all individuals."The diversity of the gathering shows that what's happening across the country is affecting everybody," he said. "Black lives matter, my son's life matters, the tears of mothers' matter."The crowd responded with cheers as Morgan stated that capitalism is the true enemy and said poverty was a common factor in the law enforcement involved deaths, as well as the recent deaths in Ypsilanti."I'm no Interrupter, but I want to interrupt injustice everywhere I see it," he said, referencing an Ypsilanti group developed in wake of the gang violence surrounding the death of 20-year-old Keandre Duff."We denounce violence in every form," he said.
