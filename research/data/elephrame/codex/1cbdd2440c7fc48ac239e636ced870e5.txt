"We were arrested and put in a paddy wagon."The group was carted down the block in the paddy wagon and released after citations were issued, Brooks said. The group has a common court date sometime in December, he said. Everyone was physically fine after the incident, he said."The NAACP has a long history of standing up for injustice by using all the tools for justice, common among which is civil disobedience," Brooks said. "Sometimes, the best way for us to send a message to law enforcement in Chicago was to break the law."The protest was intended to draw attention to the "culture of policing" in which an officer was able to go "400 days without being charged," Brooks said.The NAACP chief was referring to Chicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke, charged in the Oct. 20, 2014, shooting."This young man, Laquan McDonald, he may have been a ward of the state, but he's everybody's child and that represents a slice of Chicago," Brooks said.Ten people were arrested and cited with administrative notice of ordinance violations before being released, confirmed Chicago Officer Thomas Sweeny, a police spokesman. Sweeny did not immediately have the names of all the individuals who were cited.Contributing: Aamer Madhani in ChicagoAbout Us Newsroom Staff Ethical Principles Corrections Press Releases Accessibility Sitemap Terms of Service Your California Privacy Rights/Privacy Policy Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info/Cookie PolicyContact Us Help Center My Account Give Feedback Get Home Delivery eNewspaper USA TODAY Shop Reprints & Permissions Advertise Careers Internships Support Local BusinessNews Tips Podcasts Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter Instagram LinkedIn Pinterest YouTube Reddit Flipboard RSS10Best Grateful Reviewed Thanksgiving.com Job Network Moonlighting Sports Weekly Studio Gannett ClassifiedsThe City The Wall StorytellersÂ© 2020 USA TODAY, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network, LLC.
