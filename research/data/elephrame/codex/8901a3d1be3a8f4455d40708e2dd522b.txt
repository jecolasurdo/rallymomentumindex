Organisers said the Melbourne march was "a peaceful rally in solidarity with our brothers and sisters across the Pacific" to show that "all lives matter".They also said it highlighted the deaths of Indigenous Australians in custody.One speaker at the rally told the crowd: "People say to me 'Get back on the boat'. I didn't come here by boat, I came here by Qantas.""There is only one race, that is the human race," he said.The march was then led by mounted police along Swanston Street to Federation Square and staged a sit-in outside Flinders St station.
