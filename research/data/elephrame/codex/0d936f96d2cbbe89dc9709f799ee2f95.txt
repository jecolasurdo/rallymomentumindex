Jim Bloch — For MediaNews Group Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save "No justice, no peace!""I can't breathe!"The voices of the Black Lives Matter protest in Port Huron filled Pine Grove Park a thousand strong before the demonstrators marched onto Pine Grove Avenue, closed to traffic, and headed downtown to the municipal office center.- Advertisement - They carried signs stating: "Done asking." "Abolish the system." "We will not be silent."Ten days earlier, the death of George Floyd while in the custody of Minneapolis police sparked thousands of demonstrations around the globe, a development almost as stunning as the spread of the novel coronavirus around the same globe.On the video that dominated newscasts and social media, neighbors screamed at officer Derek Chauvin to remove his knee from the neck of Floyd, prone on the street, his hands cuffed behind his back."I can't breathe," pleaded Floyd, three desperate words that have become the tragic refrain of police brutality against black people in the second decade of the 21st century.Three other officers on the scene did not intervene. Floyd cried out for his mother, dead for two years. Eight minutes and 46 second later, Floyd, too, was dead."We know that in this county we have systems of oppression that have crippled the backs of black people," said Alphonso Amos, chair of Black Lives Matter Port Huron, addressing the big crowd in front of the municipal office center. "We know that in this city and this county there have been backdoor deals and things going on behind the scenes that have crippled the necks of black people too long."The crowd hollered.The date was June 5, the same day USA Today estimated that 700 cities in the U.S. had seen protests against police brutality and the seemingly endless grip of racism on modern society. To some, it seemed like an undercount.In Port Huron, the Black Lives Matter march was the third in six days, following a NAACP protest on June 4, and another rally on May 31. On June 6, high school students organized a fourth protest in the city.Port Huron did not appear on USA Today's map of protests.Allies"We need allies in this fight," Amos said.Black leaders and marchers in Port Huron had plenty of allies."I see people looking for change," said Amos from the steps of the municipal office center. "I see a community desperate for change. I see young people. I see more seasoned people — I won't call them old. I see white. I see black. I see mixed. I see some Asians and some Hispanics and Latinas. Standing for a cause that Black Lives Matter."The crowd shouted its approval. Amos introduced an ally, Bridget Huff."I come to you as an imperfect white woman, not unfamiliar with hardship, but still entirely steeped in privilege," said Huff, addressing the white people in the crowd. "From our first days setting foot in this land, we took, we lied, we killed, we owned. ... Racism is not a byproduct of our systems. Racism is a feature of our systems. The system is working exactly as it was designed to. ... I, like you, move through this world in a bubble of protection I did not earn, based solely upon my appearance, based solely on this country awarding whiteness, based solely on the racist society that grants us favor."Huff requested that white people "humbly ask black leaders, 'How can I help your fight?'”Learn to "understand that those closest to the pain should be closest to the power," Huff said. "We lose nothing by amplifying black voices. They don't need white saviors. Our job, white people, is to witness, honor and to get out of the way."She quoted indigenous Australian activist Lilla Watson: "If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together."'8 Can't Wait'A number of Port Huron police officers marched with the crowd."We can't change anything if we pretend there are no problems," said a speaker in Pine Grove Park. "If you had a problem with something somebody did, if you felt profiled when you were pulled over, if you felt an officer talked to you the wrong way, express that. You can express that without being angry, without being frustrated, without being mad. There are things going on in Port Huron."Chief Joe Platzer spoke to the crowd in front of the municipal office center. So did St. Clair County Sheriff Tim Donnellon."Today, we're united as one," said Donnellon. "That's St. Clair County. Like it or not, we're in this together."As Donnellon proclaimed his love of the river and the county's residents, a number of people began shouting "Black Lives Matter" in unison until Amos asked the crowd to let Donnellon finish."What I need to hear from our officials is real change," said another speaker.He referred to the "8 Can't Wait" campaign for immediate changes that police departments can make in advance of full or partial defunding: Ban chokeholds and strangleholds; require active de-escalation of conflicts; require a warning before shooting; exhaust all other means before shooting; make a duty to intervene in a bad situation mandatory for other officers; ban shooting at moving vehicles; require a use of force continuum; and require comprehensive reporting of shooting incidents."We can't just hold officials accountable," he said. "We have to hold each other accountable."Organizers handed out cards that directed people to blacklivesmatter.com for information and resources about racism and the opposition to it."We aren't going to come here today and pretend everything is all right," said Amos. "If you don't confront the issues head on, they're going to keep happening."Jim Bloch is a freelance writer. Contact him at bloch.jim@gmail.com.
