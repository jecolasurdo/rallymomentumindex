But instead of beach balls, they held white flowers and phone flashlights.The group of students and adults gathered in memory of Stephon Clark in a vigil organized by the Collier Students for Change, with help from the advocacy group Collier Freedom.Clark, a black man, was killed by police in his grandmother's backyard in Sacramento, California, on March 18. Officers said they believed the unarmed Clark was reaching for a gun and shot him eight times.Collier Students for Change has not held any vigil or protest in reaction to a police shooting. The group was formed to advocate stricter gun laws in response to the mass shooting at Parkland's Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School."Gun control is not just about citizens, but it also applies to police officers,” said Stefica Milor, a Naples High School senior and Collier Students for Change member. "A lot of times, they pull out their guns too quick in certain circumstances. I understand their line of work is dangerous, but there is an epidemic lately, and police are shooting people, getting away with it, and it's really not necessary."So I feel the gun control idea should apply to police officers as well,” Milor continued.Local events in response to police shootings could become more common as the student organization looks to expand its mission and attempt to stem the nationwide shootings.K.C. Schulber, of Collier Freedom, helped the students host the vigil and agreed Clark's shooting falls under their umbrella of stricter gun laws."It's part of the larger issue of gun violence in America,” he said. "Because it happened so quickly after March for our Lives, they felt they wanted to do a vigil for them.”During the vigil, several speakers passed a bullhorn before the group, who held banners reading "Stand Together for Sensible Gun Laws” and "March for our Lives.” They shared personal experiences and spoke of equality among all races, some people wearing "Black Lives Matter” shirts.The group then walked to the water's edge as the sun set.Staff Directory Corrections Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Public Notices Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My AccountSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJob Network Cars Homes Classifieds Education Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2020 www.naplesnews.com.
