Protesters jammed Union Square and clashed with NYPD officers as they marched through the streets of New York City in solidarity with Baltimore activists Wednesday night, briefly shutting down the Holland Tunnel and snarling traffic along the West Side Highway - resulting in at least 100 arrests. What began as a small gathering at Union Square around 6 p.m. swelled to more than 1,000 people, many holding "Justice 4 Freddie Gray" placards while chanting "Black Lives Matter" and continued into the early hours Thursday.

NYPD officers, many wearing riot helmets and carrying handfuls of plastic cuffs, were seen loading several activists into police vans.

He came to the protest with his roommate. "I got a baton to the temple and my roommate got a baton to the stomach," said Carmack, who claims cops retaliated when a protester hurled a water bottle at them.

Marchers were warned to stay off the street and not to block traffic or risk getting arrested. The NYPD handed out flyers and announced their rules of engagement with an audio recording. It didn't deter the likes of Nes Roberts, 40, from Flatbush.
