By: Associated Press Posted at 2:11 PM, Jul 21, 2014 and last updated 2014-07-21 14:11:29-04 NEW YORK (AP) — A group of demonstrators is calling for the resignation of New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton. The group, known as "New Yorkers Against Bratton," held a small protest Monday outside City Hall. Protesters said Bratton needs to be fired after the death of a Staten Island man in police custody. The NYPD did not immediately respond to a comment request. Eric Garner died Thursday after he was arrested for selling loose cigarettes. A video of the incident appears to show a police officer place Garner in a chokehold. Garner, an asthmatic, can be heard saying "I can't breathe." The chokehold is banned by the NYPD. The medical examiner has not determined a cause of death. Two police officers and four FDNY emergency workers have been reassigned. Copyright 2020 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
