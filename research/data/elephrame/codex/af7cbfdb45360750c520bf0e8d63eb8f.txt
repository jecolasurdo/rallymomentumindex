SEPTA Police Chief Thomas Nestel described the event as "peaceful.”"There were many people at the march tonight but there should have been so many more,” says Northern Liberties resident Marion Leary. "People were holding signs such as 'Not Another Hashtag' and signs with the names of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling. People were angry and sad, but also someone thanked me and my friend for being there and showing solidarity. Overall, though, there was the feeling of 'enough!' and 'not again!' and 'no more!'”Marchers just turned into market and are heading east @6abc pic.twitter.com/xyT152Q31i— Christie Ileto (@Christie_Ileto) July 7, 2016Leary says she started to tear up as the crowd chanted, "Hands up ... Don't shoot!”"It is just so sad,” she says.As of 10 p.m. on Thursday night, there were no reports of arrests.Follow @VictorFiorillo on Twitter.
