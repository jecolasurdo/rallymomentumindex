It appeared that they were blocking the intersection of Magnolia Avenue and Main Street. The protests may be begun just after 9:30 p.m. Friday. Olango, 38, was shot and killed on Sept. 27 during an encounter with ECPD officers Richard Gonsalves and Josh McDaniel in the parking lot of a shopping center in the 800 block of Broadway in El Cajon. According to police, Olango was acting "erratically” and had refused to comply with the officers' orders to remove his hands out of the pockets of his pants. They said Olango pulled a 4-inch vaping device from his pocket and pointed it at Gonsalves and McDaniel in what police described as a "shooting stance.” McDaniel deployed a Taser at Olango while Gonsalves fired multiple rounds from his gun. Olango's death sparked days of protests on the streets of El Cajon, some of which were peaceful while others turned violent. No other information was immediately available.
