BLM LA The peaceful demonstration of more than 50,000 people began Sunday on Hollywood Blvd ... and the aerial views were epic. YG teamed up with BLM LA and joined activist and BLM co-founder Patrisse Cullors at the front of the crowd to share some words and explain the importance of using his voice.

Much of the crowd came equipped with face masks, homemade BLM signs and messaging to remember the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and so many other black people killed by police.

Speaking of which, police presence during the march was minimal, and it remained a totally peaceful event. Play video content PLAYIN' TO THE CROWD Other celebs in attendance included Jamie Foxx, J Lo, A-Rod, Machine Gun Kelly, Vanessa Hudgens, Mod Sun, Margaret Qualley, Kaia Gerber, Michael Rappaport, Madeline Petsch, Karreuche Tran, Ireland Baldwin and Marlon Wayans.

Mayor Eric Garcetti. Lizzo, Kehlani and Common were among those who marched ... it was shortly after that protest when Garcetti announced an enormous, $150 million cut, from the LAPD's budget. Of course, the L.A. protests were not the only ones over the weekend ... as several major cities and small towns in the U.S. kept the demonstrations going in a continued show of support for ending systemic racism and police brutality.
