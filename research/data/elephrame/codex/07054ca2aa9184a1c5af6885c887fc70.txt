"The problem here is the officer stepped across the line. It sheds some light on gun violence. Guns in America create problems for Americans."The protest in Kalamazoo coincided with numerous others unfolding across the country in an effort to address peace and justice, the death of teenager Michael Brown in Missouri and the increased militarization of local police forces, event organizer Shannon Sykes said.Pastor Strick Strickland, Kalamazoo Gay and Lesbian Resource Center executive director Jay Maddock, 60th District state House candidate Jon Hoadley and Kalamazoo City Commissioner Stephanie Moore all gave brief speeches during the protest."Hands up, don't shoot!" commissioner Moore shouted repeatedly during her speech. "Today is a day that we stand together, not for revenge, but for justice. Today is the day we say we are sick and tired of being sick and tired. Our lives have value, each and every one of us.""You can never take back the loss of life," Sykes said. "I know that there are varying details about what occurred, what Michael Brown might have been involved with beforehand, but any time you have a young man surrender, it's time to put the guns down.""We're here because regardless of what the details are, a mother lost her son," said Sykes, a Kalamazoo resident and mother of two African-American sons.It is important to erase stereotypes and overcome bias about individuals, regardless of their skin color, for society to move forward, she said."What I think happens is that we have our stereotypes about each other -- don't get me wrong, we all do it," Sykes said. "I'm guilty of this. We tend to see skin color before we do humanity. So I think what happens is especially for young black men, we very often see their skin color and see them as a threat."Police brutality and the militarization of local police forces also needs to be addressed, Sykes said. While police should be equipped with guns and bullet proof vests, "What we don't need is these vehicles that are set up to drive through Iraq, on our city streets," she said. "So there's a point where you go too far. There is a difference between making sure we're protected and making sure we're effective."Hoadley said he think Kalamazoo residents would welcome chances to work with law enforcement and each other to create solutions to curb violence."I'm optimistic that when we work together, when the best of humans in our communities come together, we can solve really big problems including issues of bias and violence and anger," he said. "But we have to be willing to all work together to get that done and support the people that are doing it.""The response (in Missouri), which has been so well documented and clear, has been excessive," he said. "When we saw shooting into neighborhoods, when we saw tanks, these are the concerns that to me shows that there was not a thoughtful plan, there was not an active set of listening."The solution, Hoadley said, is not "more violence for violence."Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
