The protesters, however, moved to the 1800 block and that's when things started to go wrong."They began to walk in the middle of the street, blocking the flow of traffic, impeding traffic," Edwards said. "A lot of the citizens who were in the area had difficulty passing, and so at that moment we needed to make a decision about how to engage them."Shabazz was handcuffed and put into the police van. Southall was down on the ground, surrounded by officers while he hurled curse words and racially-based accusations against them.Edwards said that "no unnecessary force" was used in the arrests."We thought that the officers were extremely professional with them even though those three individuals that were arrested, they were a little bit non-compliant," Edwards said."It took just a little bit more than we were expecting, but it was very peaceful," he said.Birmingham police also are investigating a suspicious package, which is a large, black plastic egg with a face painted on it, left on the AL.com's doorstep about the same time the protest started.Al.com employees were told to evacuate the building just before 2:30 p.m.Madison Underwood contributed to this report.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).Â© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
