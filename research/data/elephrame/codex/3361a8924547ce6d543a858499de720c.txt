Williams attended most of the protests on Saturday and spoke one-on-one with angry protesters.Dozens of protesters demonstrated on Saturday, including about 40 from Ferguson, where police shot another black man.The Missouri protestors arrived late Friday at a Motel 6 in Middleburg Heights, where an off-duty motel manager slapped four protesters, according to Middleburg Heights Police Chief John Maddox.Maddox said the protesters did nothing wrong and were not protesting at the time. The manager was charged with four counts of assault, Maddox said.Protests began about 10:30 a.m. on Saturday at Cudell Recreation Center, where a rookie Cleveland police officer fatally shot 12-year-old Tamir Rice on Nov. 22 while investigating a complaint of someone with a gun.The gun turned out to be fake and the shooting has since sparked about a month of protests.The group then went to the Steelyard Commons Walmart, where they blocked the entrances and prompted the store to close for several hours.Williams was surrounded outside one entrance. At one point he told Tavon Rice that he was going to "make sure you guys are safe today" and told another protester that "you have every right to be doing what you're doing, as long as you're doing it peacefully."The group then went to Public Square, where police and security closed Tower City. No one was allowed in or out of the building until the protesters left.The group walked to Playhouse Square, where traffic was blocked. They then went to the East 9th Street, near the entrance ramps to the Shoreway.About two-dozen Cleveland police officers and some 15 cruisers blocked protesters from going onto the highway. Protesters, after shouting at police officers for several minutes, eventually left and went to the nearby Justice Center.During the final protest of the day — in the neighborhood around East 40th Street and Community College Parkway— more than a dozen officers and 10 police cruisers blocked the road that led to Mayor Frank Jackson's home.The 50 protesters that remained during the final protest, never crossed the police-car barricade and eventually ended the protest about 8:30 p.m.More protests are scheduled for Sunday. Organizers said they plan to meet in Public Square about 3 p.m. and protest outside Quicken Loans Arena before the Cavaliers host the Memphis Grizzlies.Northeast Ohio Media Group reporter Eric Heisig contributed to this report.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
