But that didn't stop local police officers working security at the game from walking out.After the game, The Seattle Times reports the Storm joined a "media blackout" started by the New York Liberty and Indiana Fever after those teams were fined, where they refused to answer questions about the game and only spoke about issues pertaining to racial violence.Advertisement"We all have fathers, uncles, brothers, cousins, everybody who can be in this situation," player Alysha Clark told the Times. "Race is a very uncomfortable topic to talk about in the United States. A lot of people don't want to have it. But as the events have been unfolding here and in the last couple of years, there is a problem that needs to be addressed."Share This StoryGet our newsletterSubscribeAdvertisement
