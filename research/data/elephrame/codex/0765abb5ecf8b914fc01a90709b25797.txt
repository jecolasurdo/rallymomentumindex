Al Sharpton and Eric Garner's family members, marched Saturday in support of the 43-year-old Port Richmond man who died following an incident with police in Tompkinsville on Thursday.Marchers rallied 1.5 miles, from the small Mount Sinai Center on Jersey Street in New Brighton to the 120th Precinct stationhouse in St. George, where crowds chanted Garner's last words, "I can't breathe!" at the building's steps.The rally — marked by chants of "No justice, no peace," "120's gotta go" and "NYPD, no more killing" — culminated with words from Eric's daughter, Emerald Garner, and his mother, Gwen Carr, who thanked all in attendance."This shows just how much [Eric Garner] was loved," said an emotional Ms. Carr from the steps of the 120th Precinct stationhouse. "Keep your children close. This is a terrible feeling to feel. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy."Political figures, family members and community activists held a pre-rally press conference at Mount Sinai. Rev. Sharpton insisted that this was not a "drive-by protest" and that "we will be here until what we see in that tape is clear in the halls of justice."Garner was a staple in Tompkinsville, where he made a living selling bootleg cigarettes."He had no guns, no charges for guns, robberies — nothing. For a cigarette? Are you serious?" Emerald Garner said at the afternoon presser. "Many stores that sell illegal cigarettes — they lose their license; he lost his life."Garner and his wife, Esaw, had six children together. Their oldest son, Eric Jr., 18, just graduated from Curtis High School and will attend Essex County College on a full basketball scholarship."My son misses his dad. He's leaving for college in August ... and his father won't be able to see him step in that school for the first day of school," Mrs. Garner said at the press conference. "He was looking forward to dropping him off at college so he can make a better life. That's the type of dad he was. He was a proud father."Public Advocate Letitia James said she is seeking answers as to why the banned choke hold was "used so reflexively by a veteran police officer.""This will test the mettle of our city," Ms. James said. Of Garner, she added, "Maybe a man who was so beloved in life can teach us a lesson in death."Marista Sayon knows that lesson. She's the mother of Ernest Sayon, a Staten Island man who died during a struggle with police officers in Clifton 20 years ago. She came to offer her support to the Garner family."I love the way the community is holding together," Ms. Sayon said. "I know what [the Garners] are going through and I hope they get justice."Unlike Sayon's case, and most other cases involving high-profile allegations of police brutality, Garner's death was captured on video.Invoking Warner Wolf, Rev. Sharpton said the video doesn't lie. "Go to the tape," he chanted at Mount Sinai."We don't have to argue, just go to the tape...We've been to the tape. And the tape speaks for itself," he said to those gathered at Mount Sinai. "From what I saw in the video, [the police] disrespected [Garner's] humanity."Ramsey Orta, 22, shot the footage of Garner's death. He's become close with the Garners since the incident. During the rally at the 120th Precinct, Orta couldn't find a space on the building's steps, where family and rally leaders gave their closing remarks to the crowd. Garner's sister, Ellisha Garner, made sure he had standing room."Let him up. He's family," Ms. Garner said.Orta said he had witnessed altercations between Garner and police on several occasions."I watched that man get harassed by police for four years and I had to do something," said Orta, explaining his decision to record Thursday's incident. "I'm just happy that what happened was exposed. If there wasn't a video, it would have been swept right under the rug."Manhattanite Bill Dobbs was rallying for Garner and also to highlight the importance of photography and videography in Garner's death. He marched with a sign that read, "Cell phones for Police Accountability. Stop arresting videographers.""The video [of Garner's death] makes a huge difference," he said. "Without it, this would be unfolding in an entirely different way."Garner's family and supporters must now wait for the results of an official investigation into the incident, led by District Attorney Daniel Donovan.Councilwoman Debi Rose spoke at the Mount Sinai press conference, assuring that the investigation into Garner's death will be conducted with the utmost responsibility."I promise there will be a thorough and transparent investigation," Ms. Rose said. "No one deserves to die or be killed with regards to what happened. Someone who could have been given a ticket is now dead."Despite the outrage directed at police, marchers were confident in the city and the current administration to conduct a fair investigation."Unfortunately this police behavior is the norm, but I'm confident that justice will be brought," said Mariners Harbor residentS.ABelton, as she marched with her three grandchildren. "This is about them. Our time has passed but we must make sure that something like this doesn't happen to our grandkids."Back at Mount Sinai, Emerald Garner stood up for the New York Police Department."There are officers with good hearts. And once one officer does something bad to somebody, everybody looks at all of them wrong," she said. "And it's sad. I feel bad for them."But Ms. Garner doesn't want what happened to her father to happen again in New York City."Like Eric said, 'This will end today,'" she said.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
