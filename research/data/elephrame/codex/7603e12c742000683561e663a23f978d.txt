Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao - were fired. Four days after his death, Chauvin was charged with third-degree murder.This week, the charge was upgraded to second-degree murder. Kueng, Lane and Thao were each charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter.Chauvin, a 44-year-old officer who served with the Minneapolis Police Department for nearly 19 years was subject to at least 18 prior complaints, department internal affairs records show.The day of Floyd's death, Chauvin was assigned to train Kueng, a new member of the Minneapolis Police Deparmtent who was working his third shift as a police officer.Floyd's death sparked protests nationwide, with protests held in each of the country's 50 states. More than 10,000 people have been arrested in the protests, with the county growing by the hundreds daily.
