Price Maria ClarkThe American SouthNEW ORLEANS — Protests continued nationwide and in pockets across New Orleans from morning to evening in the days following the death of George Floyd.Demonstrators moved peacefully though the Uptown district and close to 1,000 marched along downtown streets toward the New Orleans Police headquarters and Orleans Parish Prison.Several in the crowd carrying signs that read, "No Justice No Peace” and "Say his name! George Floyd.""I'm here to make them see we are here with Minneapolis — we are here in solidarity as a community,” said Andrew Miragliotta who went to the rally with his wife Jenna Miragliotta.As organizers started leading the crowd in a chant of No Justice No Peace, Jenna Miragliottta said, "white silence is perpetuating this and it keeps happening. We are bringing our bodies, our voices to support and show up. Visibility matters.” More:George Floyd protests: How did we get here?Earlier Saturday morning as joggers and bicyclists circled Audubon Park's oak-shaded path, a group of about 100 protesters gathered. They carried signs that read "let them breathe,” "rest in peace George Floyd” and "police brutality is the deadliest virus.” Marching down the sidewalk, clumping together in violation of social distancing guidelines but mainly wearing masks, they chanted in a call and response "Black Lives Matter,” "No crooked police” and "Don't kneel on me.”The group, mainly white, female and young, continued down Magazine Street, passing the wealthy area's pristinely maintained historic houses. The park and the surrounding neighborhood, like all of Uptown New Orleans near the river, had once been plantations where black men and women were enslaved. A few cars honked in support of the marchers. A driver gave the protesters a thumbs up. Police cars were parked on the side streets every few blocks."The world is crazy and there needs to be change,” said Hanna, one of the protesters. She refused to give her last name. Hanna said that she was willing to risk the danger of COVID-19 contagion to protest. "I'm more worried about men like my husband getting killed,” said Hanna, who is white and married to a black man. The marchers returned to the park and marched down the main path. People out exercising talked about the protest after it passed."All lives matter,” said a white middle-aged white woman to her walking companion. Then, a little louder so a reporter could overhear clearly, she added, "It's the press that causes the division.”More protests across the South:Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms pleads for peace amid fiery George Floyd protestsOn the other side of town, a group of roughly 15 gathered at the corner of Esplanade and Claiborne avenues, where a larger group of about 50 had gathered the day before.A regular stream of honks encouraged the protesters. A rack had been set up on the neutral ground displaying T-shirts printed with Black Lives Matter slogans and the images of Travon Martin and the jailed activist Mumia Abu-Jamal.An older white woman knelt before a traffic light pole, taping up sheets of papers with the names of black men and women killed by police: George Floyd, Alton Sterling, Tony McDade, Breonna Taylor.Updates:Former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin arrested, charged with murder in George Floyd's deathThe day ended with a 5 p.m. rally in Duncan Plaza, the park in front of City Hall. A crowd of 1,500, nearly all wearing masks, showed up. As the speakers began, everyone moved to the center of the bowl-like park, packing in tightly like a festival crowd.The organizers began with instructions for attendees should they be arrested. They had everyone repeat in unison a number to call for legal help. The speakers spoke about police brutality, rent strikes and trans rights. One woman took the mic and sung in a tone like a mantra "Black trans lives are sacred. We matter."Throughout the rally, the NOPD had no visible presence. Officers and their cars were stationed around the corner and a block away.Then, the mic was handed over to any black person who wanted to speak."White people, thank you for being here and showing your empathy, but I'm going to tell you it's not enough," said one speaker to the crowd that was three quarters white. "We are tired of facing every injustice alone."At the end of the nearly two and half hour rally, a chant of "black lives matter" ended the gathering. The organizers encouraged everyone to leave in pairs for safety. Most of the crowd filed away. A few stayed to talk with friends as the sun set in New Orleans.Todd Price and Maria Clark are reporters with The American South.Story ideas, tips, questions? Email Todd at taprice@gannett.com.
