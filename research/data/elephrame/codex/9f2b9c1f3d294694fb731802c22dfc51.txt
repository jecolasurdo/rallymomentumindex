George Floyd: Hundreds at New Paltz rally call for change, solidarity amid violenceKatelyn Cordero, Poughkeepsie Journal Published 6:55 p.m. ET May 30, 2020 | Updated 5:13 p.m. ET June 1, 2020CLOSE Hundreds took to the streets of downtown New Paltz Saturday to protest the killing of George Floyd in Minnesota and racism. Poughkeepsie JournalCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORECorrection: The reporter incorrectly stated the location of Tuesday's protest.Carlos Russell said he was jumped walking home from football practice in Brooklyn 39 years ago.A 13-year-old at the time, Russell said the group of men who attacked him were white.But, he said "the irony of the story," was that he was saved by a woman who was also white, and happened to be the wife of the captain of his area's police department."She came off her porch and stopped them from killing me," Russell said. "There are good people out there. There is a balance, there is a common understanding, but there is a group of people that are just totally about hatred and the enemy and anger, we need to stomp it out." The New Paltz resident said he is angry he has to continue the same fight his parents fought in the 1940s and 50s.Opinion: George Floyd's death shows 'someday' has not come for black AmericaCuomo directs AG's Office to review actions during Brooklyn protests of George Floyd death'I'm done dying': Peekskill rally on George Floyd's death calls for actionRussell was one of hundreds to march the streets of New Paltz, protesting the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis after a police officer detained him and knelt on his neck.

The video of Floyd's death brought Russell to tears. He said it is proof that not much has changed since he was a boy. "It (has reached) a point where it (is) too much. How many more times, how many more people have to be buried, how many more people have to be killed?" Russell said. "At what point do we take this more seriously than what we've gotten?" Protesters came from throughout the Hudson Valley to march past the local police department and up Main Street. The crowd was filled with faces of all different races and ages, holding signs, honking horns and chanting. Nearly every protester wore a mask, and organizers guided the crowd following safety guidelines for social distancing.

"You matter, I matter, we matter," she shouted. The 26-year-old Newburgh resident attended Saturday's protest to fight against racism across the nation, and support the black movement. Green said she was "disgusted" by Floyd's death. As a daughter of a retired police officer, she said she expects officers to make the same choices her father made for 20 years."I know that my father would never do that. My godfather would never do that... I know that it doesn't have to be that way, they have to choose better," Green said.Tyla Green, of Newburgh, is brought to tears by the support of hundreds from all races and ages pic.twitter.com/KUT2J6wAiM— Katelyn Cordero (@KatelynCordero) May 30, 2020Both Green and Russell said they felt a deep sense of anger surrounding Floyd's death, but were moved by the diverse outpouring of support from the community."To see all the other people that are here to support, all these honks, and beeps, all these signs that makes me happy to know the world does see this. We just have to change it, we have to be stronger," Green said.She made note of a white man driving by with a fist in the air, honking his horn. "I love this.

"There will be change, I just hope we're here to see it." 'About not being silent'Many in the crowd said while they cannot understand the struggles of black Americans, they felt Floyd's death was a breaking point.Fallyn Ruzzi, 31, of Catskill, said she has been crying "rage tears" for days, and felt protesting was her opportunity to help. "I just want to be an ally... I will never understand the pain they go through, but I want to be there to try to stop it," Ruzzi said.Conor Urian and Kyle Miller, both of New Paltz, said the "chilling" and "brutal" murder of Floyd was something they could not let go by.As white men, "It's really about not being silent," Urian said. "someone said to me that silence is white supremacy, and it hit a chord with me that I am very privileged not to have to feel threatened all the time. It's time to raise that awareness." Multiple events in the mid-Hudson Valley have been planned in protest of racism and police violence. A Vigil in memory of Floyd with be held at Changepoint Church in Poughkeepsie on Sunday night. A "We Can't Breathe" protest is planned for Tuesday at Harriet Tubman Park. A "Walk For Black Lives" is planned for Tuesday in Kingston, as well.
