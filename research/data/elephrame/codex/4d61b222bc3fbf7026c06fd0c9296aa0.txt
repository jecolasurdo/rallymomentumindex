Hundreds of people gathered for a demonstration in Balboa Park on Monday for the seventh day of nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody and while the protest did descend into an "unlawful assembly" by some at night, it remained mostly calm during the day. Protesters gathered to express outrage over the black man's death in the custody of a white police officer while three other officers were present. Former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin was charged with 3rd-degree murder and 2nd-degree manslaughter but the other officers have not been charged. #Happeningnow Peaceful protest in Balboa Park nearly 200 people We're live #NBC7 pic.twitter.com/8PnYhj8RUr— Dave Summers (@DaveSummersNBC7) June 1, 2020 The San Diego Police Department has said it will facilitate peaceful protests to ensure people remain safe.

Officers declared an "unlawful assembly order" and unleashed tear gas, pepper balls and flashbangs at those that refused to disperse. As the evening progressed, some of the demonstrators turned to violence, smashing in windows of businesses in the area surrounding Horton Plaza and looting stores like a CVS Pharmacy. San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer acknowledged on Monday that the majority of the group remained peaceful. "95% of the demonstrators were peaceful last night in San Diego. The very small percentage of those who engaged in violence, they are doing a huge disservice to those that are out there peacefully demonstrating," Faulconer said. A crowd of sit-down protesters gathered for a demonstration in Balboa Park on Monday for the seventh day of nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody, reports NBC 7's Dave Summers. SDPD said by the end of the night, 97 people were arrested on charges from failure to disperse to burglary, assaulting officers and vandalism. About a quarter of them were not from the San Diego area, Chief David Nisleit said at a Monday press briefing. "There are people that will come to this town with the sole goal of anarchy. And that's destruction, that's damage, it's violence toward people, it's violence toward law enforcement, and it's just a full disregard for everything else," Nisleit said. "They don't care about looting, they don't care about setting things on fire. In fact, that's their goal." This isn't our first rodeo, and we are doing our very, very best and that's our commitment." A group of local community members condemned the actions of the police department at Sunday's protest arguing that the department agitated the crowd with a military-like presence which could have led to more unrest.
