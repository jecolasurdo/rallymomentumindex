They marched down Fourth Street and turned onto Market Street, where they chanted at restaurant-goers, sat in the middle of an intersection near Rodney Square, formed a human chain in front of the Citizens Bank Center and blocked the road in front of the mayor's office.City police rerouted traffic around the intersections where the protesters marched. Bystanders pulled out cellphones to capture the scene on camera."If there is no justice, there will be no peace, and I mean that," said Jeremy McDole's sister, Keandra. "I'm coming after all their businesses. I'm going to hit them where it hurts, and that is their pockets."The McDole family has called for the resignation of top city and state officials, including Delaware Attorney General Matt Denn, Wilmington Mayor Dennis Williams and police Chief Bobby Cummings, since the September shooting.McDole, 28, who used a wheelchair, was shot by four police officers on Sept. 23 after police received a call that an armed man with a self-inflicted gunshot wound was in the 1800 block of Tulip St. near Lancaster Avenue.Police have said investigators found a .38-caliber gun at McDole's side, but the McDole family has accused police of planting the gun as evidence.Much of the public information about the shooting has come from a bystander's cellphone video that shows an officer pointing a shotgun at McDole screaming at him to "drop the gun.” Other officers are later heard screaming, "Hands up.” When McDole did not comply and reached to his waistband, police said the four officers fired on him.The shooting is being investigated by the Wilmington Police Department and the state Department of Justice Office of Civil Rights and Public Trust, which is standard after a police shooting. The city police department's investigation is to determine if any procedures and policies have been breached, while the state investigation would determine if the officers broke any laws.Keandra McDole said that police and Attorney General's Office have provided her family with no details, including the names of the police officers involved and a time frame for the completion of the investigations."We have gotten nothing," she said. "No names, no information on any investigation or anything going on."Baltimore civil rights lawyer William "Billy" Murphy Jr., who is representing the McDole family, said at the protest the family wants a full and thorough investigation, but they also deserve answers. The family plans to file a civil lawsuit in the future, he said.Murphy won a $6.9 million settlement last year for the family of Freddie Gray, who died while in the custody of Baltimore police."The family has a right to know what is going on," Murphy said. "The family needs to know what the progress of this investigation is, a timetable, and so far none has been forthcoming."Denn declined to say Monday when the investigation would be concluded or a report released. He also did not respond to previous calls from the McDole family for his resignation."I think it is probably best that I don't talk about the case," Denn said.The family has held several other press conferences and protests, including one in December where they marched on Fourth Street and another in October when they gathered under I-95.Family members said they would continue to protest until they got answers. Although no specific dates have been set, they plan to hold sit-ins, silent protests and march in the streets in the coming months."We are not going to be quiet," Jeremy McDole's mother, Phyllis, said.Monday's protest was peaceful, but briefly grew tense during one interaction in front of the mayor's office.A black Chevrolet Tahoe attempted to drive through the crowd of protesters in the street. When the Tahoe's side mirror collided with a protester, the driver got out of the vehicle and yelled, "I'm not the mayor."The protesters circled around him, but he then retreated to the Tahoe and was able to pull through the crowd to park near the mayor's office.Much of the protest centered on the city's business district, where workers, bundled up in the frigid weather, went about buying lunch. In front of one restaurant, the protesters chanted through a glass window at those eating inside.The Rev. Lawrence Livingston of the Mother African Union Church in Wilmington said the shooting of McDole, who was black, shows ongoing racism is occurring both in Wilmington and around the nation."This kind of thing doesn't happen in white communities," he said. "Yet we continue seeing it happen in our communities, the African-American communities."News Journal reporter Jenna Pizzi contributed to this story.Contact Jessica Masulli Reyes at (302) 324-2777, jmreyes@delawareonline.com or Twitter @jessicamasulli.McDole family hires prominent lawyerMcDole family calls for resignation of Denn, WilliamsStaff Directory Corrections Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Public Notices Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My AccountSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJob Network Cars.com Wilmington Homes Classifieds Education 10Best Reviewed Moonlighting Reach Local© 2020 www.delawareonline.com.
