Second St. in downtown Pittsburg. It is open to the public. Black Student Association President D'Andrè Phillips and Assistant Director of Student Diversity Programs Emely Flores said the rally will be a peaceful way to make voices heard and bring the community of Pittsburg together in solidarity. "We encourage people of all ages and backgrounds to attend and show that they will not stand for these racial injustices within our community or elsewhere,” Phillips said. The organizers cited these examples of senseless tragedies for the Black/African American community in recent months: On Feb. 23, Ahmaud Arbery was murdered while running in his neighborhood in Brunswick, Georgia. On March 13, Breonna Taylor was fatally shot by the Louisville, Kentucky, Metro Police Department. On May 11, in Oklahoma City, Travis Miller, a delivery driver, was blocked from leaving a gated neighborhood by two members of the homeowner's association. On May 25, while bird watching in New York City's Central Park, Christian Cooper experienced a disturbing confrontation during which a woman called the police on him after he asked her to leash her dog where it was required by law. On that same day, George Floyd lost his life after a Minneapolis police officer detained him by pressing his knee into his neck. In his last moments of life, Floyd cried out, "I can't breathe,” and also "Mama, Mama, I'm through,” as he took his last breath. The rally will include speakers PSU Director of Student Diversity Deatrea Rose, PSU Director of University Police Stu Hite, and others from the community. "Please join us as we stand with those spreading awareness and giving their all to achieve racial justice and equality for all," Rose said.
