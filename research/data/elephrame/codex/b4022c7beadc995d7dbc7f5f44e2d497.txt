Swanson removed his riot gear, going against almost all of his training, and approached one of the leaders of the movement."And I said, 'What else do I need to do?' and he said, 'Walk with us.' The best moment of my police career is when I said, 'Let's walk.' And we walked over a mile back to where it started and I could feel an instantaneous peace on both sides," Swanson said. "That would not have happened if they had not wanted to listen to what I had to say as well, so it is mutually agreed upon that I need to hear what they are saying."Amazing scene unfolding in Flint, Twp, Michigan.

(Photo: Ryan Garza, Detroit Free Press)Swanson said going into a hostile crowd with no gear and no indication of how he was going to be received went against tactical training and was fear inducing. Yet it was a step that needed to be taken.Now, Swanson is calling on other officers and agencies nationwide to do the same."Police leadership needs to take action on breaking down the first barrier," he said. "Police leadership, if they're not doing it already, come from behind your podiums, come from outside the conference rooms and the incident command centers, talk to the people. That is the difference. People that have something to say when nobody listens continues to be enraged and we are not going to fix the divide overnight, but you can see what happened instantaneously."Meredith Spelbring is a news intern with the Detroit Free Press.
