At one point, officers in gas masks fired tear gas to chase away protesters who were blocking an intersection by lying in the street, said Larry Flowers, a police spokesman.Mayor Shane McFarland enacted a 6:30 p.m. curfew to quell protests, but police struggled to enforce it. Gov. Bill Lee described the events in Murfreesboro as peaceful demonstrations that "escalated to overt threats to public safety and property.”All quiet now.

Mai and her daughter stopped by a nearby corner market to buy milk to ease the sting of the tear gas."They hit my van twice,” Mai said of police. "It busted by her window, and it went straight in.”More from #Murfreesboro. MPD took one person to the ground.

Andrew Oppmann, an MTSU spokesman, said there was no damage to the school."Everyone displayed the True Blue spirit that we strive for. The events that have happened are painful, but everyone was calm and peaceful as they conveyed their emotions,” Oppmann said.In downtown Murfreesboro, the meeting between police and protesters was not so amicable. A line of cops, some on horseback, advanced on protesters while threatening mass arrests for violating curfew. Crowds responded by screaming insults and curse words. At one point, officers could be seen tackling a young man of color as the crowd shouted and cars blared their horns in protest.Tempers flared, but the cops ultimately drove the protesters away by about 8:30 p.m., emptying the streets of downtown Murfreesboro.

(Photo: HELEN COMER/DNJ)The protests in Murfreesboro occurred alongside similar events in cities across the nation, many of which turned to riots and violence. Protests have been spurred by the death of George Floyd, a black man in Minneapolis who died as a police officer pinned him to the ground with a knee on the back of his neck. The killing inflamed long simmering fury over the deaths of people of color at the hands of police. On Saturday, a peaceful rally in Nashville descended into the violence and vandalism, culminating in a small group of rioters lighting a fire inside City Hall.The protests in Murfreesboro began with a peaceful vigil in Public Square intended to honor Floyd's memory. The event initially drew just 100 people, but quickly grew to fill the square."Our community has come together in ways I never imagined to stand in solidarity against injustice and overstep of police power," said Mike McDougal, the vigil organizer, during the event. "We must keep this movement growing.”Crowd downtown is in silence for 8 m 46 seconds in memory of how long it took George Floyd to die pic.twitter.com/ZeORfXoG80— Nancy DeGennaro (@NanDeGennaro) May 31, 2020Buy PhotoJonathan Dodson works to board up a downtown business on Sunday, May 31, 2020, before a vigil for George Floyd later in the day.
