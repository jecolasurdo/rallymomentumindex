Here is his full statement:"I organized the Penn Square peaceful protest that will be happening today. I saw that there was a brief article written about both protests going on today. I just wanted to ensure that there is a common understanding it is a peaceful protest and in all of our power we will try to keep it that way. We all love our city and everyone in it so much which is why we'll be marching AND remaining peaceful. I just wanted to clear the air."

Chestnut St., according to a Facebook post.Organizers of the planned peaceful protest wrote they call on those who have "had enough of systematic oppression and racism towards black people” to attend the event to show solidarity.A separate, in-vehicle protest by the activist group Lancaster Stands Up will take place on Sunday, May 31 at 2 p.m., according to an event posted on the group's Facebook page. A starting point and route for the vehicle protest was not yet announced Friday night.As of Friday evening, more than 70 individuals planned to attend the Saturday protest while 60 people had committed to attending the Sunday vehicle protest.
