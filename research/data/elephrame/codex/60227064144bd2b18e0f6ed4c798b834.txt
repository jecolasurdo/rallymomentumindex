She and other like-minded students don't agree with the stance taken by Students for the Second Amendment or Pavlich, she said, and they wanted to make sure that their views were reflected on campus.That dialogue – one group of students bringing in a speaker in whom they believe and another group of students respectfully voicing their opposition – is part of what the university tried to foster, said Jose-Luis Riera, UD's dean of students.Looking out on the small crowd gathered on the Green in front of Mitchell Hall before the speech started, Riera said, "This is what should be happening on campus.”Contact Saranac Hale Spencer at (302) 324-2909,sspencer@delawareonline.com or on Twitter @SSpencerTNJ.Staff Directory Corrections Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Public Notices Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My AccountSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJob Network Cars.com Wilmington Homes Classifieds Education 10Best Reviewed Moonlighting Reach Local© 2020 www.delawareonline.com.
