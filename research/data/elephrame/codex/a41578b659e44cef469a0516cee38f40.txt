(WIAT) — The City of Birmingham and the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute have announced a rally for justice and peace to take place Sunday, May 31, 2020, from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. The rally will take place at the pavilion at Kelly Ingram Park. It is being coordinated by the Mayor's Office of Social Justice and Racial Equity and the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. During the current national protest concerning the death of George Floyd, Birmingham's history serves as a beacon to the nation on nonviolent protest to build the community and bring about positive change, rally organizers say. It was in Birmingham where local and national civil rights leaders coordinated a key nonviolent campaign in the civil rights movement as the nation witnessed police brutality and violence in the city in 1963. "Birmingham, the World is Watching” will provide a gathering at Kelly Ingram Park in the spirit of the 1963 nonviolent campaign for civil rights. Huge crowds at Kelly Ingram Park rally. @CBS_42 pic.twitter.com/lSMt9YBF2g— Malique (@MaliqueRankin) May 31, 2020 Mayor Randall L.
