(Warning: contains profanity) A group of protesters decrying the shooting death of 40-year-old Aura Rosser temporarily shut down Monday night's Ann Arbor City Council meeting and twice prompted the council to go into recess.Roughly two dozen protesters were loudly chanting "black lives matter" and one protester was playing a hand drum as Mayor Christopher Taylor and fellow council members made the call to walk out of the room during the ruckus in an attempt to diffuse the situation.The disruption came during the meeting's opening public comment period after two of the protesters, Shirley Beckley and Anthony Morgan, spoke out about the Rosser shooting, arguing city police shouldn't have shot her.One city police officer was on hand in the room when the protest started shortly before 7:30 p.m. Within minutes, at least five officers were on hand, though they initially stood back and let the protest continue.Protesters sit quietly and hold up signs reading "black lives matter" during Monday night's Ann Arbor City Council meeting. Minutes later, they erupted into a loud protest with chanting and drumming.After city officials left the room to huddle in a side room, four of the protesters sat in the council members' seats and had their own meeting.Minutes later, some council members, including Sumi Kailasapathy, Sabra Briere, Stephen Kunselman, and Chuck Warpehoski, emerged from the side room and attempted to have a friendly dialogue with the protesters.Kailasapathy encouraged the protesters to share their concerns before the Human Rights Commission, which is looking into establishing a citizen oversight board for the Ann Arbor Police Department.Protesters interrupted and spoke loudly over some city officials and police officers who tried to have a dialogue with them.Protesters decried the lack of representation of the black community on City Council, calling the council a "farce" and arguing council members haven't taken a courageous stance since the shooting death of Rosser in November.Protesters sit in Ann Arbor City Council members' seats Monday night after taking over the council chambers.They also questioned the official position of the city and the police that Rosser was within 10 feet of officers and closing in on them with a knife when she was shot by Officer David Ried.The protesters called for an independent investigation into the shooting, saying the police can't investigate the police and they don't accept the Michigan State Police investigation into the shooting or the review by the Washtenaw County Prosecutor's Office that found the shooting was justified.Police let the protesters take over the room for several minutes before asking them to get out of council members' seats.Police told the protesters they were welcome to express their views, but they weren't allowed to disrupt the meeting or behave disorderly. Some protesters responded by saying they weren't going to listen and they needed to disrupt the meeting. They also vowed to return and disrupt future council meetings.City Attorney Stephen Postema told the protesters that the mayor had invited them to come to his open office hours, which are 8:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. on Fridays. After council members returned to their seats shortly before 8 p.m., Taylor tried to gain control of the room to resume the meeting, but protesters grew even louder and the drumming and chanting resumed, including chants about "racist police." The entire council then exited the room and called a recess for a second time.Most of the protesters were escorted out of the council chambers by police at about 8:14 p.m. They cried out that they were being threatened with arrest as they left.Council members returned to resume the meeting at about 8:16 p.m. and continued conducting city business without disruption at that point. Some of the protesters briefly returned to the meeting and sat quietly before leaving again.Taylor said free speech is important and protest has a long and honorable history in society, but he didn't think the way the protesters tried to communicate with the council Monday night was very constructive."When meetings of people of good will and earnest effort are disrupted, I believe it creates lines and inhibits conversation. It inhibits advancement," he said.Taylor said he still looks forward to meeting with any residents who want to talk about issues of equal treatment before the law."These are deeply important to residents of Ann Arbor, every resident of Ann Arbor, and they are also important to the Ann Arbor Police Department," he said.Kailasapathy responded to the concerns about minority representation in city government. She said minority groups are well represented on the Human Rights Commission, and she pointed out the chairman of the subcommittee that's looking into creating a citizen oversight board for city police is a black man.Warpehoski said racial disparities are real and he looks forward to continuing a constructive dialogue about how to address disparities in policing, education and other areas of society. He said there already are some good community conversations happening, and the city's police department is taking a close look at cultural diversity training that officers receive, with plans to do additional training this year.Ryan Stanton covers the city beat for The Ann Arbor News.
