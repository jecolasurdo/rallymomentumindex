The shirts, which were printed without notice to the W.N.B.A., read: #BlackLivesMatter and #Dallas5. The back of the shirts had another hashtag followed by a blank space."We do need people to stand up and understand and express that black lives are just as important as any other lives in America, and right now that's not being seen,” Liberty guard Tanisha Wright said.The coordinated effort was a rare spontaneous public stance on a social issue for a team in the W.N.B.A., which is in its 20th season. The Minnesota Lynx also wore similar warm-up shirts before their game Saturday night.Liberty forward Swin Cash, in her 15th season, said the players did not fear repercussions or fines from the league.After video surfaced of the shootings of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile last week, Liberty players began discussing ways to respond to the recent spate of shooting deaths involving the police, as well as the planned attack on police officers in Dallas.Recently, Knicks forward Carmelo Anthony posted a photo of civil rights leaders on Instagram and wrote a caption calling for athletes to effect social change. On Saturday, after winning her 22nd Grand Slam title at Wimbledon, Serena Williams also discussed the recent shootings.In December 2014, shortly after a grand jury did not indict a New York police officer whose chokehold led to the death of Eric Garner, an unarmed black man, N.B.A. players struck a similar stance to that of the Liberty players.Knicks guard Derrick Rose, then with the Chicago Bulls, wore a T-shirt with the phrase "I Can't Breathe” and was followed by LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and members of the Nets. Most of the players focused on supporting Garner's family, and were not as directly engaged in relating their attire to the Black Lives Matter movement.After the game on Sunday, which the Liberty won, 75-65, Kiah Stokes, Tina Charles and Carolyn Swords joined Cash and Wright to answer questions about their statement."I think it's a shame that we keep seeing people that want to make this movement as something that's violent,” said Cash, who repeatedly hit the lectern with her fist and whose voice cracked while speaking. "Five cops gave their lives up trying to protect a peaceful movement. And in this country, I do believe that you can assemble peacefully and protest against injustice. So until the system transforms, we cannot sit here and act like there is not a problem here in America.”Liberty guard Shavonte Zellous added that she thought W.N.B.A. players were finally beginning to feel comfortable addressing social issues. Zellous, who is from Orlando, Fla., has written "LGBT” and "Orlando Strong” across her sneakers since 49 people were killed at an Orlando nightclub on June 12.On Friday, the W.N.B.A. released a statement with the N.B.A. offering condolences to families affected by the shootings in the three cities. The W.N.B.A. did not provide a follow-up statement about the Liberty's actions on Sunday.In the locker room after the news conference, Cash continued to talk about race relations. She recalled how her grandmother would tell her about her fears living during the civil rights era."It's like the boogeyman's come back out of the closet and those things that used to be are now being brought to the forefront once again, and that's what really scares me,” Cash said.She added: "Each person can do something, if not publicly, within your community. Your perception can change, how you view people, just, I don't know,” as her voice trailed off.AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite IndexSite Information Navigation© 2020 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpSubscriptions
