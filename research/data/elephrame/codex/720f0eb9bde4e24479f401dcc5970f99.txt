We must confront and address the systemic criminal justice and electoral failures immediately and with the upmost urgency as they continue to lead to the dehumanization, disenfranchisement and death of too many Georgians.As the legislative session starts back next Monday, the Georgia NAACP will use the Constitutional right to assembly to demand state legislators address our legislative demands and ensure criminal justice reform, repealing citizen's arrest, stopping voter suppression and ending police violence against our communities as well as stopping harmful anti-voting rights bill SB 463.We are done dying. It's going to take real effort on the part of every elected official in the Georgia General Assembly to do their part to protect every single Georgian and ensure that this becomes a state that such a disheartening reality is of no more.
