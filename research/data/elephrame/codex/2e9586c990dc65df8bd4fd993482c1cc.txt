He raised his right fist high. From that right knee, Antonio Cromartie, just minutes before the Indianapolis Colts hosted the San Diego Chargers on Sunday, protested during the national anthem.Cromartie was the first Colt to peacefully protest the anthem this season.He's the latest in a growing number of professional athletes who have followed the protest that San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick started Aug. 26. Before Sunday's game, two Chargers, Joe Barksdale and Chris Hairston, joined Cromartie. They sat on the bench during the national anthem.When Terence Crutcher, an unarmed 40-year-old black man, was killed last week in Tulsa by officer Betty Jo Shelby, a white woman, Cromartie began talking to family members about joining other athletes who protested the anthem. He then had conversations with his teammates. Finally, he prayed."God spoke in my heart that I wanted to take a knee,” said Cromartie, who made his decision Tuesday. "These past couple days, with everything that's been going on in Tulsa and Charlotte, I just felt it was my time to take a stand. I just felt it was important for players, for us to start taking a stand.”Cromartie, an 11-year veteran, said he will continue his stand throughout the season.Antonio Cromartie becomes first Colt to take a knee during national anthemBefore his decision, Cromartie spent time educating himself on the social issues involving race, justice and politics that have become a part of American sports. He referenced the civil rights group Black Lives Matters. He also mentioned how he plans to spend time and money to help build the Indianapolis community through his foundation."Everyone wants to say all lives matter, but until black lives start to matter, all lives don't matter,” he said. "That's what people need to start looking at. When you take a knee, you're talking about everything that goes on in this country.”Cromartie also mentioned the 708 people who have been killed by police this year – including 173 black people – according to a database by The Washington Post."When you start looking at the statistics of everything that's going on, you're trying to figure out why,” he said. "Is it being taught? Is that what we're allowing? Of course it's been going on longer, but there's video of it and it's still going on.”'Cromartie became angered when he compared Shelby, who has been charged with first-degree manslaughter, to a 20-year-old black man who was arrested during a Black Lives Matter protest earlier this summer.Indiana Fever player: Why I took a knee during national anthem"The police officer in Tulsa had a bond of $50,000,” Cromartie said. "Then you have the guy that was protesting in (Chicago) that had a $350,000 bond. How is that coherent with each other? That's not right. So you're going to give, I feel, a black young man a $350,000 bond and you're going to give a police officer a $50,000 bond that killed somebody that had no weapon and then you lie about it in your report and tell you everybody he wasn't cooperating, and when you watch the video it's something different.”'But Cromartie was quick to explain that his protest primarily was about social injustice, not the police."All cops are not bad,” he said. "You have some great cops. I have some cops in my family. I have people that have been in the military that are in my family. My grandfather was a Marine. We're fighting for those people.”Dwayne Allen too kneeled at the end of Sunday's anthem, although it was not in protest. Throughout his six-year career, Allen has kneeled at the end of the song for prayer. He prays for the city of Indianapolis, the players on both teams to be remain safe and healthy. But he added to his prayer Sunday when he went to a knee."Our country,” Allen said. "I wasn't doing it as a demonstration. It's something I do every game, but I did take more time today to pray for our country.”'Allen said he did not have a problem with Cromartie's protest."We support all of our players in peaceful protesting,” he said.Doyel: Entire Indiana Fever roster kneels for national anthemAllen and many other Colts were not aware of Cromartie's gesture until after the game when reports alerted them of his decision. Cromartie and other Colts, particularly those on defense, said they did have conversations last week about possibly protesting the anthem before Sunday's game.The Fever, in unison, helped spark those discussions. The entire team knelt for the national anthem before their opening playoff game Wednesday against the Phoenix Mercury, a first such occurrence since Kaepernick began his protest."I think what the Fever did was strong because it was everybody,” said Mike Adams, who declined to comment on Cromartie's protest. "They did it together.”The Fever protested without telling their coach, Stephanie White, prior to Wednesday's game. White told her players she was proud of them for creating more conversations about the issues and for exercising their right.Cromartie told coach Chuck Pagano of his plans before Sunday's game."They have the freedom to choose,” Pagano said of his players. "That's their choice.”For 10 minutes, Cromartie explained why he kneeled. He answered every question he was asked. He mentioned his six sons. He wants to be an example for his sons."At the end of the day, no matter how much money I make, no matter how much I do within the community, I'm still a black man,” Cromartie said. "It don't matter what I do, no matter where I stay, no matter what car I drive, at the end of the day, when they look at me, I'm still a black man. It's not just me standing up for myself, but it's standing up for my six sons (that are) growing up.”Cromartie realizes some fans will not appreciate or understand his protest. He has a response to those fans who say he should focus on football and not address the pain he feels when it comes to the social injustice he has researched and seen in videos the last few years."I'm a black man first,” he said. "At the end of the day, I'm going to speak my mind – as a black man.”Call IndyStar reporter Nate Taylor at (317) 444-6484.
