Additional road blocks were being planned as the march continued.Police alerted protesters not to lie down in the roadways due to the amount of heavy traffic in the area, letting the participants know that possible arrests would be made if the requests for safety were ignored.After leaders of the rally briefly huddled, they decided to adhere to the police officers' requests and to avoid arrest amid safety concerns.Lead organizers expected more than 60 people to participate in Saturday's protest, which was going on in conjunction with others being held around the country in the wake of deaths to Michael Brown and Eric Garner, both unarmed black men who died in separate incidents involving white police officers.A similar protest was held last weekend at Opry Mills mall, and two marches were held in downtown Nashville in recent weeks."It's specific to Nashville as well," lead organizer Joshua Crutchfield said of the local protests. "We think Nashville has its own problems with discrimination overall."The protest will be peaceful, Crutchfield said.The Mall at Green Hills has not been formally contacted by protesters."Should a situation arise that violates our code of conduct, we will assess any appropriate action (that) provides the best possible experience for all of our customers in the mall at that time," The Mall at Green Hills spokeswoman Jessica Roberts said.Reach Andy Humbles at 615-726-5939 and on Twitter @AndyHumbles.Staff Directory Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Public Notices Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Business Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My AccountSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers Archives RSS FeedsJob Network Cars Homes Classifieds Education Moonlighting Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2020 www.tennessean.com.
