"There's bigotry, not just on the streets,” he said, declining to give his name out of fear of retaliation by his co-workers.

She attended with her 25-year-old daughter, Erin. Ferguson, a Seattle native, said she was pleasantly surprised by the diverse crowd. "Black, white, Asian, gay, straight — everybody's here. It's really cool.” Of encountering racism in the city, she said, "Of course we're very liberal, but it's here. Now, it's more hidden, but it's also in your face.” The Seattle woman continued: "It's not cool for people who are racist to show it. They mask it, but it's alive and well. I have a feeling it's going to get worse, and I hate to say it.” Then, her daughter jumped in: "What's the difference between a Muslim registry and a Jewish registry back in the '40s? More people need to be outraged and more people need to see people outraged about it.” Update 3:15 p.m.: Some protesters have poured onto the sales floor of Zara, chanting and hoisting signs. #BLM protesters briefly pushed their way into Zara clothing store: "Black Lives Matter, not Black Friday" pic.twitter.com/nSw0EPzWZ7 — Sara Jean Green (@SJGTimes) November 25, 2016 #BLM north on the 4th, heading back toward Westlake.
