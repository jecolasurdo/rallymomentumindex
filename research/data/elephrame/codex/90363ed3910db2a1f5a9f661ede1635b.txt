Some also faulted the city's political leaders."Something's wrong in this city" said Denise Hunt, a nurse who wore a name tag commemorating Isaac Singletary, an 80-year-old man fatally shot by Jacksonville police in 2007.At the opposite end of the state, activists marched through the streets of midtown Miami and blocked a causeway to Miami Beach, the Associated Press reported.Other protests were repeated around the country.The AP said several hundred people blocked downtown streets in Providence, R.I., while hundreds of demonstrators marched Friday afternoon from Yale University's law school to the New Haven, Conn. courthouse.Steve Patterson: (904) 359-4263 Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you.
