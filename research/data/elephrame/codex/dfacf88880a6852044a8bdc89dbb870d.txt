His stepmother described him as a respectful young man and said he was the son of a Birmingham police officer.Police initially said an officer shot Bradford because he was seen "brandishing a handgun” while fleeing the scene. Authorities respond to the incident at Riverchase Galleria in Hoover, a suburb of Birmingham, on Thursday. Photograph: APIn a Friday news release, police captain Gregg Rector said new evidence suggested that while Bradford "may have been involved in some aspect of the altercation, he likely did not fire the rounds that injured the 18-year-old victim”.Rector said police now believed more than two individuals were involved in the altercation that started the shooting and a gunman was at large.Bradford's father, Emantic Bradford Sr, said on Saturday night that his son had a permit to carry a weapon for self-defense. He added that it was hurtful police portrayed his son as the shooter.The Bradford family wants to know if there is police body camera footage from the shooting. Hoover police have not confirmed if such footage exists.
