At Brown, the students -- some dressed in black in a show of support for black victims of racism -- along with some faculty and administrators, gathered on the green between University Hall and the Van Wickle Gates Thursday afternoon. After posing for a group photograph of the "Blackout," students of color took turns at a megaphone to speak out about their experiences as the victims of racist remarks and racial slurs, said Danielle Perelman,a Brown student who photographed the protest. One student spoke about finding a racial slur scrawled on her dorm room door, Perelman said. At Providence College, more than 100 students joined in a rally and march organized by the Providence College Chapter of the NAACP that began shortly before midnight at the Slavin Student Center. The event was to "support the struggle for representation and respect by students of color at the University of Missouri and other "PWI's," Primarily White Institutions, a statement from the group said. The protesters chanted "Racism has got to go!" and "Mess with us, we'll mess with you. We stand together with black Mizzou!” said Adriel Antoine, 18, a sophomore and vice-president of the PC-NAACP. The protesters then marched from the Slavin center through lower campus to Eaton Street, Antoine said, where they gathered at the home of PC's president, the Rev. Brian J. Shanley. One of the more powerful moments, he said, was when the protesters formed a circle outside his house and students took turns speaking with a megaphone. "People gave personal testimonials and vented about racism in general and the Black Lives Matter movement,” Antoine said. The Rev. Shanely and Kristine Goodwin, the college's vice president for student affairs, attended the protests, he said, and heard the testimonials. "We as Providence College students need to stand in solidarity with students at Mizzou and to [have] conversations about racism on campus so that we don't become a Mizzou," said ViDale Lovett, president of the PC-NAACP.
