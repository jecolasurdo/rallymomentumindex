WochitCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREEditor's note: This story was updated Saturday with new information from police on the reported shooting. What started as a peaceful protest against police brutality at Detroit Public Safety Headquarters on Friday afternoon turned into a series of violent clashes between police and protesters throughout downtown past midnight.A 21-year-old man from Eastpointe was also fatally shot by an unknown suspect in the area of Congress and Randolph, Detroit Police said. The circumstances surrounding the incident are still being investigated. At least 60 people were arrested in connection to the protests, according to Detroit Police. The majority of those arrested reside outside Detroit, within the metro Detroit area, police said.More: Police: Man killed in shooting near Detroit protests was 21-year-old Eastpointe manProtesters and police in riot gear began facing off near the Renaissance Center about 9:45 p.m.From that point on, the scene became tense and frequently violent for the next several hours as police tried to relocate protesters out of downtown.Protesters threw rocks and plastic and glass bottles toward police. In response, police charged toward protesters, threw punches and fired canisters of gas that got into people's eyes and airways."The more they do this, the more they're antagonizing people,” said 28-year-old Shawn Vaughn, after police used gas to get protesters to move from a parking lot.About 5:45 p.m., long before the clashes with police, the peaceful protest showed the first slight signs of taking a turn. Protesters could be seen circling a police vehicle waving middle fingers and shouting, "F--- the police," and police also arrested a man for unknown reasons in the area of Michigan Avenue and Rosa Parks Boulevard.Protesters prevented the police car with the arrested individuals from leaving, police responded on horseback to move them away and then some individuals could be seen pulling on the reins. Two damaged police cars with missing windows were also visible.Elsewhere at Woodward Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, no such interactions were visible. There were chants of "Whose streets? Our streets."A Facebook event for a march and rally showed at least 1,000 people were marked as attending at 4 p.m. in front of Detroit Public Safety Headquarters, 1301 Third St.By 3:50 p.m., a crowd of at least 100 people had already gathered and started to chant, "No justice, no peace, no racist police."

The gathering comes after the death of 46-year-old Floyd, a black man, who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest Monday in Minneapolis. A viral video showed Floyd saying, "I can't breathe” as passersby pleaded for police to stop.FacebookTwitterGoogle+LinkedInProtesters gather for Detroit rally, march against police brutality FullscreenPost to FacebookPosted!A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.

March for Black Women Detroit, Michigan Progressive Caucus and Detroit Anarchist Black Cross also organized the event."Police brutality is an unaccountable epidemic and its time people took a stand,” organizers said, according to the release.The group and marchers also pointed to injustices with water shutoffs, foreclosures and poverty. They called for the march to be nonviolent and for social distancing amid the novel coronavirus pandemic. Most attendees wore masks. Activist Siwatu-Salama Ra addresses the rally in Detroit. She went on to implore the crowd to "defund the police,” "abolish prisons” and "turn the (expletive) water on.” pic.twitter.com/rmIWmssn6o— Angie Jackson (@AngieJackson23) May 29, 2020Detroit City Council President Pro Tem Mary Sheffield led a chant of "I'm fed up,” shortly after the rally began."The way in which this country values black lives is unacceptable,” she said. "And to be honest with you, I'm tired. I'm tired of rallying. I'm tired of marching. I'm tired of asking ... We are demanding justice.”A rally against police brutality started early Friday afternoon in Detroit, following the death of George Floyd in Minnesota. (Photo: Junfu Han, Detroit Free Press)One attendee, Katherine Mitchell, 19, of Detroit, held a small cardboard sign that read "Black lives matter” and "Stop killing us.”The video of Floyd's death left her feeling numb and distraught, she said. She attended Friday's rally to express that she's sick of seeing black people dying at the hands of police. "I'm hoping it really opens up people's eyes to let them know that we just want justice. We want them to stop killing us,” Mitchell said. "We deserve just as many rights to live in this country as freely as anybody else.”The swelling crowd moved into the headquarters' parking lot after a brief time on the street, but at about 4:40 p.m. was marching down West Lafayette Boulevard by the federal courthouse toward Campus Martius.The group was headed north on Woodward Avenue near the Fox Theatre minutes later and by about 5:15 p.m. were blocking Michigan Avenue near the Rosa Parks Transit Center, with hands up yelling, "Don't shoot." While marchers moved around the city, speakers also continued to address a crowd in the police parking lot. About 5:20 p.m. the group of marchers returned near the police headquarters, gained many who had stayed to rally, and set off toward Corktown. The event was set to end at 5:30 p.m. but by 6 p.m. crowds were visible along Woodward Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard and in the area of Michigan Avenue and Rosa Parks Boulevard, where the several skirmishes had broken out. At one point, protesters could be seen throwing bottles and kicking at a police car, which then sported a punctured window. Protesters also surrounded the vehicle, while other protesters urged them to let the vehicle pass. It eventually moved. One person grabbed and threw a police officer's cap. Another protester returned it. A police captain holding a gas mask could be seen reaching into a pouch for a canister, and people started saying he was getting tear gas. None was used at that point. It has gotten a little our of control here. DPD brought in the horses to remove people from surrounding the car. The officers are yelling "get” to protesters and the they are responding by pulling the harnesses of the horse. Car still hasn't moved. Wild scene. pic.twitter.com/MM95BHTSGY— Branden Hunter (@JustCallmeBHunt) May 29, 2020By 7:20, the crowds were located in several spots of the city. By 8 p.m. protesters were calling for more marching Friday night as well as Saturday. They chanted "black power" after making the decision. Later, protesters were seen yelling in the faces of some officers and a police car had been vandalized with spray paint.The first true clash with police occurred about 9:45 p.m.Not long after, during a Facebook Live at 10:22 p.m., Chief James Craig said nine people had arrested, six men and three women. Seven of them were residents from outside Detroit. Officers were attacked, he said. A command officer was struck with a rock and taken to a local hospital. Another officer on a bike was struck."I will not stand by and let a small minority, criminals, come in here, attack our officers and make our community unsafe,” he said.That was before the police alterations continued, and a man was fatally shot.Police initially said a 19-year-old was killed when an unknown suspect fired shots into the crowd. On Saturday, they said a suspect walked up to a vehicle and fatally 21-year-old. By the end of the night, Detroit Police had made dozens of arrested, Detroit Police Sgt. Nicole Kirkwood said. An exact number was not immediately available as of 2 a.m. Sade Brown, 22, of Detroit said her twin sister, Shiann Brown, was one of the people arrested.They've been protesting all day and the protesting was peaceful until police started making the protesters back up, Sade Brown said.She said the sisters turned around to do so, and then police came upon them and were again pushing them to back up."They were just pushing us literally to the point where we fell,” she said, later adding: "They dragged her away, they literally dragged her by her legs.”They were following orders, she said.Julia Bradley, 21, of Southfield described a push-and-pull scenario with police and protesters."One of the cops, he said, 'You all are part of a group that are throwing rocks,' I said, 'Throwing rocks and actually murdering people, those aren't comparative.'”She had not seen rocks thrown.Police could be seen retreating, protesters then going back up to them. After some sort of apparent confrontation, police were seen charging forward.Those gathered and marching earlier in the day included both white and black protesters, with attendees Lauren Wasiak, Kaleigh Kuhns and Maggie Kuhns arriving from Oakland County to show support.They held two signs that read "Black Lives Matter” and another that quoted activist and former Black Panther Angela Davis, reading: "In a racist society, it is not enough to be non-racist, we must be antiracist.” Another attendee Austin Dunsen, 31, said the "melting pot” of people who showed up to decry police brutality left him encouraged.Dunsen, a Detroit musician who goes by Apropos, held a sign that read, "Am I next?”"Being black in America, when I wake up every day and I see something like we saw with George Floyd, it only makes me think, 'That could be me,'” he said. "If I get pulled over and get thrown on the ground, will there be a knee in my neck?”Signs at the rally recalled other black lives taken, including Breonna Taylor, Auhmad Arbery, Trayvon Martin and Aiyana Stanley-Jones. Taylor was killed in March during a police raid on her home in Kentucky. Arbery was killed in February in Georgia after being pursued by white men, who were arrested this month after a video of the shooting went viral. Martin was fatally shot in February 2012 by a neighborhood watch captain in Florida. Stanley-Jones, a 7-year-old girl, was fatally shot during a Detroit police raid in 2010.Andrell Thomas 32, of Detroit, got stuck in his car at Michigan and Trumbull avenues on his way to Bucharest Grill, but said he was glad to see the protests.Black people have been trying to live in peace, but face police abusing their power, he said.CLOSE The gathering comes after the death of 46-year-old Floyd, a black man, who died after a white police officer knelt on his neck during an arrest Monday in Minneapolis. Wochit"I like that everybody is out here protesting but I think it's unfortunate how in 2020 black people are still facing a lot of the injustices that they're facing right now,” he said.He also joined in criticism of President Donald Trump's overnight Tweets.More: Trump says violent Minneapolis protests dishonor George Floyd's memory, Twitter labels 'shooting' tweet as 'glorifying violence'He Tweeted about 1 a.m. Friday about protests in Minneapolis, saying "when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”Thomas said it was disrespectful."It's adding to the fuel instead of trying to help with the problem,” he said.I'Sha Schultz-Spradlin, 27, of Detroit was burning sage with Dragon's blood incense early in the rally, saying it cleanses vibes and she hoped it would help keep the effort peaceful.But anger is warranted, she said. Messages about not murdering black people don't seem to be getting through.Asked about the Detroit police's relationship with the community, specifically, she said she had many thoughts. She offered this:"In the end of the day, it all comes down to the fact that police aren't even properly trained on how to go into communities. They got rid of neighborhood policing so as much as it is their fault, it's also just the system's fault as well.”Another attendee, Shanae Riser, said she told her daughters, ages 6 and 2, about Floyd's killing. When she said she would be protesting, the girls wanted to join. Riser's fiancé marched alongside her on Washington Avenue. Her 2-year-old daughter rode on his shoulders and held one small fist in the air. "As a family, it means everything,” Riser, of Detroit, said of marching in support of Floyd. "This is a part of their history.”Xavier Blevins, 22, of Northville called the gathering beautiful, with people of all colors present.Speaking before the evening face-off, he said things escalated when an officer vehicle escalated toward protesters. His foot was run over, he said.Kirkwood was not immediately aware of such an incident and was seeking more information. Blevins said even peaceful protests face tear gas, and also said they won't stand for a crooked judicial system."The 90% that are good are not stopping the 10% that are bad, so they're all bad,” he said of police.Detroit Police Chief James Craig called Floyd's death "murder” on Thursday, saying there was clear probable cause to arrest the officer.George Floyd died May 25 after a Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck. (Photo: Photo courtesy of the Floyd family)The officer who knelt on Floyd, Derek Chauvin, was charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter on Friday after days of fiery protests in the city.He and three officers from the scene were fired shortly after the death.Protests have erupted across the country.Here's a look at how events unfolded in the later hours of the protest.10 p.m.: Police and protesters clashed near the RiverWalk in Detroit. About 100 or more protesters were surrounded by police shortly before 10 p.m near the RiverWalk at Atwater and Bates streets. Police were blocking movement to streets other than Jefferson Avenue.Then police in riot gear appeared. Shortly after, protesters could be seen throwing items as police with shields moved forward, then altercations would erupt with protesters being tackled.
