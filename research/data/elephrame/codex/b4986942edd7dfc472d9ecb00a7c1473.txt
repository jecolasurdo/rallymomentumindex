Community members and organizers from Twin Cities Coalition for Justice 4 Jamar came together on Friday, February 26th, at the Hennepin County Government Center in downtown Minneapolis for the third consecutive week of #FreemanFridays. Unicorn Riot was there to cover the event live. Organizers spoke to assistants within Mike Freeman's office as he was out of the office once again with an injury. The focus was once again on the demand for no grand jury and the prosecution of the police officers, Mark Ringgenberg and Dustin Schwarze, who murdered Jamar Clark 'execution style'. Witness Dennis Cherry states that gunshot seemed to startle officers.

Witness Dennis Cherry states that he was "frightened” when the "gunshot went off” after watching police jostling Jamar to the ground, with one officer on his back. He spoke of the police's reactions of shock at their own actions: "It shocked the officer that was sitting on him [Jamar Clark] because he jumped up so fast, in disbelief of what just happened. He started talking to the other officer and they started looking down at the man on the ground.” – Witness Dennis Cherry Dennis wound down his statement by imploring Freeman to not use the grand jury process in the Jamar Clark case, stating, "since the year 2000, not a single officer who has killed someone has ever been indicted in the state of Minnesota.” He finished his statement by stating: "If you push for a grand jury, Mike Freeman, Jamar Clark's blood is on your hands.” – Witness Dennis Cherry Unicorn Riot's documented interviews of witnesses of Jamar Clark's murder have proved to be mostly identical.
