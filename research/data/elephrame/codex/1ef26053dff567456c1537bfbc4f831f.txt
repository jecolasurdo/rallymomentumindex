They walked around the intersection singing the protest song, "I Can't Breathe,” a reference to the words Eric Garner told a New York City police officer as he was being choked.Protestors also repeated the lines, "Eight lives, eight nights,” in between reading off names of black people who have been killed by police officers.The protest was organized by Jewish organizations as part of the movement #ChanukahAction.McCoy's mother, Yavilah McCoy, helped plan the event, and was on the bullhorn leading chants for most of the protest.Atarah said she and her mother worry about her brother walking home at night, even in Newton, and they're scared to call police for almost any matter.Dozens of Brookline police officers, including Police Chief Daniel O'Leary, were on scene during the protest.Whereas the Tuesday night march focused more on the recent deaths of black men Eric Garner and Michael Brown at the hands of police, the Sunday protest was aimed at local law enforcement and town officials.One sign at the Sunday rally read, "Brookline Selectmen Your Actions Are Violence.”Gerald Alston, a Brookline firefighter who filed a complaint against the town after a white superior officer left a racial slur on his voicemail, was at the Sunday rally.The white officer, Paul Pender, left Alston a voicemail in 2010 that ends with Pender saying an obscene word, followed by a racial slur. The town's investigation of Alston's claim concluded that Pender's insult was not intended for Alston, but rather, a driver on the road.Pender was found to have violated the code of conduct and was suspended without pay for a few days. He was promoted to captain last year.Mary-Helen Nsangou, who organized the Brookline March For Racial Justice protest on Sunday, said the gathering allowed people to come together and speak about their personal experiences with racism."It was wonderful to have so many people come out in support,” said Nsangou.She said what made the protest unique was that it was not just in response to the deaths of Brown and Garner, but about local issues in Brookline."One of the things I was happiest about was the commitment of people and the interest of people in making it about Brookline and not just about Ferguson, or just about other injustices we've seen,” she said. "It was really about using the opportunity to look at ourselves as a community and ask how could we do better to address racial justice issues.” Sign up for weekly e-mails Site ServicesSupport Local BusinessesMy ProfileWork for UsSubmit your newsArchivesAdsPay Your Ad BillMarket PlaceHomesClassifiedsCommunity BlogsBrookline TAB Blog © Gannett Co., Inc. 2020.
