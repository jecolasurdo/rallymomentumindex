Melvin Brown, who planned to ask Mayor Tom McNamara and the City Council to support his call for federal oversight. "We want somebody to come from outside and give a federal investigation. The community deserves that, the officer's family deserves that, the Patterson family deserves that."Rockford Police Department squad cars escorted the marchers from the church down Court Street south to State Street where they headed east toward City Hall.Marchers chanted loudly in the hallway as aldermen arrived for committee meetings and as the meetings began. Alderman Joseph Chiarelli, who chairs the Codes & Regulation Committee, warned protesters that the city would enforce rules against disrupting the meeting.The protesters seemed satisfied when Police Chief Dan O'Shea agreed to meet with and hear the concerns of Brown, marchers and residents at 2:30 p.m. Tuesday at Kingdom Authority Church, 518 N. Court St.A lack of video and confusion about what happened immediately after the Nov. 5 incident seemed to fuel some of the mistrust of police expressed by some of the marchers and members of Patterson's family.Cox had conducted a traffic stop on a white pickup truck driven by Patterson in the area of East State Street and Dawn Avenue. Patterson was driving without a license, and his pickup truck had expired plates belonging to another vehicle.What happened next is the subject of a continuing investigation..embed-container { position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; } .embed-container iframe, .embed-container object, .embed-container embed { position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; } Police believe Patterson and Cox scuffled. Cox somehow became entangled in Patterson's truck, and the officer was killed when the truck hit a tree blocks away from the initial stop. An autopsy determined that although Patterson was injured during the crash, he had died of a gunshot wound.But in the initial aftermath of the crash, Cox's weapon could not immediately be found leading to speculation that another suspect might have the officer's firearm. Rockford University students and staff were warned to stay inside while the grounds were searched. There were other statements made on social media that turned out not to be true.Later, although investigators won't say exactly where, Cox's weapon was found and they no longer believe there was a second person with Patterson in the truck.Changing information right after the crash and a lack of forthcoming information is in part why Angela Thurmond, who said she is Patterson's cousin, joined the march."I feel the police are hiding information regarding his death," Thurmond said.The U.S. Department of Justice has conducted investigations of departments after officer involved shootings or in-custody deaths to determine if there is a pattern of civil rights violations, including a 2014 investigation of police in Ferguson, Missouri. After the 2009 officer-involved shooting death of Mark Anthony Barmore sparked racially charged protests, mediators were dispatched to Rockford from the DOJ's Community Relations Service to help resolve the conflicts.Former aldermanic candidate John Tac Brantley marched, saying community representatives or civilian oversight should be made a permanent part of the task force to help assure residents that the investigation is fair.The mayor said families of the men killed in the incident both want answers. But McNamara said he favors allowing the task force, which is made up of detectives from departments outside Rockford in an effort to provide an objective investigation, to continue as is."I have faith in our Integrity Task Force," McNamara said. "It's built with members who have chosen to serve our public. I trust them, I think this investigation is led by (Rockford Park District Police Chief) Theo Glover who has a long-standing history in our community of being a high-character individual, is trustworthy and somebody of high integrity and I fully back his leadership."Jeff Kolkey: 815-987-1374; jkolkey@rrstar.com;@jeffkolkey Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you.
