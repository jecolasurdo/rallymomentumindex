"And, I can't control how people act. All I can do is say to people, 'Come out and make your voices heard, and remember we are here to be peaceful and make our voices heard.'"All I can do is ask for that."Wrightstone, 19, said the rally is slated to begin at noon.More: George Floyd case: Pa. police chiefs condemn officer's knee-on-neck method seen in viral videoA Central Dauphin High grad, who said he is studying social justice work at NYU, Wrightstone said he helped organize the event, along with Alexia Brown, Shafia Bhatti, Nikki Deng and Maya Corey, to give the black community in Harrisburg a voice in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis. Officer Derek Chauvin, who was filmed kneeling on Floyd's neck, was arrested Friday and charged with third-degree murder."We want to make sure we have the basic parts of protest,” Wrightstone said. "We'll have a moment of silence, and we'll have a PA system and a way for black voices to be heard. Our intentions are fully peaceful and positive. We don't want to incite violence. We just want to create that space for people to have their voices heard because we are all outraged.”Wrightstone said everyone is invited to participate."Just be there at noon,” he said. "We have people making signs and bringing signs. It's just a big gathering."We are standing in solidarity for the people in Minneapolis and how heartbreaking that is. We know it could easily happen here.”-- Follow Brian Linder on Twitter, @SportsByBLinderThanks for visiting PennLive. Quality local journalism has never been more important. We need your support.
