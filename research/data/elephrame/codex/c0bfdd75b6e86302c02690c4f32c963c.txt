The protest in Opera Square was peaceful as attendees expressed their frustrations with the police department. Oshkosh Police Chief Dean Smith and Captain Becky Kaiser, along with several other officers, attended the protest and community conversation. Attendees were vocal in describing what they believe is an unjust system that targets black people and other minorities. Organizers and attendees shared their experiences of racism and discrimination. The protest was meant to have the community meet with police officers to discuss issues, organizer Imani Ware said. "What can we do next after protesting," Ware said. Another organizer, Madalyn Claudia Thom, said the protest was meant to collect data about racism in the city and bring the findings to Oshkosh Common Council. The protesters walked down North Main Street and passed the Oshkosh Public Library before coming back to Opera Square. While marching the crowd chanted "black lives matter," "I can't breathe" and "no justice, no peace." CLOSE Protesters walk as part of the Black Lives Matter protest in Oshkosh. Oshkosh NorthwesternAttendees support uniting to combat racism "I just want everyone to know that united we stand, but divided we will fall," said Ray Wright, an attendee from Black Lives Matter Oshkosh. "We will keep standing together, we will keep marching."The rally was intended to protest an unjust policing system that targets black people and other minorities, Wright said. "This is a protest, not a parade," Wright said. In a parade, people stay on the sidewalks. But ,in a protest people take to the streets, he said. The protesters have to stop cars to get their message across, Wright said. Wright also asked the crowd to help facilitate discussions between the protesters and the police. Brandon Williams, a local DJ who goes by the name DJ BWoop, encouraged people to get out and vote. President Donald Trump is fueling racists throughout the country – including mayors and governors, he said. "This is Trump's America," Williams said. Others spoke of uniting to combat a racist system. "It takes everyone to stop this," said Jacob Curry, another member of Black Lives Matter Oshkosh. It's going to take more than laws to stop racism, he said. If anyone sees a black person getting discriminated or harassed in public, they have to step in to combat that behavior, Curry said. "It's us vs. an unjust system," said Justin Waters, a Milwaukee resident who attended the protest. People need to wake up and unite to oppose and change the unjust system, he said. Protesters refer to Isaiah Tucker at rallyThe shooting of 28-year-old Isaiah Tucker, a black man shot to death by Oshkosh Police Officer Aaron Achterberg, came up during the protest. People asked Smith, the police chief, why Achtereberg is still employed at the department. Smith responded by saying that the Wisconsin Department of Justice, which conducted the investigation of the fatal shooting, cleared Achterberg, saying there was no policy violation. Winnebago County District Attorney Christian Gossett declined to file charges against the officer. A petition started by the organizers was circulated at the protest, asking the department to fire Achterberg and officer Kyle Roberts, who was also involved in the shooting of Tucker. Smith said there were 26 formal complaints filed against officers in 2019, with 20 coming from Smith and 6 from members of the community. People pressed the officers about how to make filing complaints easier for the communityAt one point, the protesters laid on the ground in solidarity with George Floyd, who died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more that 8 minutes. Thom said officers will walk with the protesters but they won't lay on the ground,Protesters also expressed frustration with Smith, saying he wasn't providing them with concrete answers about how the department could change.

He said he was there to support and listen to the community. Solidarity was the main theme of the protest. "I'm out here supporting Black Lives Matter because systemic racism exists in the United States," said Chris, an attendee who declined to give his full name. Chris, who is white, said he was there to show solidarity with the movement but said it should be centered around black people and their experiences."It's an event about black people and for black people about black lives mattering," he said. "I'm here as a body showing solidarity and support but not as a person trying to speak."Organizers say the protest was successfulThere are different views of how to handle policing and ethical conduct, but the protest and discussion were successful, Ware said. Ware appreciated that Smith showed up to listen. It shows he's compassionate enough to be willing to listen, she said. Williams agreed that the protest was successful, especially with how many people were willing to show up for the community discussion. Not all the cops seemed to be willing to listen, but those who showed up seemed to be engaged, he said. "We've got to get rid of these bad cops in our community," Williams said.Oshkosh Mayor Lori Palmeri also attended the protest, but did not speak. She was there to "actively listen" to the speakers about what they wanted to see changed. Palmeri said she will propose a resolution at Tuesday's council meeting to create a diversity and inclusion committee for the city. Smith posted a statement on the Oshkosh Police Department Facebook page on Wednesday morning regarding the killing of George Floyd. Smith said he was outraged by what had happened to Floyd. "When the video first surfaced in the media I immediately shared this video with all of our officers here in Oshkosh and specifically reminded them that this is not how we operate as a police department here in the city," Smith wrote in the post.Contact Lydia Slattery at 920-426-6710 or lslattery@gannett.com.
