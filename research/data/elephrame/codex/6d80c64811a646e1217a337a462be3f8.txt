George Armstrong Custer statue and later marched past the Monroe County Courthouse. Say their names. Which ones? Those words erupted throughout downtown Monroe Thursday, as more than 300 people gathered peacefully to protest the recent death of an African-American man who was killed after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for several minutes. But George Floyd's death was not the only reason demonstrators say they were protesting. It was in memory of several other African-American people who have been killed by police – Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Philando Castile, Breonna Taylor – a worldwide movement that's exploded from the heart of Minnesota throughout the nation and world. The violence must end now, said Tennery Hicks, 25, and Hayley Krieger, 21, both Monroe High School graduates and the organizers behind the recent protest in the City of Monroe. "Police brutality is a serious thing,” Krieger told The Monroe News from the Gen. George Armstrong Custer statue at W. Elm Ave. and N. Monroe St. "All 50 states are protesting because it's a serious issue. People are being murdered every day, and it's so wrong.” Hundreds gathered about 10 a.m. at the monument and later marched south on S. Monroe St., advancing left on E. Second St. past the Monroe Police Department. Demonstrators then traveled north on S. Macomb St., returning back on E. Elm to the Custer statue. Protesters remained at the monument for the majority of the day, planning another march about 3 p.m. Organizers applauded Monroe police Chief Charles McCormick IV for being supportive of the demonstration and blocking the roadways so protesters could march in the streets. "I lost track of the number of people thanking us,” McCormick said. "It's been a very good crowd. We've had zero issues.” Participants carried signs reading, "Black Lives Matter” and "White Silence is Violence,” among other phrases, while chanting for justice and peace in unity. The marchers were composed of largely local residents of varying ages and races. "It brought tears to my eyes, honestly,” Hicks said. "Honestly, I'm surprised there were so many people here. It was very powerful. It lets me know that if we needed to do something like this again, people would be here to support us.” On May 25, Floyd, a Minneapolis resident, reportedly was stopped by police because they believed he matched the description of a suspect in a forgery case at a grocery store. While Floyd was handcuffed and lying face down in a city street during his arrest, Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kept his knee on the right side of Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds – 2 minutes and 53 seconds of which occurred after he became unresponsive – according to a criminal complaint. Chauvin initially was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter on May 29. While those charges still stand, now he also must defend himself against a second-degree murder accusation added to the criminal complaint on Wednesday. The three other officers on the scene – Thomas Lane, J. Kueng and Tou Thao – also were charged Wednesday with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. All four officers were fired last week. Despite charges being filed, related protests and demonstrations, some turning to riots, remain to crop up throughout the country, as "Black Lives Matter” activists hope to draw attention to years-long conflict between African-American people and the police system, reports indicate. So far in Monroe County, there have been protests in the City of Monroe, Bedford Township and Carleton – with the most recent being Thursday at the Custer statue. All local protests have remained peaceful. "I felt like this is an important message for Monroe,” Hicks said. "We wanted to show that there were more people willing to show support than to disagree. "The main goal was to make this peaceful. People were worried that we would be looting or be violent, but it was always meant to be peaceful.” Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you.
