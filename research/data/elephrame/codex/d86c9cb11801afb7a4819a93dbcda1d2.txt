No representatives of the golf course interrupted the protest. The Trump National Golf Course noted that they were unable to comment on the event. After some 15 minutes of caroling, the protesters left the clubhouse and were met with Sheriff's deputies out on the driveway. A representative for the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department told LAist that he did not have any information on the action or the department's response. The source at the scene added that some legal representatives from the National Lawyers Guild may have been present as a few individuals with yellow NLG hats were spotted. The NLG was unable to be reached for confirmation.
