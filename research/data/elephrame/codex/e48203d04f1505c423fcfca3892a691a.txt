It is apparent that the lives of ALL Black people are under attack, however, the stories, experiences, and needs of Black women, girls, and femmes are left out all too often. And it is imperative that we work intentionally to bring them to the center. We must acknowledge the particular forms of violence experienced by our women, girls, and femmes. We must fight against the criminalization of Black victims of sexual violence, intimate partner violence, and abuse. We must resist the policing of Black gender expression, sexuality, and bodies. We must condemn the passage and defense of gender discriminatory legislation. We must break down the narrow standards of respectable Black womanhood and femininity deemed acceptable. We must #SayHerNameFrom New York City to Detroit to Durham, join us we take action nationwide on May 19th. Join us as we we we do this for #Rekia. Join us as we do this for #Mya.
