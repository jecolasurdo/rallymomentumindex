SoundThe gallery will resume insecondsAbout 75 people marched from downtown Riverside to the Riverside Plaza about 2 1/2 miles away during a Black Lives Matter rally on Sunday, July 10, 2016.Show Caption of ExpandBy Ali Tadayon | atadayon@scng.com | The Press-EnterpriseJuly 10, 2016 at 10:37 p.m.After days of rallies in the Inland Empire decrying perceived police brutality in the deaths of Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, protestors marched through Riverside on Sunday, July 10, urging an additional message — unity. Riverside residents Jeff Luckey, 22, and Anthony Curtis, 23, said that was the goal in organizing the march, which started at noon outside City Hall, continued with a march toward Riverside Plaza about 2 1/2 miles away and ended about 3 p.m. "Right now nobody's together,” Luckey said. "We don't want this to be a black thing or a white thing, we want to develop a solution.” The march came after a tumultous week in which Sterling and Castile — both black men — were shot to death by police officers in Louisiana and Minnesota, and five police officers in Dallas were killed during a protest against those shootings. About 75 people set off for the plaza about noon. Some held signs, and as they walked, many chanted, "Hands up, don't shoot,” a slogan that has become a rallying cry for those protesting police shootings of black men. Hennesy Brown, of Ontario, attended the march with her 1-year-old son King and her 9-month old son Angel. Brown chose to participate in the event to raise awareness in the community so that her sons won't share the fates of Sterling and Castile. "I don't want my sons to become a hashtag,” Brown said. As the protesters marched, they were met with honking car horns and cheers of support. By 2 p.m., the crowd at the plaza had grown to about 100. People were initially standing in the street in front of the movie theater, blocking traffic and forcing cars to turn around, but they moved when requested by police. The group assembled near the fountain in front of the theater, where speakers talked over megaphones. Subjects included former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's comments Sunday that the phrase "black lives matter” is "inherently racist”and the 1998 shooting of 19-year-old Tyisha Miller in Riverside. Unlike rallies Saturday in Eastvale and Moreno Valley, Sunday's was not organized by the local chapter of the Black Lives Matter movement. Brown, the Ontario mother, said she was pleased to see how many people of different races were marching. "I love the diversity, it shows that its not just black people who are affected,” Brown said. Abraham May, 19, was encouraged to see so many other Riverside residents rally behind a common cause. "I'm glad to see that Riverside does care about its people," May said. "The city has a lot of heart.” Newsroom Guidelines News Tips Contact Us Report an Error Get the latest news delivered daily!
