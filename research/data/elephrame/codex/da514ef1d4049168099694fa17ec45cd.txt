Earlier this month, 40-year-old Terence Crutcher was shot and killed by Tulsa Officer Betty Shelby after his car was stopped in the middle of a roadway. Officers at the scene say Crutcher was acting erratically and was not following commands. According to the affidavit, Shelby asked Crutcher if the vehicle was his and if it was disabled. "He was mumbling to himself and would not answer any of Officer Shelby's questions. Mr. Crutcher kept putting his hands in his pockets and Officer Shelby kept telling him to show his hands. At that point, Mr. Crutcher began walking towards the abandoned vehicle with his hands held up and was not responding to any of Officer Shelby's commands to stop,‚Äù the affidavit claims. In the dash cam video, you see Crutcher walking away from an officer and toward his vehicle with his hands up. Shortly after that, Crutcher was shot. He was pronounced dead at a nearby hospital. Last week, Tulsa County District Attorney Steve Kunzweiler charged Shelby with one count of first-degree manslaughter. On Tuesday afternoon, hundreds of people attended a prayer rally and walked through the streets in support of Crutcher and his family. The rally and protest remained peaceful, despite another protest that broke out nearby. A pair of anti-protesters held a bullhorn, yelling at the crowd that "Black Lives Matter is racist." Anti-protester yelling "Black Lives Matter is racist." "People see the opportunity. When they see the opportunity, they try to seize in that moment. We're here for a peaceful protest and it will remain that way," said Marq Lewis, with 'We The People Oklahoma.' Protesters in Tulsa A regional law enforcement group also held a rally to "show solidarity" for members of the Tulsa Police Department as the investigation continues into the shooting. A statement was sent by the group saying "First and foremost: Mr. Crutcher's death is a very sad tragedy. Our hearts truly go out to his family members as they mourn the loss of his life, and we pray that his soul is in Heaven.‚Äù Then the statement went on to say "Please understand: This is not about race, and it is not about our black citizens and our law-enforcement community being at odds with each other. This is also not about whether or not Mr. Crutcher's hands were in the air most of the time, whether or not he had a gun, whether or not there were drugs in his vehicle or his body, or whether or not Officer Shelby had a Taser or knew that another officer had one ready to use. This is about whether or not Officer Shelby believed that her safety or life was in danger when she shot Mr. Crutcher with her gun. That is the only issue because that is the standard for our law-enforcement community for using deadly force.‚Äù 36.153982-95.992775 Close Modal Suggest a Correction Your name(required) Your email(required) Report a typo or grammatical error(required) Submit Suggest a Correction Share this story Latest News Saucee Sicilian to be features on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives Local / 10 mins ago Two coaches test positive for COVID-19 at Edmond basketball facility Local / 55 mins ago Video 4 your garden: How to garden without hurting your back Local / 1 hour ago Video Campaign releases updates on Tulsa Trump rally tickets, requirements News / 27 mins ago Healthy teenager who took precautions died suddenly of COVID-19 News / 1 hour ago McDonald's hiring 260,000 people this summer News / 1 hour ago Video Deer Creek special education student gets hands-on job experience with OKC Energy Local / 1 hour ago Video Texas U.S. Senator introduces bill to make Juneteenth a federal holiday News / 2 hours ago Two new grant programs announced to help Oklahomans impacted by COVID-19 Local / 2 hours ago Two Oklahoma brothers fight to prove their innocence on Friday's 'Dateline NBC: The Long Road to Freedom' News / 2 hours ago Tuition, mandatory fees remain flat for most OSU campuses Local / 3 hours ago Mom thanks Amazon driver for fulfilling young son's 'additional instructions' on delivery News / 3 hours ago Video More News Top Stories Saucee Sicilian to be features on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives Two coaches test positive for COVID-19 at Edmond basketball facility Video 4 your garden: How to garden without hurting your back Video Campaign releases updates on Tulsa Trump rally tickets, requirements Healthy teenager who took precautions died suddenly of COVID-19 McDonald's hiring 260,000 people this summer Video Deer Creek special education student gets hands-on job experience with OKC Energy Video Texas U.S. Senator introduces bill to make Juneteenth a federal holiday Two new grant programs announced to help Oklahomans impacted by COVID-19 Two Oklahoma brothers fight to prove their innocence on Friday's 'Dateline NBC: The Long Road to Freedom' Tuition, mandatory fees remain flat for most OSU campuses Mom thanks Amazon driver for fulfilling young son's 'additional instructions' on delivery Video Read more stories More Stories Cruise lines to suspend sailing from U.S. ports until September 15 Stunning reversal: Navy upholds firing of aircraft carrier captain in virus outbreak Tulsa leaders reverse decision about downtown curfew ahead of Trump's rally Community raising $10 million to restore 'Black Wall Street' in historic Greenwood District Video Read more stories National News What to know about Juneteenth and why people are talking about it now National / 9 hours ago Defying the odds: Ohio man who doctors said wouldn't live past age 11 turns 62 National / 10 hours ago Video You have less than a month to file your taxes.
