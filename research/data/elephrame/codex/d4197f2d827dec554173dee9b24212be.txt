The protest began at Cochran and Sycamore, with demonstraters marching about two miles to Simi Valley City Hall. The protesters have been concentrated in a few different areas along the two-mile route, including at Tapo Canyon and Alamo. (Aaron Schrank/LAist) The protest was organised by high school students, and was met with controversy, including condemnation by local city councilman Mike Judge. On Monday Judge posted a meme of protesters on Facebook with this caption: "Wanna stop the riots? Mobilize the septic tank trucks, put a pressure cannon on 'em, and hose 'em down. The end." He later said the meme was a joke, according to CBS: "That's all I wanted to do, was make fun of the mask wearing but obviously people didn't take it that way. I don't think I did anything wrong, except maybe post a joke that was in bad taste." Simi Valley has a complicated history with racism in Southern California. In 1992, the trail for the police who beat-up Rodney King was moved from Los Angeles to Simi Valley, after claims that jury members in L.A. would be too biased. The four officers were found not guilty. There were no black-identifying members of the jury, which was made up of nine white members, one biracial, one Latino and one Asian. Jason Michael showed up to support the Black Lives Matter movement. He says anyone opposing it needs to understand that racism still exists in Simi Valley. "I mean I've had my fair share of racism being in this town in the eight, nine years that I've been here, so it's definitely prevelent," he said. "I mean, everybody knows about it. It's just everybody's quiet about it and this is a chance for everybody to show up and say that they're not quiet and, take a stance on something that's right." A small group of counter-protesters also made an appearance today. Erin Sanchez was one of them. "Every single person in America has their right to peacefully protest," she said.

The four officers on the scene have all been fired. The officer charged with Floyd's murder, Derek Chauvin, has a history of misconduct. He has now been charged with secondd-degree murder and manslaughter. The three other officers were charged this week with aiding and abetting Chauvin's actions.
