Our photographers and reporters were in the streets again to document what happened — here's a quick look at both the tense and touching moments that what went down in the Bluegrass State.Police didn't waste much time breaking up Sunday night's largest gathering.An estimated 1,000 protesters came together before 8 p.m. at Jefferson Square Park, at Sixth and Jefferson streets, which was also the site of the largest gathering on Thursday. They marched there after meeting at the Muhammad Ali Center and coursing through downtown, blocking traffic on Broadway at one point and chanting "Breonna Taylor" in front of Metro Corrections. Taylor, a 26-year-old African American ER tech, was unarmed when she was shot March 13 as police executed a "no-knock" search warrant at her Louisville apartment. The scene at Jefferson Square on sunday didn't last until the 9 p.m. curfew that Mayor Greg Fischer announced in the wake of violent protests and looting on Friday. Police rolled into the area and announced that they would be breaking up the demonstration because it was an "unlawful assembly." Minutes later, they shot flash bangs and tear gas into the crowd, scattering the protesters onto nearby streets.'We need to heal':Black Lives Matter holds 'Healing Ceremony' in downtown LouisvilleRead more:Breonna Taylor protesters question police tactics used prior to Louisville's curfew timeLouisville Metro Police Lt. Col. LaVita Chavous later defended the decision to break up the protest. Those in attendance did not have a permit, she said, and were blocking traffic. Chavous also blamed "anarchists" who had "infiltrated" the crowd with the intent of causing chaos.At a 10:45 p.m. press conference held by the mayor, Chavous also addressed claims that protesters were fired upon because they were carrying leaf blowers with bleach to shoot at police.Leaf blowers, Chavous said, can be used to "blow back chemicals into police's faces or blow back the gas, chemicals that we may use in an effort so that they can continue to be out there protesting and causing problems." At least two leaf blowers were seen in the crowd she said."We assume that they weren't going to blow leaves, and so we assume that those leaf blowers were for something to hurt us," she said.Chavous also called out those who had brought umbrellas, which she said "can be used as weapons."Louisville Metro Councilman Bill Hollander called for an investigation into the tactics police used over the weekend.On Saturday, police were seen on video destroying water bottles and milk gallons that belonged to protesters. Fischer said demonstrators had brought "mason jars full of flammable material" along with the other liquids. A police officer also was caught on camera Friday aiming and firing pepper balls at a WAVE 3 reporter and camera operator. (Chavous on Sunday said that officer had been identified and reassigned pending an investigation.)You can't tell people they're allowed to protest peacefully, Hollander said in a Twitter post, and then "after the fact, say we can gas you anytime if you don't have a permit. The public deserves an investigation & report-from an independent oversight system it can trust."Still, despite some heavy headlines, there were moments of compassion amid the disarray.A 38-second video shared by VICE News reporter Roberto Ferdman on Twitter made the rounds, showing a presumed protester hugging an officer in SWAT gear. An NBC News photo of a protester giving a fist bump to an officer on a horse in Louisville went viral as well. And at a protest in Lexington, officers at one point knelt with demonstrators in a show of solidarity that attracted national attention.On Monday, Fischer called for a "day of reflection."He said he would host a Facebook Live video at 11:30 a.m. with faith leaders from across the region. One of the purposes of the call, he said, will be to mourn those who have died in the coronavirus pandemic — "that's one of my worries about all these people being together," Fischer added.A decision on whether to institute another curfew, he said, would come later in the day.Lucas Aulbach can be reached at laulbach@courier-journal.com, 502-582-4649 or on Twitter @LucasAulbach.
