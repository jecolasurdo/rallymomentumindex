An attendee began chanting "Fire Pantaleo!” while de Blasio was speaking.

Garner died at the hands of the officer, sparking national outrage.Multiple people joined in the chant while Booker was speaking. The outcry caused a moment of silence among the candidates. Neither candidates, nor moderators addressed the situation aside from Booker pausing.To the protestors in the audience today: I heard you. I saw you. I thank you.This is what democracy looks like and no one said it was pretty. #DemDebate— Bill de Blasio (@BilldeBlasio) August 1, 2019At least two men and one woman were moved from the theater for the disruption, according to audience member Elizabeth Washington.About an hour into the debate more people were removed from the 5,000-person audience for chanting "3 million deportations," and holding up flags while Biden was speaking.CLOSE Ofelia talks about yelling out "3 million deportations" during the presidential debate in Detroit to bring attention to immigration policies. The Detroit NewsBiden's people tweeted a response while he was on stage. Trump's immigration policies are an assault on human dignity. We aren't a country that denies children soap and a toothbrush. This is not who we are. #DemDebate— Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) August 1, 2019The Detroit News caught up with some of the protesters outside. Rev. Kirsten John Foy said they decided to express their views about Mayor de Blasio's "lack of leadership, for his failure to fire Daniel Pantaleo, the killer of Eric Garner.""He wants to get up and proclaim himself to be a progressive, well show us your progressive credentials," Foy said. "Don't sit there and say you want to create a more equitable society for everyone, while back at home you're allowing police officers to kill without any recourse or accountability."Other protesters removed were Linda Sarsour, Mysonne Linen and Tamika Mallory."Then minutes later after multiple candidates spoke, a police officer came over and showed us his cuffs and said if we didn't leave we'd be arrested," Mallory tweeted. "...We did not interrupt Cory Booker, it was the Detroit Police Department that interrupted Booker and the debate to intimidate peaceful protesters for standing up for the dignity of Black life that had already completed protest minutes ago."Washington said she was sitting to the left of the theater when she saw the incident unfold rows in front of her."Everyone got quiet and the candidates carried on anyways," the Dearborn resident said. "Five security men rushed up to them, and people in the crowd were taking pictures. After the first man shouted, a lot of people looked nervous. But once they were escorted out, "the crowd was paying more attention to them not the candidates," she said.Detroit News staff writer Payne Lubbers contributed.srahal@detroitnews.com Twitter: @SarahRahal_CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/07/31/man-removed-during-democratic-debate-detroit-leading-chant/1885063001/Find JobsShare your feedback to help improve our site experience!
