He will be entombed next to his mother at Houston Memorial Gardens on Cullen Boulevard south of Beltway 8. The entombment, like the funeral, are private for the family. Cullen Boulevard in front of Houston Memorial Gardens will be closed to traffic, but pedestrians will be allowed in the area along Cullen on the sidewalks for those wishing to pay their respects. Pearland police anticipate heavy traffic in the area, so if you typically take Cullen Boulevard, you'll want to consider alternate routes. Floyd'd body is expected to arrive at the cemetery at sometime around 1 p.m., though that's just an estimate. Floyd will travel the last mile of the funeral procession in a horse drawn carriage.
