On Saturday, dozens of protesters came together in Tampa and in Lake Eola to demonstrate against police brutality. The gatherings are two of the protests springing up around the United States in response to the recent events in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb where tensions have flared in the week since 18-year-old Mike Brown was shot and killed by a police officer. Gov. Jay Nixon has since declared a state of emergency in Ferguson and has imposed a curfew. On Saturday afternoon, several people stood outside of one of the Tampa Police Department's substations in a show of solidarity. While it was a much smaller crowed than the one in Ferguson, the message was the same. "We are demanding a change in the way our communities have been policed," protester Connie Burton said. Those who attended the demonstration said they hope to put an end to police violence, including shootings like the one that left Brown dead. "I have five brothers myself and it could be one of them any day,” protester LaShawnda Smith said. Protesters weren't just standing against what happened to Mike Brown, but against the heavily armed police during the latest Ferguson protests. "We don't want a police department that stand up like a military army against its people,” said Burton. In downtown Orlando, at Lake Eola Park, another rally was held to show solidarity with Ferguson in light of the Michael Brown incident. A small group of demonstrators made their voices heard at downtown Orlando's Lake Eola Park, chanting, "Hands up! Don't Shoot,” during their rally of solidarity with Ferguson, Missouri after unarmed teen Michael Brown was shot and killed by a police officer. Sheena Meade says they didn't know exactly what to do here, but they felt something had to be done. "I say, and I have four sons .... I have four black males that I'm raising. And, it could have been them. And, police brutality is everywhere around the nation,” said Meade. With a sign of peace worn by one of the demonstrators walking by, Meade says it doesn't matter that Brown allegedly robbed a convenience store before his death. She continues, "Is his life not still valued? He was a child who just got killed.” Police officers claim the teen was going after an officer's gun when he was shot, but witnesses have come forward saying Brown was trying to run away when it happened. Meade says the message in Saturday's organic movement is that lives should be valued and police brutality stopped, that the community needs to have a clear conversation with law enforcement to ensure nothing like this happens here, and that conversation should sound like this. "They should value the lives of our kids, our community and people. They're supposed to be servicing our communities. We should feel safe,” says Meade. Meade also stresses that parents need to have a conversation with their teens too. "Knowing their rights when they have engagement with the police officers. I believe that's something that we need to do better...talking to our youth about their rights when they get approached by a cop,” Meade added.
