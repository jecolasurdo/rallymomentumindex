Teammate Isaiah Gordon joined him on the ground, as well as Barringer assistant coaches Markyse Joseph and Buchie Ibeh. At least five more teammates put their knees in the turf, and a handful of spectators remained seated in the bleachers.PHOTOS: Barringer football players, coaches kneel during national anthemThe demonstration was the latest peaceful protest in response to a spate of police shootings of civilians across the nation. It was organized by Gordon and Ingram, a pair of seniors who said they've been kneeling for most of the season because of police violence, particularly against unarmed black men."We see how the cops are treating people and I don't stand for that, and I don't think the national anthem should stand for that,” Gordon said. "Until that changes, I'm not going to stand up. I'm going to keep kneeling.”Gordon and Ingram said they've kept their decision to kneel mostly quiet, only telling a few teammates and coaches. They said they've knelt not for attention, but because the issues matter to them personally. In fact, Barringer head coach Ron London and athletic director Terrence Brogdon said Friday night they were not even aware players and coaches had knelt on the sideline for the anthem."Everybody has their own decisions to make in certain things," London said after Barringer fell to Irvington by a score of 36-23. "I don't have any issue with that. If they took a knee, they took a knee for their own personal reasons."Gordon and Ingram said they're protesting now because police shootings of civilians has reached an unfathomable level. Earlier this week, Keith Scott, 43, was shot and killed by a police officer at a housing complex in Charlotte, sparking two days of violent street protests. And eight days ago, Terence Crutcher, 40, was shot to death by a police officer after his SUV stalled in a roadway in Tulsa, Okla.Crutcher and Scott are two of at least 707 people — 164 of them black men — who have been fatally shot by police officers this year, according to a Washington Post database tracking police shootings.When Gordon, who lives in Newark's South Ward, sees another story about a civilian shot by police, he said, "I feel like I'm next. I really don't want to go outside.RELATED: Wilson football players kneel during national anthem"I feel like everybody should be treated equally,” Gordon continued. "We shouldn't be killed because of our skin color. We're all trying to survive. We've got family. Everybody should have a fair shake.”Ingram, who lives in Newark's North Ward, added that kneeling helps show solidarity in their community."It shows a stand that we're together; that we're standing together through all the obstacles,” Ingram said. "We might not know each other, but we're brothers. We're all going through the same things. We're going to ride together."Several athletes at all levels of play have followed the lead of San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who sat for the national anthem several weeks ago to protest police brutality and oppression of black people.In New Jersey, Woodrow Wilson coach Preston Brown gained widespread attention when he knelt for the national anthem before the Tigers' home opener earlier this month to bring attention to social injustices and economic disparities. Most of Brown's players from the Camden high school joined and also knelt during the anthem.While Gordon and Ingram have knelt for most of the season, Friday night was the first time they were joined by Joseph and Ibeh, their assistant coaches. Ibeh draped an arm around both Gordon and Ingram, and Gordon hung an arm around Joseph.Together, the players and coaches bowed their heads and knelt in silence while the anthem rang through the night."The message is we're trying to stick together and form a brotherhood,” Joseph said. "Even though we may be from different cities, with so much violence going on we want to be sticking together.”NJ Advance Media staff multimedia specialist Andrew Mills contributed to this report.Matthew Stanmyre may be reached at mstanmyre@njadvancemedia.com.
