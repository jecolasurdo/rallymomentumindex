A peaceful protest involving about 20 people on the Black Lives Matter theme took place Monday evening in the Village of Carleton.At one point, the group got a Carleton police escort as they walked through the neighborhoods and they've since had a shout-out on the police department's Facebook page."This group was one of the most respectful groups of individuals protesting that (Chief Roy Johnson) has met in his 33 years of law enforcement. His exact words were that they were a 'class act,' ” the police department's post said.The protest organizers were Kenny Winecoff and Leah Verhille, according to Jake Griffith of Carleton, a University of Toledo student who was among those participating.Griffith said most of the participants were young adults, "voting age,” who live in or grew up in Carleton. But he said there also was at least one older woman who joined in the protest and some of the neighborhood residents cheered when they realized what the march was about.This event is part of a trend seen in recent days across the U.S. as demonstrators expressed their frustration over racism and its impact on society. Protests have taken place in numerous cities including Monroe, Toledo and Detroit."I think it's a nationwide issue. It doesn't just have to do with big cities,” Griffith said.The Black Lives Matter conversation is a few years old, but the discussions resparked in the aftermath of the May 25 death of George Floyd. He was the black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis while a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, pressed his knee against Floyd's neck.Griffith said Winecoff announced the event to contacts made through Life Takes, a blog at lifetakes.blog, where the discussions are typically on Michigan-area sports, entertainment and news from a young adult's perspective.He also used a Facebook event page, Snapchat and text messaging to invite friends to the demonstration in support of Floyd."I see a police officer. I think I'm safe,” Griffith said. "I just wish everybody could feel that way.”Before the gathering officially began at 5:30 p.m. Monday at Ash-Carleton Park, the organizers reached out to the Carleton Police Department to let them know what was going on.In response, the police department provided a patrol car escort as the group walked from the park to the corner of Monroe St. and Grafton Rd.The demonstration wrapped up with a few of them standing near the Speedway gas station at the corner.
