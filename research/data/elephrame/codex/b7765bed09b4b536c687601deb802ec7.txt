More than a hundred people showed up to protest the death in Minneapolis of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who was allegedly killed by a white police officer last week. The incident has sparked protests and deadly, destructive riots throughout the nation for the past week. But the event held in Davison was peaceful and was highlighted with speeches by Haido, State Rep. Sheryl Kennedy and others about racism, police brutality and inequality. The rally was followed by a march down Fourth Street to M-15, south along the sidewalk there to Clark Street, then back east to Main Street and north into downtown Davison. The police presence at the event was minor but was attended by the police chiefs of all three Davison area communities. There will be more about the protest in the June 11 Davison Index. – G.G.
