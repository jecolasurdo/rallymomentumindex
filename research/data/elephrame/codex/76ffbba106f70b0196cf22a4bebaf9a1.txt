GREGORY SHAVER, FOR THE JOURNAL TIMES Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Save RACINE — Protesters angry over the Wednesday afternoon police shooting that killed a 26-year-old Racine man took their concerns to the streets and to City Hall Friday afternoon.At least 200 people took part in a march from the scene of the shooting of Donte D. Shannon — a backyard in the 1400 block of Park Avenue — to the police station on Center Street before moving across the street and occupying the second floor of City Hall, at one point pounding on the mayor's office door.They remained there for about 40 minutes in an attempt to meet with Mayor Cory Mason. However, he was out of town in Madison for an Urban Alliance meeting with mayors from across the state. Then, at about 1:45 p.m., they reversed the route of their march, moving from Center Street to Grand Avenue, to 14th Street and then to Park Avenue in front of the house where two officers confronted Shannon after he had fled a traffic stop about a block away.Shannon died on the way to Ascension All Saints Hospital, family members say. Several said they were not notified that he had died until 4 to 5 hours later. Shannon's father, Nakia Shannon, said that he viewed his son's body later Friday afternoon at the funeral home. He says his son's body has 15 bullet holes, although police have not verified how many bullets were fired. At least six bullet holes were visible in the fence at 1409 Park Ave., where many members of Shannon's family and those who took part in the protest went to view the scene and pay their respects Friday. Although the level of chants escalated in front of the police station and inside City Hall, and a strong police presence was evident at City Hall and along the march route, police said after the march Friday that there were no problems other than a few brief traffic interruptions.Racine police received some help from the Racine County Sheriff's Office with march security and traffic control, but police said they were able to handle the march and provide regular service to the entire city without calling in further resources.Howell reaches out The Police Department has been limited in what it can say about Shannon's killing since the Wisconsin Department of Justice Division of Criminal Investigations has taken over investigation of the incident. Racine Police Chief Art Howell did, however, send an email to The Journal Times on Friday. "Regarding those who may have questions regarding the status of this investigation, please be advised that, shortly after this critical incident, Donte Shannon's father contacted me directly via cellphone. He and I (and other family members) met shortly thereafter at the Racine Police Department,” Howell wrote. "The exchange was very respectful and orderly, and Mr. Shannon was introduced to the lead investigating agents from the DCI. Mr. Shannon was further advised that, per Assembly Bill 409, at least two members from an independent (outside) agency must lead officer-involved shootings where fatalities are involved. At my request, the DCI was called in to handle this investigation.” Howell added: "In addition to personally meeting with the Shannon family and a number of local pastors, I met with representatives of the local NAACP as well.” Following the protest, Mason announced that a press briefing has been scheduled for 11 a.m. Monday at the Mayor's Office at City Hall, 730 Washington Ave., and said more details would be forthcoming at that time.Lingering frustrationsParticipants in Friday's march expressed frustration with lack of information on the incident and why lethal force had to be used. Chanting phrases such as "No justice, no peace,” "Whose streets? Our streets!” and "Black Lives Matter,” the protesters decried what they see as a long pattern of harassment and oppression of black people by some local police personnel. Most protesters appeared to be from greater Racine, although a few had come from out of town, such as Clyde McLemore, founder of the Black Lives Matter chapter in Lake County, Ill. There were no counter-protesters, although a white woman standing in front of the Racine police station wondered aloud why Donte Shannon ran and said she doubted protesters would ever be satisfied. She declined to be interviewed on the record. Handwritten signs carried by protesters demanded that all Racine police start wearing body cameras. T-shirts and sweatshirts had photos of Donte Shannon; one read: "Don't shoot me.”"I just wish we could get to some kind of understanding where we could sit down and talk to find out what we as a people need to do. Every life is important, you know what I'm saying? We as a people are tired of being repressed,” said Dorothy Massie, a resident of Racine for more than 20 years. Lifelong resident Sheri Price said that while there are definitely some good officers among Racine's ranks, she said she knows first-hand that there are some who are overly aggressive toward people of color.She said that in October, her 13-year-old grandson had been stopped by police and had a flashlight shined in his face. When a friend of Price's went to investigate, police voices escalated. As a result, Price's friend held a follow-up meeting with police command staff earlier this week."He told them Monday 'If you guys don't do something, something bad is going to happen.' And two days later, what do we have here?” Price said. Family seeks answersThe march kicked off at 12:15 p.m. Friday with an impassioned prayer led by Donte Shannon's aunt, Norma Johnson. "There's no need for people to be slaughtered like animals. We don't want anyone else to die,” Johnson said. "God, no one deserves this. He was a human being, God. He was loved, God. He was respected, God. He may have had problems, but we all do. So God, we would ask that you give us the justice that we need and deserve today.”Family members' emotions Friday ranged from grief to anger.Donte's grandfather, John Shannon of Racine, put part of the blame on a local justice system, with juries not representative of the makeup of the community and also on the media "because they never tell the whole truth.” He also took a verbal poke at police for the attempted traffic stop that led to Donte Shannon fleeing Wednesday afternoon."They said it was a traffic stop: About what? A front license plate that a cop doesn't even see because he's in back of you?” John Shannon said. "Just the reason to stop him is a made-up reason. "People ... need to know if they don't have a front plate on their car — and there are millions in Wisconsin who don't — they can be killed. That's what they need to know. Tell the whole truth.”Police have not confirmed any details regarding the circumstances that led to the stop. Among family members present was Donte Shannon's 5-year-old daughter, Nakhia, his only child. Family members said the girl had been told partly about the situation but family members said that closure for her would come later when the family got answers about Donte's shooting so that Nakhia would know "her daddy did not die in vain.” Friday services plannedNakia Shannon said funeral services for his son would likely take place next Friday, Jan. 26. Draeger-Langendorf Funeral Home & Crematory in Mount Pleasant is handling arrangements. Family said that the service would be a time for smiles, to honor Donte Shannon's "million-dollar smile.” "He was an outgoing person. You can see from the turnout here and the people who have been here for the last couple of days for him,” Nakia Shannon said. "He let people move in with him if they came out of jail and had no place else to go, he'd give the shirt off his back. For this to happen to him is unreasonable."I want him to rest in heaven and I want him to know that we won't forget about him and his family is going to live through him,” Nakia Shannon said.The gathering had cleared the area of Park and 14th by about 2:30 p.m.Alyssa Mauk, Brenda Wishau and Stephanie Jones contributed to this report. What's Next? WHAT: Officials are expected to make statements regarding Wednesday's police-involved fatal shooting during a press briefing.
