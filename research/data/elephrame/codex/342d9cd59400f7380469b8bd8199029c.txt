Fish, The Republic | azcentral.com Published 11:13 p.m. MT April 5, 2018 The LGBT and people of color walk in downtown Phoenix.(Photo: Cheryl Evans/The Republic)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREMembers of multiple activist groups marched in front of Phoenix Police Department headquarters on Thursday evening to promote two causes.Members of the LGBT community, as well as groups representing black and Hispanic residents, presented a funeral procession about 5 p.m. that went through downtown Phoenix and ended across the street from Phoenix Police Department headquarters near Seventh Avenue and Washington Street.Participants read off the names of those who were killed in 2016-17 in shootings by the Phoenix Police Department and performed a drag show.Protesters also called on organizers of this week's Phoenix Pride parade and festival to be more inclusive of people of color who also are LGBT."Basically, we all came together as black and brown organizations that have very strong trans and queer leadership," said Parris Wallace, a member of Black Lives Matter Phoenix Metro. "What we have come together to recognize is that the Pride parade is basically born on the backs of trans women (and) women of color (who were) against state violence," Wallace said.CLOSE Groups protest in front of Phoenix police headquarters on April 5, 2018. Nathan J. Fish/azcentral.com The Republic | azcentral.comProtesters included representatives of the Center for Neighborhood Leadership, Black Lives Matter Metro Phoenix, Ra√≠z of Planned Parenthood, Arizona Black Voters Initiative, Arizona Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violence, and Trans Queer Pueblo.The demonstration came ahead of this year's Phoenix Pride Festival this Saturday and Sunday in Phoenix."As a queer woman of color and a daughter of Mexican immigrants, I have experienced firsthand the violence enforced by police officers has negatively affected our communities," said Crystal Zaragoza, a health justice coordinator for Trans Queer Pueblo."For me personally, it's really important to be here to show solidarity of all my different intersections and all my different communities and demand that we have a safe Phoenix," Zaragoza said. Wallace said a central theme of their protest was to demand fair and safe treatment from Phoenix police. "I want people to be aware, I want them to question these institutions and hold them accountable and make sure that when someone is safe or is being protected they are truly being held that way," Wallace said. Groups also called for more representation in the Pride Festival"Last year, we interrupted Pride, the actual parade, to demand that pride and Phoenix pull the police out (of the event)," Wallace said. "This year, we are actually offering a future for black and brown queer folks here in Phoenix locally by starting our own traditions."We're not looking for a huge turnout to our events, we're just looking for representation in the Pride Festival itself."READ MORE:A year after snub at Pride Parade, Trans Queer Pueblo launches week of actionPhoenix Pride: The parade, performers and everything you need to know to attendLGBT community's uproar derails Phoenix councilman's bid for vice mayorFor more stories that matter: Click here to subscribe to azcentral.com.
