"If we don't get no justice, then you don't get no peace."Three-dozen protesters were there to demand justice for her son, Sam DuBose. Unarmed and black, he was shot and killed by white former University of Cincinnati Police Officer Ray Tensing during a 2015 traffic stop. Tensing said he feared for his life because DuBose was driving away, potentially dragging him under the car.Protesters with Countdown to Conviction Coalition gathered at noon in front of the Hamilton County Courthouse to demand to conviction of Ray Tensing in the murder of Sam DuBose. Tensing, a former University of Cincinnati police officer, shot and killed DuBose during a routine traffic stop on July 19, 2015. This is the second trial. The first ended in a hung jury. The presiding judge is Leslie Ghiz. (Photo: The Enquirer/ Liz Dufour)DuBose, who declined comment, had just sat through hours of testimony by use-of-force experts at Tensing's retrial and watched, frame by frame, Tensing's body camera footage of the shooting.She spoke privately with Brian Taylor of Black Lives Matter: Cincinnati. She has said Black Lives Matter stood by her and her family since the shooting. A few minutes later, even as another chant rose demanding a conviction and jail time for Tensing, DuBose moved through the crowd, saying, again in a near-whisper, "Thank you, y'all, for all you do."She crossed Main Street and talked briefly for a couple of minutes with a small group of supporters.Brian Taylor, with Black Lives Matters, left, Sam Katz, 23, of Corryville and McKenna Corey, 20 of Clifton Heights, join protesters with Countdown to Conviction Coalition who were gathered at noon in front of the Hamilton County Courthouse to demand to conviction of Ray Tensing in the murder of Sam DuBose. Tensing, a former University of Cincinnati police officer, shot and killed DuBose during a routine traffic stop on July 19, 2015. This is the second trial. The first ended in a hung jury. The presiding judge is Leslie Ghiz. Katz and Corey are both UC students. (Photo: The Enquirer/ Liz Dufour)The rally, featuring members of organizations that make up the Countdown to Conviction Coalition, ebbed and flowed, almost in sync with the rain that fell off-and-on through the noon-hour rally.At times, the rally reached a high energy level with prolonged chants of, "No justice, no peace, no racist police."Taylor spoke forcefully about Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Leslie Ghiz and her decision to prevent the prosecution from entering into evidence the T-shirt Tensing wore the day of the shooting under his uniform. The T-shirt bore an image of the Confederate flag.Ghiz explained she excluded the T-shirt from the retrial because any potential evidence value was "far outweighed" by its prejudicial value. The T-shirt was admitted at Tensing's first trial, which ended with a hung jury."She is currently using her position of power to shield, hide and cover up a key element to this trial, the Confederate flag shirt," Taylor said. "The shirt is something that does say something about the character of Ray Tensing. The fact that she, on her own, decided that it should be omitted, is the textbook definition of racism."Chants continued. "Enough is enough, put Ray Tensing in 'cuffs."Tensing faces murder and voluntary manslaughter charges. His first trial ended Nov. 12 when a jury could not reach a verdict.Hali Greene, a women's rights worker and Black Lives Matter member, led the chant early in the demonstration.Later, she said, "The only way to get our message across is to be in the street and be very vocal. It was murder."Aquashia Peterson, 21, of Walnut Hills, joins protesters with Countdown to Conviction Coalition who were gathered at noon in front of the Hamilton County Courthouse to demand to conviction of Ray Tensing in the murder of Sam DuBose. Tensing, a former University of Cincinnati police officer, shot and killed DuBose during a routine traffic stop on July 19, 2015. This is the second trial. The first ended in a hung jury. The presiding judge is Leslie Ghiz. Peterson is a student at Mt. St. Joesph. She's an intern with the Homeless Coalition and plans to be a lawyer. (Photo: The Enquirer/ Liz Dufour)Aquashia Peterson, 21, a Mount St. Joseph University student from Walnut Hills, held a sign reading, "Justice for Sam." The legal studies major plans a career in law and was appreciative to see so many white people defending the rights of DuBose."The larger community of people forget who we are as black people," Peterson said. "We need the majority with us to vote and help us. I would like to see more black people here, but it is good how it is."The Countdown to Coalition members include Greater Cincinnati Homeless Coalition, Black Lives Matter: Cincinnati, Students for Survivors, Cincinnati Socialist Students and Cincinnati Socialist Alternative.The group last protested May 31, marching from Inwood Park in Mount Auburn, not far from the scene at Rice and Valencia streets where Tensing fired a single bullet into Sam DuBose's head.
