While trying to get into her home through the back door, someone called the police, she said."Five cop cars pulled up, and all the police officers had their guns on me,” said Clark, now 35. "I was 14 years old. So, yes, I would say there is police brutality and there is racial profiling (in Grand Rapids).”Clark was one of thousands who showed up in downtown Grand Rapids Saturday, May 30, to protest police brutality.The protest – and others across the nation and in other Michigan cities like Detroit, Ann Arbor and Kalamazoo – was sparked by the turmoil in Minneapolis surrounding the death of George Floyd after a police officer knelt on his neck.Shouts of "I can't breathe," "Black Lives Matter” and "No justice, no peace” echoed through the streets of Monroe Center Street and Division Avenue for hours as protesters gathered outside the Grand Rapids Police Department headquarters at 1 Monroe Center NW. Others marched around the downtown area, some carrying signs with messages of protest."As a black person, I'm fed up,” Clark said. "These protests are necessary because a lot of people still don't understand what it means to be black in America. Blacks have built this country, and we get no respect, we don't get treated like humans."These protests are important because it brings awareness to brutality that black people are afflicted to, and it also brings awareness to just how hurt people are."The event started with a rally at Rosa Parks Circle in downtown Grand Rapids, where the protest's organizers urged attendees to remain calm, quiet and peaceful. Masks were mandatory, and the event was advertised on Facebook as a "Silent Protest.”Kaliyah Herman, 22, one of the event's four organizers, said her main goal was to keep Saturday's protest peaceful."We don't want anyone else getting hurt, we don't need people getting teargassed, we don't want people being shot,” said Herman, of Grand Rapids. "They're already doing that in other places. We don't need to do that too to get our point across.”But the protest turned rowdier once protesters marched to stand outside the police headquarters. Officers were awaiting the protesters and were lined up with their bicycles to form a barricade so protesters could not enter the building.Some protesters threw cans and bottles at the police officers, and in some cases verbally harassed the officers. At one point, Grand Rapids Police Chief Eric Payne came outside to say a few words to protesters; however, the protesters shouted over the police chief and he eventually gave up."I want to say I hear you," he said into a microphone, over shouts from protesters. "I've heard you my entire career. Black lives do matter.”The protest in Grand Rapids had not turned violent as of 9 p.m., as was the case in Detroit the night before. Detroit's protests on Friday, May 29, began peacefully but the situation turned hostile as the sun went down, as protesters could be seen circling a police vehicle waving middle fingers and swearing at police, The Detroit Free Press reported.Protesters and police in riot gear in Detroit eventually faced off near the Renaissance Center, with some people throwing rocks and bottles toward the officers. Police responded by charging toward the protesters, with punches thrown and gas canisters fired.In Grand Rapids, protesters outside the GRPD headquarters Saturday evening spray-painted messages on the building, including "Justice George Floyd” and "Who do you serve."As of 9 p.m., protesters were still gathered outside of the building. Police had gathered on rooftops and used drones and helicopters to keep an eye on the crowd.More on MLive:Protesters take to downtown Kalamazoo streets in response to George Floyd's deathHundreds protesting police brutality gather in Ann Arbor to 'make a change for our country'Man shot and killed, dozens arrested as 1,500-strong Detroit protest over George Floyd death turns violent'We are demanding justice:' Protesters in Detroit call for end of police brutalityMinneapolis demonstrations spark Black Lives Matter protest in downtown Bay City, Flint mayor statementNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
