Anybody who would seek to interrupt it would be callous, indeed, on this very special day.” Protests in New York have remained peaceful since the grand jury's decision.The streets of Ferguson were calm with the arrival of the holiday, in contrast to sometimes violent protests that took place earlier in the week. In New York, heavy security including bomb-sniffing dogs and police helicopters protected spectators of all ages who lined the route of the nationally televised Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, which counted Thomas the Tank Engine, Paddington bear and the Red Mighty Morphin Power Ranger among its six new giant balloons. Before the parade was over, snow flurries had replaced drizzle as thousands of people discovered they could get no closer than a long block away from the colorful spectacle. In Los Angeles, some of the hundreds of people arrested in protests there on Wednesday night said they had broken no laws and never heard the police order to disperse. Several said they inadvertently marched into tight areas where they became easy marks for arrest.On Thursday, with an additional 145 people jailed overnight, Chief Charlie Beck ordered all of the protesters released in time for Thanksgiving dinner."We were a little surprised that there was that many and frankly, a little disappointed,” Cmdr. Andrew Smith said. "All our actions are predicated on the behavior of the crowd. My understanding is that they gave multiple dispersal orders. ... And (protesters) would move down the street and continue the behavior that we consider unlawful” such as "blocking streets, banging on cars.” Los Angeles Times reporters heard police announce that protesters had four minutes to disperse or face arrest, but many in the crowd were chanting or had begun to walk away from the area, and it is possible that at least some did not hear the order.Those being released were asked to sign a promise to appear in court but were not required to post bail, Smith said. About the time of Beck's announcement, two bail bondsmen lingered outside the Metropolitan Detention Center downtown. They offered their cards and services to those who came to pick up their friends and family members — only to learn that the detainees had been released without bail. Police had been monitoring the protesters since about 3 p.m. Wednesday. In the coming hours, members of the group would block traffic, lie in the street, and at one point, attempt to take over the freeway, Smith said.Authorities eventually received information that the group was headed to Staples Center, so police stopped protesters, Smith said. Authorities used a sound truck to order the group to disperse, and after a lawyer informed officers that some protesters had not heard the order, police gave the order a second time, Smith said. "Nobody should have been surprised when they got taken to jail last night,” Smith said. "We gave them warning.” Charmaine Chua, 29, Los Angeles, was among those arrested.She said she had felt penned in by police and was taken by surprise when LAPD officers began making arrests. Chua insisted that authorities did not issue an order to disperse. "We were made an example of. The LAPD set out and intended to arrest us,” she said, adding, "I'm even more determined to keep organizing, and keep showing that the system that we live in is broken.” 0 comments Tags Business Arts And Entertainment General News Holiday Shopping Protests And Demonstrations Crime Weather Holidays Occasions Lifestyle Shopping Political And Civil Unrest Personal Spending Personal Finance Be the first to know Get local news delivered to your inbox!
