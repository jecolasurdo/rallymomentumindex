Oppong returned an interception 72 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter to give Doherty a 34-8 lead, and it turned out to be the deciding score in a 34-28 victory over Holy Name High at Commerce Bank Field at Foley Stadium. Before the game, Superintendent Maureen Binienda addressed the crowd. "I'd like to welcome everyone,” Binienda said, "to the game tonight. I want everyone to know that for the national anthem tonight I would like everyone to stand, but if you choose not to, you must do so peacefully. We invite everyone to stay for the game to enjoy the excitement of high school competition.” Then during the national anthem, Oppong kneeled, just as he did the previous Friday. This time, however, he was joined by three teammates: senior Devaughn Mitchell, senior Joseph Nyuane and junior Devon Taylor. The vast majority of the 50 or so Highlanders stood, and all of the Holy Name players did. A few fans remained seated in the stands, but most of them stood. More than half of the fans who formed the large crowd at the game didn't arrive until after the national anthem was played. Officials stopped allowing fans into the game in the second half. There were no outbursts on the field or in the stands. "I thought it was great,” Binienda said. "Everybody was peaceful. Those kids who decided not to stand, kneeled, but it was peaceful. The people in the stands were respectful. It was great.” In Doherty's season opener the previous Friday at Commerce Bank field, Oppong kneeled in protest during the national anthem, then tweeted on Sunday that he had drawn a one-game suspension from school officials. On Monday morning, the same Twitter account, @Oppong_5, said the suspension had been lifted. Later in the day, Oppong attributed his suspension claim to a "miscommunication” between him and his coach. Binienda said Monday that Oppong's coach had informed him that school officials may meet to discuss a one-game suspension, but no discipline was taken. Binienda said it would have been against the law to discipline a student engaging in a peaceful protest. After the game against Holy Name, Doherty coach Sean Mulcahy instructed his players to head to the team bus and that he would be the only one available to speak to the media. Mulcahy said he would talk only about the game, not what happened during the anthem. "I'll talk about his touchdown,” Mulcahy said of Oppong. "He's a heck of a player, and he made a big play when we needed him. He's got a lot to learn as a football player. They ran at him all night, and I thought he did better as the game went on.” Oppong said last week that he kneeled during the anthem to protest "injustice and inequality for a lot of black people nowadays,” and that he planned to kneel at other games. He said he was inspired by NFL players, including San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who refused to stand during the anthem to raise awareness of racial injustice. Kaepernick was among the many who retweeted Twitter posts in support of Oppong. There were also some threatening messages, prompting school officials to implement a safety plan. Friday night, camera crews from TV-3 in Worcester and Channels 4 and 25 in Boston traveled to Foley Stadium, and Robert Pezzella, Worcester Public Schools school safety officer, said they were informed to remain on the track that surrounds the field, but not to step closer to the field for safety reasons. Oppong's tweet of being suspended caused a firestorm. Binienda said she heard last week from media as far away as the London Times, Good Morning America and Associated Press, in addition to four Boston television stations. "I think it's good that students see something,” Binienda said Friday, "and they want to make a stand about it, but I think the stand should be more than just putting a knee down. I think they should do things in our community, they should become part of the solution and get involved in service and every day work with people so everybody learns to appreciate each other and everybody starts making a difference.” Karen Rossow stood on the sidewalk outside the stadium with a sign reading "Mass. Action Against Police Brutality,” and said she was supporting Oppong while handing out flyers about the Boston-based organization. Officials said no signs were allowed in the stadium. - Contact Bill Doyle at william.doyle@telegram.com. Follow him on Twitter @BillDoyle15. Never miss a story Choose the plan that's right for you.
