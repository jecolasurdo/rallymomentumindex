From the team's first trailblazers who won the very first Women's World Cup in 1991, to the iconic 99er's who captured the eyes and hearts of a nation, to the generation inspired by all of the above that now wear the Stars and Stripes with pride—the Women's National Team is, always has been, and always will be a force to be reckoned with on and off the field of play. They're warriors—the greatest in the world at what they do. Remember how much they've inspired an entire country. Dwayne "The Rock” Johnson500 WINS DOWN.COUNTLESS TO GO.The WNT reached its 500th win in program history when it defeated Portugal, 1-0, on Nov. 8, 2018.

Take a closer look at the impressive statistics across the 33-year journey that lead to this moment—an achievement that further cements the WNT as one of the most dominant squads in the history of sport, men or women.FULL STORYPROOF THERE IS NO STOPPING U.S.After an undefeated 2018 season, we doubt you'll need any more convincing of the USWNT's greatness. But we've got 18 more reasons why our women's team is unstoppable as they head into a World Cup year, stronger than ever as they attempt to own their fourth star. And if you have to ask? We believe that we will win.FULL STORYBEST ATHLETES IN THE WORLDFor decades, the USWNT has been topping podiums, making waves and racking up hardware as they prove to the rest of the world what grit and greatness looks like.
