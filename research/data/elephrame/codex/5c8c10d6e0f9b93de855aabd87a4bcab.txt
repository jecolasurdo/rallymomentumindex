These are the sights and sounds from the Black Lives Matter protest. At noon on Wednesday, Nov. 2, IU Southeast students and faculty participated in a peaceful Black Lives Matter protest in McCullough Plaza. The protest was organized by Zeta Phi Beta sorority. Students were covered in white sheets, some with their own names and how they died. These deaths were from recent events, including police shootings that occurred during traffic stops As the students and faculty lay covered on the ground, Martina Andrews, criminal justice senior, stood on a table nearby and delivered a speech about how Black Lives Matter and all lives as well. She then stood in complete silence with one arm raised to the sky while looking at everyone around her. all lives matterblack lives mattercampus protestcriminal justiceMartina Andrewspolice shootingsVeronica MedinaAbout the Contributor Jewell Conner, Business, Marketing, and Engagement Editor1 Comment Advertisement Tweets Tweets by @iushorizon Newsletter Navigate LeftCampusIUS sanitizes campus in response to COVID-19 pandemicCampusKameo Costello elected SGA president, SGA senate positions filled during latest electionCampusLiving six feet apart: the importance and effects of social distancingCampusSocial distancing and its effects on mental healthCampusIUS Art Department quickly adapts to finishing spring 2020 semester onlineCampusIU campuses set up Wi-Fi hotspots for students to use during the COVID-19 crisisCampusIUS Library reduces hours, shifts to digital access after suspending all face-to-face services indefinitelyCampusIndiana University suspends face-to-face classroom teaching over COVID-19 concernsBeerBeer expert Roger Baylor speaks about the history of beer in New Albany during IUS visitCampusIUS hosts annual Indiana Latinx Leadership ConferenceNavigate RightAbout Staff Archive Ad Info © 2020 The Horizon • Privacy Policy • FLEX WordPress Theme by SNO • Log in CloseClose Modal Window
