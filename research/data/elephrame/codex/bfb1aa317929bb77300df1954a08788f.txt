During one protest, coffins representing those killed were placed in a semi-circle outside of Oakland City Hall.

The city was already reeling from an ongoing scandal involving racist texts exchanged by some officers when, in early December, a large group of police officers surround 26-year-old Mario Woods, armed only with a knife, and fired at least 15 shots, killing Woods.

Thorn Coyle (@ThornCoyle) January 16, 2016 Protesters also gathered for demonstrations related to gentrification and labor issues in Oakland. While so much attention has been paid to San Francisco's rent prices, in recent years Oakland's rental prices have increased at a rate that outpaces that of its expensive neighbor across the Bay. Meanwhile, workers in Oakland making minimum wage saw a slight bump to start 2016 with hourly wages increasing by $0.30 an hour to $12.55.

And organizers are holding a large rally on Monday, to bring the four days of events to a close. Similar "Reclaim MLK" protests have also been held elsewhere over the weekend, including in Chicago and St. Louis, both metro areas that have been at the center of similar Black Lives Matter protests over the last year.
