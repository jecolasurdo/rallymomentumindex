Updated: 5:46 PM CDT Sep 16, 2016 Josh Planos Digital Editor Sterling Smith, a senior on the Lincoln Southeast football team, is making his voice heard.Just before the national anthem played before his team's Sept. 9 game -- a game in which he had a 40-yard touchdown reception -- against Lincoln East, the 6-foot-3 wide receiver, took a knee, just as San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick did throughout the NFL preseason and again on Monday night; just as an increasing pool of players and celebrities have done since. "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color," Kaepernick said after he was questioned about the decision. "To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.""I can't look in the mirror, and see other people dying in the street that should have the same opportunities that I've had and say, 'you know what, I can live with myself because I can't if I just watch."' Smith, who holds scholarship offers from North Dakota State, Northern Iowa and South Dakota State, according to Rivals, wasn't the only one who took a knee Friday; his teammate, Michael Baklykov, knelt alongside him. Since taking the action, both have received backlash online, just as many other players who have knelt during the anthem have experienced. He also received messages of support from classmates, friends and strangers.Saturday, he posted the following note on Twitter:"Growing up as a black and Hispanic young man in America I've learned quite a few things that could never teach me or prepare me for. I've learned that walking in the 'wrong neighborhood' past 10:00 o'clock wearing colored skin can get you questioned by the police because you clearly have ulterior motives. I've learned that blatant racism is only humor and that I need to 'not take it so seriously.' I've learned that going to a store will get you followed by employees because obviously your intentions are to steal. I've learned that ghetto is the new synonym for black. I've learned that addressing civil injustices placed on minority groups makes you another bitter black man who can't put the history books down."I've learned that the strides I've made in athletics are because of the color of my skin my and not because of the countless hours of work I've put in. I've learned that no matter what I accomplish, people will only look at me skin deep. But most importantly of all, I've learned I cannot stand idle in these times of turmoil. "I cannot deny the truth about oppression in this country. I wish I could tell you that I didn't understand what it's like to be targeted by the same system that swore to serve and protect all people, but instead continue to kill and neglect our people but I can't."These deeply rooted issues extend far beyond police brutality and the execution style shootings of minorities. Far beyond the new Jim (Crow) laws. Far beyond the institutionalizing and ghettoizing of youth like me for personal gain. Far beyond the government standing on the wrong side of history, once again forcing their will upon Native Americans in order to line their pockets."Oppression and the unfair treatment of colored people have plagued this country for too long and is disregarded too often. For this reason I choose to kneel with Kaepernick, not in disregard for the soldiers and veterans of this country, but to exercise my constitutional right in defiance to a corrupt government in order to stand for something much bigger. To stand against something much bigger. We must liberate ourselves."Smith told Marjie Ducey of the Omaha World-Herald that he plans to kneel once again in Friday's game against Omaha North.
