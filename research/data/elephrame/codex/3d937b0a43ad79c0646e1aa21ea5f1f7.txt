The peaceful group, estimated at more than 300 people, began the demonstration at noon at Veterans Park on Overland Avenue. The gathering stayed socially distanced while speakers addressed the issue of racism in the nation. Their hope? To break a systematic racism that has cycled through America for generations, they said. Chants of "No Justice, no peace. We want equality!” rang out in the crowed. Many were young, most donned masks.

Floyd, accused of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner convenience store, was killed when now-fired Officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for almost nine minutes while other officers stood by. All of the officers involved have been charged in connection with his death. Many in the crowd on Friday were young people. For them, it was a chance to express what they saw as deep injustice — one that unfolded before their eyes on a video. Standing up against that injustice was not just a choice, it was a responsibility, organizer Abigail Cregor, sophomore at Culver City High School, said. "This society has given me a privilege. This white privilege allows me to do so many things that people with darker skin can't do. And that's utter injustice. That's not right,” she said.

And they took a knee, an an 8 minute and 46 second silent vigil for Floyd.
