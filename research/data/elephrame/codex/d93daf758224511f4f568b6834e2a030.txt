(Photo: Michael Ciaglo/Getty Images) DENVER (KDVR) — More protests are taking place Monday in Denver calling for justice in the case of George Floyd. Protests started four days ago. They have generally started off peaceful, but turned violent as the days progressed. Saturday was no exception, as rioters vandalized and set fires near the Capitol and in the Capitol Hill neighborhood. On Saturday, Denver Mayor Michael B. Hancock announced a curfew of 8 p.m. until 5 a.m from Saturday night into Sunday morning and Sunday night into Monday morning. As of Monday morning, the curfew was not extended but we have reached out to the Mayor's office for additional guidance. Hancock also requested the support of the Colorado National Guard on Saturday, which was approved by Gov. Polis. Denver Police Chief Paul Pazen said police arrested 83 individuals on Saturday night for curfew violations, some had additional charges as well. On Sunday, protesters continued to gather in downtown Denver. FOX31 reporters said that protests felt mainly peaceful throughout the day and into the evening. Some protesters did not abide by the 8 p.m. curfew and disruption occurred. Police had to utilize tear gas, pepper balls and flash bangs after rocks and fireworks were thrown towards them. Below is a timeline of events that occurred Monday. Please note that the blog has been archived and is no longer being updated: Monday, June 1 10:40 p.m. Lots of fireworks, doing donuts in intersections Many fireworks have been launched into the sky, especially near Colfax Avenue and Lincoln Street.

Polis, Mayor Hancock issue statement on President Trump's remarks Gov. Jared Polis and Mayor Michael Hancock issued a joint statement in response to President Donald Trump's plan to possibly use military force against rioters: "Denver police, our mutual aid partners and a small contingent of Colorado National Guard have been working for the past four days and nights to support peaceful demonstrations in Denver. They have worked long hours under difficult conditions, especially as day turns to night. But there is no need for the deployment of US troops to maintain order in our city. The President's threat to deploy federal troops is counterproductive and will only stoke the potential for worse violence and destruction. Denver is not Little Rock in 1957, and Donald Trump is not President Eisenhower. This is a time for healing, for bringing people together, and the best way to protect civil rights is to move away from escalating violence.” 7:49 p.m.: Chief Pazen to hold virtual community meeting Denver Police Chief Paul Pazen plans to hold a virtual meeting at 6 p.m. Wednesday. According to DPD, Pazen wants to "start a dialogue.” More details are expected Wednesday morning.

Join him Wed., June 3 @ 6 PM for a virtual community meeting. Details on how to join will be shared Wed. AM. — Stay tuned! #Denver pic.twitter.com/Rr3hV4wXc6— Denver Police Dept.
