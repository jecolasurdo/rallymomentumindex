"It's hard to find a place called home," said Ariana Branford, 21, a senior from Reading and president of the African American Student League on campus. Branford, an African American student majoring in criminal justice and sociology, said few faculty and staff look like her. And even though 17 percent of La Salle's student body is African American, sometimes it's hard to find peers that look like her. "We know the university is working on diversifying and training," she said. According to the university's website, 11.6 percent of full and part time professors are members of minority groups. The site didn't break down how many were African American or Latino. Fifty-eight percent of La Salle's student body is white, according to the university's web site. The demonstration is among a growing number at colleges across the country as students begin to lift their voices about racial concerns.

Hanycz and several senior cabinet members stood with the students throughout the more than hour long demonstration, held in front of the quad on Olney Ave. During a faculty meeting last week, she encouraged faculty to join the students, too. "I stand with our students," said Hanycz, who became the university's first female president and first lay leader in July. "I'm very proud of their leadership and their willingness to come together." She said the "considerate dissension" serves as both a teaching and learning experience. Branford said Hanycz has supported her group from the beginning. "That really makes me happy," she said. Students said they have experienced some tension on the campus of 3,175 students, including comments made last fall on Yik Yak. Taylor Cammon, 21, a senior communication major from Baltimore, said she had been called a racial slur when she was a freshman. Andres Santana, 19, a sophomore from Reading, said he and another African American student were kept out of a fraternity party. "I come from a place where it's pretty diverse," said Santana, a criminal justice and sociology major. "It was like a wake-up call. This actually does happen." Ludmille Glaude, 19, a sophomore from Maplewood, N.J., said what's really irritating is when some La Salle students refer to "the locals" in a negative way. La Salle is situated in the Olney area with many African Americans as neighbors. "What makes us, as students, different from a local," asked Glaude, a political science major. "When students say 'oh my gosh, locals.' There's no differentiation in our eyes."
