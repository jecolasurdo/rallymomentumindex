The crowd walked through the 80-degree weather as protests across the U.S. continue after black people were killed by police. "Say his name," a protester called out."George Floyd," the crowd responded."Say her name," another person asked. "Breonna Taylor," the crowd yelled back. Those were the two people the crowd honored on Sunday. Floyd was killed in Minneapolis, Minnesota when a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds. Taylor was an EMT in Louisville, Kentucky who was shot by police after they entered her apartment with a 'no-knock' warrant. CLOSE NKY protestors march up the Dixie Highway to the Elsmere police station Cincinnati EnquirerSince those deaths, residents across the U.S. have continued to hold Black Lives Matters protests. Also on Sunday, about 20 minutes away across the Ohio River, thousands of protesters gathered in Cincinnati at Fountain Square for a protest. Chris Brown, of Elsmere, organized the rally for the Northern Kentucky city home to 8,642 people. She mingled with people she knew, directed where donated medical masks and snacks should go and pointed to who people should talk to to register to vote. "We're giving the people a voice right now to speak out against everything that they are not in agreeance with as it pertains to police brutality and racial injustice," Brown said before the group started the walk. Along the route, the protesters said Floyd's and Taylor's name, "no justice, no peace, no racist police," along with other chants. Volunteers stretched out their arms to offer cool water and passersby honked their horns from their cars. At the Elsmere Police Station, a few speakers talked about racial inequalities and suggested what the crowd could do next to push for change. Some urged them to vote to change policy and procedure. Others said to keep the conversation going by meeting new people. "Share your story," said Catrena Bowman-Thomas, 47, of Erlanger. Bowman-Thomas added that the rally was the most united she's seen Northern Kentucky since she's lived her. She told protesters they could invite the people they met at the rally to their homes for BBQ to keep the conversation going. "Northern Kentucky is not immune," from racial inequalities, said Northern Kentucky NAACP President Jerome Bowles during his speech at the rally. As the speakers finished their speeches, the sun moved closer to the west and people removed their sunglasses and hats. Water bottles were empty. The Transit Authority of Northern Kentucky transported protesters back to their vehicles. Some decided to walk back. They thanked volunteers for water and police officers for escorting them across the sidewalk. Brown told The Enquirer she wants to see more rallies and protests planned. "im hoping that every body goes out and continues to lend their voice to this," brown said. "We have to keep lending out voice to this, we cannot shut up, we cannot sit down, we have got to go the full gamut."Julia is the Northern Kentucky government reporter through the Report For America program.
