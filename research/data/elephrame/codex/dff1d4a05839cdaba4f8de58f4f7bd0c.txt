Twitter IGNov 27, 2016Share This StoryColin Kaepernick is at it again this week making headlines not about football, but rather for his political views and quotes that continue to piss many NFL fans off.The 49ers played the Dolphins in Miami on Sunday, and the controversial quarterback was met with a barrage of boos from fans at Hard Rock Stadium. It was for his comments in which Kaepernick defended the recently deceased Fidel Castro, not for his decision to kneel during the national anthem before the kickoffs of Niners' games.You can here the loud boos from the crowd when the 49ers had possession of the ball in the first quarter of the game in the clip above.According to the Palm Beach Post, Kaepernick was grilled on a media conference call on Wednesday by a Miami Herald reporter Armando Salguero about a t-shirt he wore back in August at a press conference that showed a meeting between Malcolm X and Castro."I'm not talking about Fidel Castro and his oppression. I'm talking about Malcolm X and what he's done for people,” Kaepernick said.The reporter, who comes from a family of Cuban immigrants who left deflected from Cuba, then accused Kaepernick of shying away from the question because it was "uncomfortable” to discuss about his alleged support of Castro. Kaepernick then reportedly replied to the Cuban-born reporter with, "One thing that Fidel Castro did do is [Cubans] have the highest literacy rate because they invest more in their education system than they do in their prison system, which we do not do here, even though we're fully capable of doing that."As the conversation continued to intensify, Salguero told Kaepernick that Castro broke many families up from his regime. Kaepernick then defended Castro by comparing the reporter's quip to the U.S. doing the same to Native American families:"We do break up families here." He added, "That's what mass incarceration is. That was the foundation of slavery so our country has been based on that as well as the genocide of native Americans."Kaepernick was then questioned if he parallels incarceration with breaking up families. He finalized his point when he stated, "I'm equating the breaking up of families with the breaking up of families."Miami is a huge Cuban-American enclave, where several families fled from Cuba to the south Florida border to exile the regime of the infamous Communist dictator. After Castro's death on Nov. 25, thousands in the Little Havana section of Miami rejoiced with no remorse.The Dolphins ended up beating the 49ers 31-24, and Kaepernick has led the Niners to the NFL's second worst record at 1-10.Send all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com.Sign up for the Complex Newsletter for breaking news, events, and unique stories.SubscribeRelated StoriesColin Kaepernick and Eric Reid Kneel, 4 Others Raise Fists During Anthem Colin Kaepernick Plans to Donate $1 Million to Charity, Become Involved in Community ActivismAlso WatchNews49ersColin KaepernickFansMiami DolphinsNFLGameCastroShare This Story
