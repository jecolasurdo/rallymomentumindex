Moore @KMooreTheLedger Sunday May 31, 2020 at 7:57 PM Jun 1, 2020 at 5:52 PM The violence that has plagued America in recent days arrived in Lakeland late Sunday afternoon when LPD had to use smoke bombs and tear gas to disperse a crowd of protesters blocking a major intersection. LAKELAND — Nearly two dozen Lakeland Police Department officers used smoke bombs and tear gas to disperse a large crowd of young protesters that had blocked part of the intersection at Memorial Boulevard and Florida Avenue late Sunday afternoon. The showdown came hours after hundreds of people had taken part in a peaceful Black Lives Matter rally held in downtown Munn Park. The rally in Lakeland was part of a nationwide movement of protests over the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis on Memorial Day. The incident Sunday followed a night of unrest in different cities across Florida, including Tampa where protesters threw rocks at first responders, burglarized 40 businesses and set fire to a gas station and a sporting-clothes store at a shopping mall, according to media reports. At about 4:30 p.m., the crowd was in the street and parked in several turn lanes along Memorial Boulevard and Florida Avenue when a maroon sedan tried to get past and hit a woman, knocking her down. Part of the crowd immediately jumped on the car and destroyed the front windshield and kicked in the back windshield before the driver sped off. Some of the crowd of about 150 people had participated in the Munn Park rally. They then walked from Munn Park about a mile to Salem's Gyros and congregated there and across the street in a small park on the southwest corner of the intersection. The Salem's parking lot was the scene of an officer-involved shooting in December 2018, when 17-year-old Michael Jerome Taylor of Winter Haven attempted to run over Officer Markais Nealin with a stolen Camaro. Taylor's death triggered protests by those concerned about police shootings involving young black men. Larry Giddens, who was police chief at the time, denied the shooting was racially motivated and investigators with the state attorney's office said the deadly force was justified.

Just before 5:30, Florida Highway Patrol officers and an LPD armored personnel carrier arrived and repeatedly ordered the crowd to stop blocking the intersection, telling them to get on the sidewalk. An LPD crowd control team of about 18 officers marched south on Florida Avenue, wearing helmets and carrying shields. One had a K-9 officer. They stopped across the street from the large crowd and put on gas masks as an officer on a loud speaker continued to ask them to get on the sidewalk. Then an officer in the armored vehicle opened a hatch and threw canisters of tear gas at the crowd. Some in the crowd threw the canisters back at the officers. The wind shifted and multiple people standing on the sidewalk watching felt the effects, including several journalists. After about 10 minutes of the confrontation, many who had blocked the intersection walked away onto neighboring side streets, although dozens remained on the sidewalks. Lakeland Police Chief Ruben Garcia said at least one person was injured Sunday afternoon, but none of the officers were hurt. The "crowd became unlawful and violent to citizens, injuries occurred, (the) crowd was asked to disperse many times and refused,” Garcia said in a text when asked why tear gas was used. "Crowd was given a lawful order to leave and still refused.” Deion Young, 24, of Auburndale, said he and his friends felt like the peaceful protest at Munn Park wasn't enough and so they joined the crowd at the intersection. "I feel very strongly about this, so that's why I'm out here,” said Young, who added that he has had family members beaten by the police. "There's a lot of wrong in the world." Kimberly C.
