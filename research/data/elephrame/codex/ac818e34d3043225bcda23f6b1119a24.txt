CBSN MinnesotaWatch Now Protests Interrupt Hennepin Co.'s Press Conference On Blevins Shooting No Charges Filed; Protesters Call For Arrest Of Officers InvolvedJuly 30, 2018 at 11:12 amFiled Under:Hennepin County Attorney, Mike Freeman, Thurman Blevins MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO/AP) — The Hennepin County Attorney's Office's press conference discussing the shooting of Thurman Blevins was cut short Monday due to protests. At the morning press conference, Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman began by offering sympathy to the Blevins family, and said "no one wins today” after body cam footage was released of the police shooting of 31-year-old Blevins. Freeman was about to announce his decision in the death of Blevins when community members began shouting. Freeman attempted to continue speaking, but eventually stopped and walked out of the conference room. Freeman was going to announce that charges will not be filed against the two police officers.

Body camera video released Sunday night showed Blevins fleeing from police while holding a gun. He was shot after a brief foot chase.
