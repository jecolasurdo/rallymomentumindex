Doherty player on anthem protest: 'There's a lot of injustice and inequality' - News - telegram.com - Worcester, MA Sections NewsSportsLivingObitsItemCarsJobsE-EditionSubscriber ServicesHomesWoMag Subscribe Site Archive Log in Subscribe Now Doherty player on anthem protest: 'There's a lot of injustice and inequality' Scott O'Connell Telegram & Gazette Staff @ScottOConnellTG Monday Sep 12, 2016 at 9:35 AM Sep 13, 2016 at 9:23 AM WORCESTER – A Doherty Memorial High School football player who kneeled in protest during the playing of the national anthem at a game last Friday has not been suspended, despite the player's initial claim on social media, according to the School Department.Superintendent Maureen Binienda said Monday morning that the student's coach told him school officials might meet to discuss the potential punishment of a one-game suspension. But Ms. Binienda said no such penalty will be given."That's against the law,” she said, because the player, Michael Oppong, was engaging in peaceful protest. "There's absolutely no discipline that's happening with that.”Sean Mulcahy, Doherty's head football coach, could not be reached for comment Monday.Mr. Oppong, a running back for the Highlanders, positioned himself on one knee, amid his standing teammates, during the playing of the anthem before the team's game against Leominster. The gesture was similar to silent protests some NFL players have made in recent weeks during the playing of the anthem, starting with San Francisco 49ers' quarterback Colin Kaepernick's decision to sit through the song in NFL preseason games last month.On social media, a tweet from an account appearing to be Mr. Oppong's indicates his action drew a one-game suspension from school officials. The tweet was posted Sunday. The next morning, the same account, which has the handle @Oppong_5 and named Black Lives Matter, said the suspension had been lifted.But Ms. Binienda on Monday said Doherty's principal, Sally Maloney, did not actually start investigating the incident until Monday morning. She and other school officials ultimately concluded Mr. Oppong did not act wrongly; the district does suspend students for disrupting a ceremony, Ms. Binienda explained, but the student's apparent protest did not fit that category.On Monday after the team's practice, Mr. Oppong called his initial claims of being suspended a "miscommunication” between him and his coach."It was just worded wrong,” he said. "We had a conversation about it today.”He said he was inspired to stage his protest after watching NFL players do it the past few weeks."I feel like there's a lot of injustice and inequality for a lot of black people nowadays,” he said, adding he plans to kneel for the anthem again at future games. "This is my way of being able to protest.”Since news of Mr. Oppong's situation began spreading on social media, posts in support of his action have poured in. Among the accounts that retweeted posts about his ordeal was an account belonging to Mr. Kaepernick himself."I'm proud I was able to bring a level of attention to this,” Mr. Oppong said.But there have also been some threatening messages sent to him as well, school officials said, which triggered the implementation of a safety plan for him on Monday morning."We have to treat this as a bullying situation,” said the district's school safety director, Robert Pezzella, who added the School Department was monitoring the insulting posts about Mr. Oppong.Ms. Binienda said one of Mr. Oppong's parents was also at the high school Monday morning as part of that safety plan.Ms. Binienda said she planned to meet with other Worcester coaches on Monday to go over the rules governing student protests. While those coaches can suggest players stand for the anthem, they can't punish them for not doing so, she said."I don't feel like there will be any more issues with this,” she said.Some of Mr. Oppong's teammates, however, said they plan to join him in a kneeling protest at an upcoming game. Senior Joseph Bolay said about half of the team had agreed to take part as of Monday afternoon."All of us on the team fully support Michael,” he said. "We want to show that we're behind him 100 percent.”Scott O'Connell can be reached at Scott.O'Connell@telegram.com.
