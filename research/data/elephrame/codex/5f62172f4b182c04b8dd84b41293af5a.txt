"We shut down Gay Street and we shut down business as usual, and everybody had to pay attention to us and understand a little bit of how we feel,” said David Hayes, one of the protesters. The crowd protested while waving flags and holding waterlogged signs to show their anger at the deaths of black people killed by police in separate incidents in Minnesota and Louisiana this week. And a night after police were gunned down during a similar rally in Dallas, they also cried out in hurt. Hayes helped lead the group from Market Square onto Gay Street, where they walked to Summit Hill and Gay. The march was mostly peaceful, though plenty loud, and undeterred by a thunderstorm and strong winds that swept through about 6 p.m. The evening ended with no arrests. Stopped drivers honked horns at the intersection, which was blocked by a human chain. One middle-aged white man left his vehicle and walked across the intersection to ask police to do something. He told one protester to find a job. The crowd repeated, "Black lives matter,” as the man walked back across the intersection. Traffic stopped for about 15 minutes, and protesters held a 1-minute, 15-second moment of silence for the 115 black people killed by police gunfire across the country this year. Knoxville police made way for the protesters by directing traffic around the vocal crowd. "If (drivers) feel a little agitated ... our deaths are affecting them,” Hayes said. "They're automatically — they're being affected.” Just after 7 p.m., the protesters walked back to Gay Street and onto Market Square. About 15 people left for Krutch Park to hold a quiet vigil, while the remaining protesters chanted onward through the shopping and dining district. Despite the rain and lightning, several groups of people gathered under eaves at shop fronts and restaurant awnings, watching the protesters. One store owner said he wouldn't talk about the matter for fear of losing business. A handful of couples dining in earshot of the protesters wouldn't comment.
