Protesters demand answers in Gunn's death Rebecca Burylo, Montgomery Advertiser Published 6:28 p.m. CT Feb. 28, 2016 | Updated 12:27 p.m. CT March 7, 2016CLOSE Black Lives Matter protest City, state and community leaders gather to speak out against Greg Gunn's death by a MPD officer(Photo: Rebecca Burylo)CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREMontgomery's black community doesn't want to resort to marches again similar to those of the Civil Rights Movement, but they will if they have to.McElvy Street in Montgomery's Mobile Heights neighborhood was packed with people Sunday afternoon awaiting to hear African-American city, county and state leaders make a stand with Black Lives Matter's local community group, in the death of Greg Gunn.Gunn, 58, was shot and killed by a Montgomery police officer Feb. 25 at about 3:20 a.m.Gunn's brother, Franklin Gunn stood with his brothers and sisters outside their mother's home where Greg Gunn was shot and killed. Gunn was heard calling out to his mother for help the morning he died."The family appreciates the concern and love expressed by so many in this community ... we ask that we be given respect and peace during this difficult time," Franklin Gunn said. "My mother is 80-years-old and she's having a very difficult time understanding the circumstances of my brother's untimely death."THE MONTGOMERY ADVERTISERAs anger over Gunn shooting builds, city leaders ask for patienceThe family and community leaders are not satisfied with how the city is handling the investigation, in what Rep. Alvin Holmes, D-Montgomery, called an "execution." They publicly made their frustrations known."There was no evidence that they had to kill him. He (Gunn) had no weapon, he did not attack the police officers. He was knocking on the next door and police shot him," Holmes said. "What we are asking is that the district attorney file first degree murder charges against him (police officer) and bring him before the Montgomery County Grand Jury."In addition, Holmes wants to see the officer immediately fired from his position with MPD and charged with violation of civil rights.The officer who shot and killed Gunn, is currently on administrative leave for 2-3 days. His name has not been released, but Police Chief Ernest Finley, said last week that the officer has been with the department for about four years.An element that may clear up confusion surrounding Gunn's death would be the video footage from either the officer's body camera or the police patrol car's dash-cam, said State Rep. John Knight."Over a year ago, the city announced they would have body cameras on all police officers, but now all of a sudden, they can't find the body camera footage. We're asking them to present to this community exactly what's on the camera," Knight said. "We can't wait forever ... we want transparency and we're not going to tolerate a cover up on this."Knight wants an agency from outside the state investigating Gunn's death. He does not have confidence in ALEA (Alabama Law Enforcement Agency), which he said is a "political arm of the governor's office."Local attorney Tyrone Means, who is representing the Gunn family, drafted a letter to send to United States Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, head of the Justice Department this week to request a special investigator be sent to Montgomery to investigate this case.Means does not believe the officer who killed Gunn to be in compliance with the state's 'stop and identify' laws and use of a deadly weapons when he did not face immanent danger, he said.ALEA, formerly known as SBI, the State Bureau of Investigations, is currently handling the case and all evidence has been turned over to their officers. Following the SBI investigation, the case will be given to the district attorney's office and go to grand jury.THE MONTGOMERY ADVERTISERPerspective: Police, Greg Gunn and the search for factsMany of those giving statements Sunday, said they did not want to indict all of Montgomery's police officers. In fact, Gunn's father was one of the first black officers to be sworn into the department, according to County Commission Chairman, Elton Dean.Dean, who represents the area, grew up around Mobile Heights and knew the Gunn family well. Greg was scared of guns and the police, Dean said."I want people to know Greg Gunn ... his daddy taught his family about law enforcement. Not one of his children broke the law," Dean said. "It's Greg this time, but it could be somebody else the next time.""The Gunn family and every family in Mobile Heights is peace-loving family. We grew up in this neighborhood, we'd go next door to borrow a cup-of-sugar or milk, we loved each other, parents could 'whoop' anybody, so as a product of this community, I don't want this to happen to anybody else here or any community," Dean added.Dean questioned why the leaders of Montgomery Police Department would send white officers to patrol a predominantly black community. Instead, men and women who grew up in those communities should patrol them.City, state and community leaders gather to speak out against Greg Gunn's death by a MPD officer (Photo: Rebecca Burylo)Chris Miles, a close friend of the Gunn family, said as a black man living much of his time in Mobile Heights, he does not feel safe with white officers patroling their community."I want to see all white officers out of the black community. I don't want them patrolling here anymore, because we're either 'suspicious,' or if something happens, they say they were in fear of their life. Those 'talking points' get them not indited. We can't live under those conditions anymore," Miles said.Representatives from local Black Lives Matter and Birthplace for Justice community groups were also present and made requests for Montgomery's mayor to answer at his press conference scheduled for 12:30 p.m. Monday."We would like a community police review board created at the next city council meeting," said Karen Jones, a community activist. "We're also asking the Montgomery Police Department to stop patrolling our black neighborhoods ... We are going to do our own community policing. When we call you, that's when we need you and you (police) will be our last resort."Several of those who spoke at the gathering, said they were not advocating violence or rioting, but they want the violence to stop."We cannot sit idly by and let our young men be shot down," Holmes said. "We don't want to start marches or massive demonstrations in Montgomery again, but we will unless something is done about this case.""We're going to have to stay vigilant," said Rep. Thad McClammy. "The main reason we're here today is to make sure they know that we're not going away."CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://on.mgmadv.com/1oRov3tFind JobsShare your feedback to help improve our site experience!
