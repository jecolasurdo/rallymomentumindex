Credit Justin Hicks/WVPE Black Lives Matter activists occupied the sidewalk in front of the County City Building in South Bend for 24 hours this weekend. They are continuing to demand the firing of the police chief more than a month after the fatal police shooting of Eric Logan. Starting at noon on Saturday, activists held workshops about citizens' rights in police interactions and wrote slogans with sidewalk chalk. As the evening drew on, they also read from the Bible together. Mmoja Ajabu came with others from Indianapolis representing Economic Freedom Fighters of Indiana. He says Mayor Pete Buttigieg should fire or at least demote Chief Scott Ruszkowski because the officer who shot Eric Logan didn't turn on his body camera. "So the buck should stop at the mayor's office. Mayor: If you're not going to hold the police chief accountable, then you need to resign,” Ajabu says. According to activist Jordan Geiger, they'll continue to demonstrate until the Eric Logan case is resolved or their list of demands is met.
