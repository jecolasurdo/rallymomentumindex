The self-described grassroots organization, Black Lives Matter 757, held five different marches across the region Monday night — the anniversary of the group's first march in 2016. Advertisement Marches were scheduled to take place in Norfolk, Portsmouth, Virginia Beach, Newport News and Hampton, all starting at 7:57 p.m. The only summons issued, though, was to the movement's organizer, Aubrey "JaPharii" Jones Jr. The summons was for obstruction of free passage of others, Hampton Police Division said in a statement Tuesday. The division increased patrols for the event, officials said. Advertisement About 20 people marched in Newport News during a Black Lives Matter 757 rally Monday night. Otherwise, they said "protesters were cooperative with our officers and remained on the sidewalk during the march," the statement read. But Jones said he'll be going to local and state legislators. "If that's how you choose to use state and city funds, we have a huge problem," he said by phone Monday night. He estimated hundreds of people walked in the five cities. Virginia State Police, including those on the tactical field force team, were dispatched to the cities to assist and were on standby, said state police spokeswoman Sgt. Michelle Anaya. No unusual incidents were reported, she said. They came with BearCats, or Ballistic Engineered Armored Response Counter Attack Trucks, she said. Some officers wore riot gear in Hampton. "It's a unity peace march. Why are you all here with tanks?" Jones said he asked officials.

In an email, Norfolk Police Department spokesman Daniel Hudson referred to the event as a "peaceful First Amendment march." Portsmouth's Chief of Police Tonya D. Chapman called the collaboration between Portsmouth police and fire, the Portsmouth Sheriff's Office and Virginia State Police as "professional and admirable." Communication, she said, is key. "Tonight's events could have run more smoothly if protesters had communicated more openly with the Portsmouth Police Department," Chapman said in a statement Monday night.
