Such civil rights protests began with San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick and have been mimicked throughout the country."Really, I just believe something strongly and I wanted to stand up for it,” Fant said when asked about his raised fist after the Hoosiers' 38-17 loss to the Buckeyes.There was an unconfirmed report that another Indiana player made a similar gesture. Fant said he didn't know about that.Fant is a junior from Atlanta, home of the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site.He said his message was that "we're all equal” and that "diversity's great.”He continued: "We're one. We have to be one. We're a unit. We're a team. The United States is a team.”IU athletic director Fred Glass told a faculty council meeting that there would be no repercussions against Hoosier athletes participating in protests against racial injustice.Call IndyStar reporter David Woods at (317) 444-6195.
