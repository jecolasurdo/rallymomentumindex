(Phil Rockrohr/Pioneer Press) About a dozen parents and community members gathered outside of Oak Park and River Forest High School in below-zero temperatures as school started Monday morning. They said they were there to show support for staff members recently placed on administrative leave and students inside the school who were staging a sit-in. On Friday, OPRF teacher and community activist Anthony Clark said that he had been placed on administrative leave. Community members said another staff member also had been placed on leave. Advertisement On Monday, speaking to the community members, OPRF Superintendent Joylynn Pruitt-Adams said that the staff members were not "accused of anything.” She said the staff members were not suspended, but rather placed on "administrative leave of absence” while an investigation is conducted. "There are no findings,” she said. "I can't talk any further about the issue because it's a personnel matter.” Advertisement In an email sent to families later in the day, Pruitt-Adams that about 120 students came to the student center at the beginning of second period and remained sitting on the floor for the remainder of the school day. In that email, she wrote that having staff members placed on leave "is not a decision of wrongdoing but rather a standard approach when the District is conducting a personnel review.” [Most read] Coronavirus in Illinois updates: 44 more deaths reported as COVID-19 continues to impact Black people at greater rate; Chicago says restaurants can open for indoor dining next Friday » School officials also noted that a school board Town Hall on Racial Equity and School Safety was set from 6:30 to 9 p.m. Thursday, March 7, at the OPRF South cafeteria. OPRF officials previously had addressed a student walkout that took place on Feb. 26, on the anniversary of the shooting death of Trayvon Martin. A letter that had been sent to families, signed by Pruitt-Adams, noted that "faculty and staff are not permitted to promote or participate in the walkout.” Clark was with the students during the Feb. 26 walkout. On Monday morning, Oak Park resident Mak Flournoy said the community members were "here to support the students.” "They have a voice they want to share,” Flournoy said. "The students are dealing with the administration. At the heart of it is two beloved staff members suspended in connection with their activities related to the protest.” Pruitt-Adams, noting they had not been suspended, declined to say whether the staff members were placed on administrative leave because they left school during the Feb. 26 protest.

He de-escalated a situation when the middle schools students started to get upset,” Flournoy said. "He calmed the students down and walked back with them. He offered nothing but love and support. He did nothing wrong.” During the Feb. 26 march, students left the OPRF building at about 11:30 a.m., and they went to Julian Middle School, where the protest continued at that school's front entrance. The group of students chanted for Julian Principal Todd Fitzgerald to come outside to address the crowd, with an OPRF student saying school administration refused to allow them to hold a demonstration at Julian for the anniversary of Trayvon Martin's death. Clark calmed the group, saying Fitzgerald and Oak Park District 97 Superintendent Carol Kelley would address the crowd. Clark issued a statement after confirming he had been placed on leave.

"I didn't create the systemic issues we all face, but I am one of the many truly working to create systemic solutions, solutions that would fundamentally change our educational and criminal justice systems.” Advertisement "Therefore, when pushing for change, I will always place supporting students and families before supporting a broken system that attempts to dictate and define how that change should occur and how those harmed should express,” he added. "If I and others are to be scapegoats to institutional failures, so be it, as long at it leads to communities where all stakeholders have access to opportunity no matter their race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, ability, immigrant status, religion, or age.” After the walkout, Pruitt-Adams sent an email to families that stated that as she reflected on the events of the week, she was "troubled.” "I am concerned that students increasingly are choosing to forego the opportunity for dialogue in favor of more drastic action,” Pruitt-Adams' email stated. "During Tuesday's march, roughly 200 students missed four periods of class time, creating a disruption not just to their education but to their classmates' as well.” After learning that students had planned action on Monday, Pruitt-Adams sent another email to families on Sunday, in which she stated that "we are more than willing to have discussions about students' concerns.” Last week, OPRF's board approved a new position, which will carry the title of executive director of equity and student success.

"The teachers are part of the reason we're here,” Griffin said. "We're here to support students who feel their needs are not being met. They feel invisible.” Pruitt-Adams said she planned to make a statement to students regarding the leaves of absence "that would not break protocol” for personnel matters. She said parents, community members and reporters would not be permitted to attend Monday's sit-in inside the building.
