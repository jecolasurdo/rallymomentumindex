It's a health care issue.' By Heidi Stevens Chicago Tribune | Jun 05, 2020 | 1:29 PM Hundreds of health care workers flooded the plaza outside Northwestern Medicine Prentice Women's Hospital on Friday morning for a #WhiteCoatsforBlackLives demonstration that covered the sidewalks on both sides of Fairbanks Avenue from Superior Street on the south to Chicago Avenue on the north. At 8:30 a.m. sharp, the crowd of doctors, nurses, residents, technicians and other medical professionals grew silent and took a knee. They stayed that way for 10 minutes. Some bowed their heads. Some raised a single fist. Some held signs in the air: Advertisement DO NO HARM RACIAL BIAS = HEALTHCARE INEQUITIES Advertisement BLACK TRANS LIVES MATTER. WE STAND TOGETHER. It was an incredibly powerful display of solidarity and resolve from some of the frontline workers tasked with battling Chicago's duel crises of COVID-19 and racial inequality. "It's not just about this single, 10-minute gesture,” said Parul Gupta, an obstetrics and gynecology doctor who helped organize the demonstration. "It's about what we're going to do next. How we're going to deal with teaching implicit bias, as we already do with our medical and resident students, but also with the faculty and the private faculty as well. This is not a political issue. It's a human rights issue. It's a health care issue.” Chicago has the largest life expectancy gap in the nation, with residents living in Streeterville — the neighborhood where Friday's demonstration took place — living to an average age of 90, while residents in predominantly black Englewood live to an average age of 60. Black moms in Illinois are six times more likely to die from pregnancy-related conditions. The rate of asthma in Chicago is almost 75 percent higher among black residents than white residents. "The disparities in health care are very pronounced,” Gupta said. "And we're seeing the increase in those disparities highlighted through COVID-19. This hits very close to home for us.” LaTasha Nelson, a maternal fetal medicine doctor, kneeled as a health care provider and a mother. "I have two black sons,” Nelson said. "I think about my boys, and I wonder at what point do they stop being adorable and start being a threat to people.” She said she was encouraged to see so many of her peers show support for black lives. "I work in high-risk obstetrics, so I see the disparities in health care for African American women,” Nelson said. "I see it in my own family. My cousin had a bilateral pulmonary embolism and they sent her home three times until I called and said, 'No. You need to see her.' There's a lot of work to do.” Higgins Durand, a student in Northwestern Medicine's physician assistant program, said he was there to show support for the protesters filling the streets in Chicago and across the globe in response to the killing of George Floyd. "It's important that people understand that medical professionals, including myself, especially myself, are in support of the movement,” Durand said. "We understand.” Durand wore a "Child of Immigrants” pin. His parents were both born in Haiti. Advertisement "Every little bit matters,” he said. "Even if it's just me kneeling here, I hope that whoever sees a picture of all these white coats will be inspired to do their part.” Dinee Simpson, an organ transplant surgeon, said the demonstration also offered an outlet for health care workers who haven't been able to attend protests. "I was on call last week and it was incredibly difficult for me not to be able to participate in the marches or protests because I would've been there in a heartbeat,” Simpson said. "For us to come together and express what we're feeling here, to express our grieving and our pain and have the support of one another, it means a lot. We feel heard." Simpson, who I profiled last year, is the director of Northwestern's African American Transplant Access Program, which works to make organ transplantation more accessible to members of high-risk communities. "I hope this lets people know that we as a Northwestern community are here for our entire community,” Simpson said, "not just the demographic we might be stereotyped for. It's incredibly important for passersby to see the solidarity of this hospital and the support of this community.” Similar demonstrations are taking place throughout Chicago and the nation Friday. At some medical facilities, including Advocate Medical Group Outpatient Center in Orland Park, health care workers kneeled for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, the amount of time Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin kept his knee on Floyd's neck.
