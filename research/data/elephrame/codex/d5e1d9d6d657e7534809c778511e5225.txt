TriMet's Orange Line trains were moving again late Wednesday afternoon after protesters stopped traffic outside City Hall. That contract guarantees pay raises for officers and drops a number of union grievances filed against the city. Don't Shoot PDX activists and others who had camped inside City Hall after the vote were forcibly removed by police in riot gear, who at times used pepper spray on the crowd. In response, some people threw water battles at officers. Police made a few arrests during the confrontation, but were not immediately able to confirm who was arrested. Throughout the afternoon, protesters repeatedly moved into the streets around City Hall to interrupt traffic, at which point police would return to the area to remove them. Police said one officer was injured in the confrontation. The officer was not seriously hurt. Groups camp out to protest vote City Commissioners Amanda Fritz and Nick Fish joined Mayor Charlie Hales in voting to ratify the agreement during Wednesday's meeting. Commissioner Steve Novick voted against it, citing fiscal concerns. Commissioner Dan Saltzman was absent from the meeting for the Yom Kippur holiday and did not respond to a request for comment. Protesters with the group Don't Shoot PDX had vowed to stop the vote. Many spent the night camped out in tents in front of City Hall. They say the agreement doesn't do enough to ensure that officers who use excessive force will be disciplined or fired, and they have called on the mayor, who has less than three months left in office, to let Mayor-elect Ted Wheeler renegotiate the contract. A wide range of police accountability groups, including the ACLU of Oregon, Portland Copwatch, the city's elected auditor and the director of the Independent Police Review division of the auditor's office, objected to the contract. They raised concerns about the contract and a draft body camera policy that Hales and the police bureau released at the same time. After protesters disrupted the council's morning meeting Wednesday, Hales briefly adjourned the hearing and called in police officers to control the crowd. Approximately 20 officers stationed themselves in the stairwell in City Hall, blocking protesters from the small room on the third floor where the council reconvened to take its vote. Fritz's apology before vote For the second time in a week, the general public was excluded from the city council's meeting. Journalists and people who had signed up to testify on council agenda items were allowed to enter. Video of the meeting was streamed live online. Protesters have threatened to sue the mayor over his decision to exclude members of the public from meetings that have become unruly this week. Dozens of protesters, some with megaphones, remained on the second floor, chanting "Black lives matter.” At times, it was difficult to hear members of the council speaking over the noise of the protesters downstairs. As she cast her votes, Fritz acknowledged at length the opposition to the contract. "Many of the people who I respect most in the entire world have urged me not to vote for the contract,” she said. "Obviously, the easiest path today would be for me to vote no.” She offered an apology for the city's slow progress on racial equity issues and police reform and thanked many of the protesters who opposed the deal by name, including Don't Shoot PDX leader Teressa Raiford. "I am sorry for my part in failing to achieve more reforms. I apologize for not succeeding to improve community trust in the police bureau. I apologize to every Portlander who has experienced disparate treatment from police officers,” Fritz said. But Fritz said she decided that the costs of opposing the contract were greater than the cost of approving it. She was swayed, she said, by the need to fully staff the police bureau and the risks of having officers regularly working overtime. "Everywhere I go, community members are asking why their neighborhood doesn't get needed police attention,” she said, casting her vote. Fish also cited the police bureau's staffing shortage and recruitment challenges as his reason for ultimately supporting the contract. "Response times (for 911) are six minutes or longer, putting all Portlanders at risk,” he said. "We have a shortage of 65 officers and 23 vacancies to come this month. The trend is only getting worse.” After the council cast its vote, chants of "Shame on you” echoed through City Hall.
