About 25 protesters picketed a building that houses the officers of the city's largest police union Wednesday morning. Ten protesters showed up at about 8 a.m. at 125 Broad St., and tried to get up to the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association's offices but were blocked at the lobby turnstiles by security, witnesses said.

In all, about 30 people participated in the protest, which was organized by the Black Youth Project 100 and a Million Hoodies.

Williams/New York Daily News) The groups said they want to "defund" the PBA because it "protects and defends" cops who kill black people, according to a spokesman. One protester called the PBA a "fake a-- union." The PBA is funded by members' dues. They also demanded the NYPD fire Officer Wayne Isaacs, who shot and killed Delrawn Small in Brooklyn on July 4 during a road rage confrontation. The protesters carried signs which read, "PBA protects killer cops" and "Stop cops, fund black futures."

They should be supporting the police officers, who are out here protecting their right to protest."

Lynch said he had no plans to speak with the protesters. Demonstrators called for the PBA to be "defunded.” (Reggie Lewis/New York Daily News) Roughly 30 employees of the American Civil Liberties Union, including some lawyers, came to the lobby and joined the protesters in chanting. Organizers said the protest will be followed by a "national day of action" Thursday. "New York has a very strong activist community that supports people when they take action," said Amity Paye, a member of the Black Youth Project 100. nypd pba black lives matter Recommended on Daily News Advertisement Latest New York Queens panhandler carjacks Jersey woman's car with her still sitting in the driver's seat, 11-mile chase follows: cops 3h Boyfriend freed without charges after fatal stabbing inside Bronx apartment 3h Juneteenth holiday sparks activism across NYC and nation 3h Advertisement Most Read • New York SEE IT: Man blocks door of Brooklyn coffee shop demanding worker remove 'Black Lives Matter' sign Jun 18, 2020 'The pain is too much for me': Sister mourns death of Bronx man who perished from head injury hours after trying to stop street fight 9:09 AM Advertisement Most Read See more Most Read articles SEE IT: Man blocks door of Brooklyn coffee shop demanding worker remove 'Black Lives Matter' sign Jun 18, 2020 Chavis Carter committed suicide in back of police car: autopsy Aug 20, 2012 Teenage security guard shot and killed by Los Angeles police during shift at auto shop 5h Advertisement Advertisement
