(Photo: Nusaiba Mizan)GREEN BAY – University of Wisconsin-Green Bay students protested police brutality in honor of Atatiana Jefferson on Monday during rush hour in downtown Green Bay.Jefferson, 28, was slain while playing video games with her nephew in Fort Worth, Texas. A white police officer fatally shot Jefferson, a black woman, through a window in her home while conducting a welfare check. A Dallas native, Jefferson was an aspiring medical student. The officer, Aaron Dean, resigned and then was charged with murder.UWGB student Hannah Beauchamp-Pope is a member of Black Student Union and Phi Theta Nu, a multicultural and gender inclusive sorority."Today is a National Day of Outrage. It's a nationwide protest, but I knew that they weren't going to have anything in Green Bay, or in Wisconsin even," Beauchamp-Pope said.She gathered friends and campus leaders to coordinate a protest. Ten people demonstrated with chants and signs from 4:30 p.m. to 6 p.m as people left work.National Day of Outrage demonstrations were planned in at least 15 cities by the social justice organization Until Freedom. Cities included Detroit, Fort Worth, New York, Washington D.C., Las Vegas, Dallas, and Houston, ESSENCE reported.Post by blacklivesunitedgb."We brought this to Green Bay because we do have people of color here," Beauchamp-Pope said.Beauchamp-Pope said even though Jefferson's slaying happened in Fort Worth, police brutality happens all across the country."We're just fed up, you know what I mean? I think that people in this country just turned a blind eye because it happened so much," she said. "But, if anything, we should be more and more upset every time it happens." Student Zoe Betancourt referenced a long history of brutality against people of color including the slaying of 14-year-old Emmett Till in Mississippi in 1955. He had been accused of offending a white woman in a grocery store."We're going to take it back to Emmett Till. And even before then," Betancourt said. "So it's actually pretty ridiculous we're still fighting for equality right now."The protest ended at the Brown County Courthouse, which students said they chose because it's a site where justice should prevail. Betancourt read Maya Angelou's poem "Still I Rise" and attendees shared closing remarks.Beauchamp-Pope spoke of women of color who were killed, or who died while in police custody."For every Tamir Rice, there's a Sandra Bland. For every Eric Gardner, there's a Kayla Moore. For every Freddie Gray, there's a Shelly Frey. For every Michael Brown, there is a Yvette Smith," Beauchamp-Pope said.Protestor Meredith Kohlbick noted that more than 700 people have been shot and killed by police officers in 2019 so far. The number, as of Oct. 28, is at 734 people, according to The Washington Post.In closing remarks, Betancourt said, "You can see that a lot of people were kind of shocked that we had this presence, because it's Green Bay, Wisconsin. It's predominantly white. You don't see much of retaliation against police brutality and for the equality of people of color."Contact Nusaiba Mizan at 920-431-8310 or nmizan@gannett.com.
