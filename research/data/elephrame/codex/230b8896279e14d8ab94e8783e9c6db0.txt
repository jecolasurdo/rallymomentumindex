Mayor meets with Don't Shoot Portland activists outside City Hall after moving afternoon meeting - oregonlive.comSkip to ArticlePortlandMayor meets with Don't Shoot Portland activists outside City Hall after moving afternoon meetingUpdated Jan 09, 2019; Posted Sep 27, 2016 By Samantha Matsumoto Don't Shoot PDXDon't Shoot PDX activists gathered Tuesday, Sept. 27, 2016, at City Hall to discuss police brutality with Portland Mayor Charlie Hales.(Samantha Matsumoto/The Oregonian/OregonLive)Mayor Charlie Hales met with members of a Portland activist group Tuesday evening, addressing concerns about protest policing and purported police brutality, among other topics.Protesters from activist group Don't Shoot Portland also queried him about police discipline and training, racial profiling and what he's doing to help black people during an informal Q&A outside City Hall.The meeting took place more than 3 hours after schedule, as Hales said he moved the forum to a Northeast Portland church because he didn't want to see protesters occupy City Hall.But activists stayed put outside City Hall -- which they adorned with a large banner proclaiming "#BLACKLIVESMATTER" -- until he arrived. Some speakers voiced their disapproval about him moving the afternoon meeting."They shut down City Hall, they misdirected our community by telling them we all intended to move this meeting to Northeast Portland," Teressa Raiford, one of the Don't Shoot leaders, said earlier Tuesday.After Hales left the meeting some 50 minutes later to a chorus of unpleasantries, a group organizer voiced a series of demands.Gregory McKelvey, also the group's spokesman, said the group demands Hales doesn't sign -- and comes out against -- a contract between the city and the Portland Police Association. The City Council is scheduled to discuss the agreement Wednesday morning.He said the group also demands "an end of police brutality" at their protests, that gang-enforcement officers don't police their protests and that talks start about phasing school resource officers out of city schools.Hales said he told the group about the change of venue, which he also posted about on Facebook. McKelvey said Hales reached out to a member of the group who isn't one of its leaders.Don't Shoot Portland is an off-shoot of the "Hands Up, Don't Shoot" movement sparked by the 2014 death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. The 18-year-old black man was unarmed when he was fatally shot by a white police officer, sparking protests in major cities across the country.Numerous deadly, high-profile shootings have been documented across the country ever since, including in Baltimore, New York and Chicago. The fatal shooting of Keith Lamont Scott, 43, sparked days of protests last week in Charlotte, North Carolina. In Tulsa, Oklahoma, prosecutors have charged a white police officer with manslaughter for killing 40-year-old Terence Crutcher, an unarmed black man, on Sept. 16.Crutcher and Scott are among at least 715 people -- nearly a quarter of them black -- killed by police this year, according to the Washington Post, which maintains a national database on police shootings.The meeting comes on the heels of a Friday demonstration against police brutality, in which about protesters staged a 41/2-minute "die-in" on the Burnside Bridge and later entered City Hall, demanding to speak with Hales.Hales told protesters Friday that he and Portland Police Chief Mike Marshman would meet with them Tuesday afternoon at City Hall.One person was pepper-sprayed during Friday's march after he "charged an officer or officers," Portland police spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson said.Micah Rhodes, one of Don't Shoot Portland's leaders, said officers pepper-sprayed him after he tried to stop one of them from riding a bicycle into a protester.Rhodes ran up to the officer and told him to stop. Then, an officer cursed at him and pepper-sprayed him, he said.Raiford said many officers were aggressive and attacked protesters."We were brutalized and attacked by force," she said.The protesters went to the mayor's office on Friday to discuss their concerns about officers with him, Raiford said.McKelvey said members of Don't Shoot Portland plan to stay overnight outside City Hall and attend the City Council meeting Wednesday. Don't Shoot Portland holds a press conference in front of City Hall addressing police brutality.Posted by The Oregonian on Tuesday, September 27, 2016-- Samantha Matsumoto and Jim Ryansmatsumoto@oregonian.com; jryan@oregonian.comNote to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).Â© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
