Vigilant police swarmed within seconds and dragged the man, later identified as 24-year-old Caleb Burris, out of the crowd. He was later charged with battery.

For many in attendance, the arguments were either historically, racially or politically motivated. Shouting between the two sides went back and forth during the roughly five hours of protest as the controversy of the statue itself was lost among the bigger issues it represents for each side. "We've got something you'll never have – pride and identity in the South. We've got the South,” one protester shouted across the street to a wall of opponents holding signs reading statements such as "your racism isn't patriotism” and "history has its eyes on you.”There were hugs and handshakes, but also hatred and swearing, as the groups that were once separated by Palafox Street converged together in the square about two hours into the protest.The estimated 30 Pensacola Police Department officers rotating in and out of the area gathered in closer to the crowds as they became confrontational, standing silently by in case the situation became violent. PPD spokesman Mike Wood said the crowd stayed generally well-behaved, and the officers had planned to stay out of any confrontations unless it was necessary to intervene.More:Watch: Protesters, anti-protesters meet at Lee SquareOn one side of the argument was a crowd of men and women carrying posters with everything from Nazi swastikas, confederate flags to phrases honoring the history of the monument. The same group intermittently began singing the "Star Spangled Banner” and "America the Beautiful” in an attempt to drown out the crowd on the opposing side, which at that time was largely made up of "Black Lives Matter” protesters.Keith Altarac of Pensacola carried a Confederate flag and a Florida flag as he stood by the monument around 9 a.m. He is not a veteran, but said the issue is about veterans' rights. He claimed it was largely the people who were upset about the outcome of November's presidential election who were the ones in favor of removing the statue.Many of the rally crowd in favor of keeping the statue touted its history. They said it's an ode to the Confederate soldiers who lost their lives, and isn't referencing slavery. It's a piece of the South, many shouted across the square."What's fair to one is fair for the other, and if they're going to take down the Confederate monument they need to take down the Martin Luther King statues,” said Barbara Jernigan of Pensacola. "It's not because of the color of the skin, it's about attitude.”The anti-monument crowd was often just as heated, particularly as the crowd thinned out and only the most vocal remained.Many refused to speak with the press as they chanted phrases like "No Klan, No CSA, No fascist USA”, and "don't forget what Nazis did.”One of the Black Lives Matter organizers told those in the anti-Confederate statue group there were a number of volunteers on site who had been trained in de-escalation techniques who would be helping throughout the day to avoid confrontation.Amid the shouts of both sides around 10:30 a.m., a small group of anti-Confederate monument protesters walked across the street and began speaking with a pro-Confederate monument protester. It was the first time throughout the rally the two sides had spoken face-to-face. After a few minutes of conversation, they shook hands and some hugged. Jermaine Williams, who was among the group that crossed the street, said he wanted to see what they had in common."I just wanted to come over here and talk because we can't hear each other over here," Williams said. "To be honest, despite what they say, none of them has met or spoke with a young black male from the inner city."More anti-Confederate protesters followed and once the two groups merged, chanting was instead replaced with smaller groups of opponents shouting at each other. People started using whistles, megaphones and air horns in attempts to silence the other side and get their message across.Police moved in as one woman against the monument began stomping on the opposing side's Confederate flag. A supporter then tried to rip the flag out from under her feet, and both sides appeared to get closer but settled down as police stepped in.One older white woman, who was later removed from the megaphone by someone trying to alleviate the tension, told a young black woman she was "probably off having another baby every nine months.” The young black woman replied that she has two degrees and no children.Their confrontation grew progressively worse – and racial – as the two women screamed at each other.Others were quick to point out that neither woman involved in the argument should be considered a representation of either side. The verbal fight was enough to prompt many in the crowd to leave the rally altogether before noon.The crowd that PPD once estimated was about 300-people strong had dissipated to fewer than 100. The police presence grew increasingly tighter and the representatives from each side trying to mitigate the confrontation become more involved.With less that a couple dozen combined in the area of the park, the chanting from the bullhorn turned political.Pro-monument speaker, Scott Mayo, began calling the anti-monument protesters "diabolical sociopaths,” but was received by a high-pitched whistle trying to drown him out."Where are you (Mayor) Ashton Hayward, where are you?,” Mayo asked into the bullhorn. "I was hoping you would show up today and speak with these people, but you won't show your face, will you?”Mayo then turned his efforts to calling out the Escambia County Commissioners and the Pensacola City Council members, none of whom appeared to be present at the rally. He urged them to take a stance and speak to the division in the city over the Confederate monument.Pensacola Mayor Ashton Hayward released a one-line statement later in the day through PPD commending the relative peacefulness of the event and work of police.Subscribe NowAbout Us Staff Directory Corrections Careers Accessibility Support Site Map Public Notices Our Ethical Principles Terms of Service Privacy Policy Your California Privacy Rights / Privacy Policy Do Not Sell My Info / Cookie PolicyContact Us Support Local Businesses Advertise Your Business Advertising Terms and Conditions Buy and Sell Help Center Subscriber Guide My AccountSubscribe Today Newsletters Mobile Apps Facebook Twitter E-Edition Storytellers ArchivesJob Network Cars.com Pensacola Homes Classifieds Education Moonlighting Reviewed 10Best Reach Local© 2020 www.pnj.com.
