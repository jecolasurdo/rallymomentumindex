Police arrived to direct traffic away from the intersection."They swooped in out of nowhere when the family began marching, chanting, peacefully down the street," said Theeda Murphy, a member of Community Oversight Now who was among those standing in the intersection. "That escalated the situation drastically."Murphy described a tense interaction between members of Hambrick's family "expressing themselves verbally" to Metro Nashville police officers.That's when members of her organization and the Neon Guard, a group of volunteers who provide security and work to help deescalate tension during protests, began standing between the protesters and police.Murphy said it was important the community living at John Henry Hale Apartments behind them felt protected."For the second time in a week, they're seeing this big police force descend upon their neighborhood, and they're frightened and they're scared," Murphy said.Remembering HambrickEarlier, emotion poured out of the crowd gathered to remember Hambrick, the Nashville man who was fatally shot by a police officer Thursday.They came together in Watkins Park, just a block away from the location where Hambrick, 25, was shot down.One by one, loved ones came forward with tributes for the young man they called "Dan Dan."They described a man whose first priority was taking care of his mother. A man who would do anything to help a friend in need. A man who was looking forward to a fresh start at a new job next week.A memorial banner saying "R.I.P Dan Dan" was draped over the park's jungle gym. Children stopped playing to watch solemnly as speakers talked about justice, fairness and their belief that police bias had led to Hambrick's death.Police identified the officer who shot Hambrick, who is black, as Andrew Delke, 25, who is white. The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation is probing the shooting and consulting with District Attorney Glenn Funk."We've got these little babies here. What is gonna be for them," the Rev. Andrew Mathis said to the crowd of about 70.Afterward, Mathis said he hoped the children had taken a lesson from the Saturday evening vigil: "We want them to know that they need to be aware."Hambrick's mother made an emotional statement through tears, pledging to preserve her son's legacy."I gotta fight for my son because they shot him like he was a dog," she said, her words punctuated by sobs. "My child is not a dog. He was a human being."Community members have blasted the police for failing to install body cameras or dash cams for every officer. Neither was in place before Hambrick's shooting. The TBI has instead relied on nearby surveillance footage to help piece together what happened.His death has energized calls for a civilian oversight board that would examine claims of police misconduct. Community organizers were on hand Saturday to collect signatures for a petition to add the matter to an upcoming ballot.About the shooting that killed HambrickThe TBI says video taken from nearby public housing — taken by the Metro Development and Housing Agency — shows Hambrick and two others fleeing after being approached by Delke, the police officer, in a parking lot.The three males had exited a vehicle driven by Hambrick as Delke, who is white, arrived in the parking lot. Shooting update:Video shows police shooting took place after Daniel Hambrick ran from officerDisturbed, angry, hurt:Daniel Hambrick shooting sparks strong reaction from communityMore:Nashville police officer fatally shoots man after traffic stopPolice say they were searching for a stolen vehicle in the area, had tried to stop a vehicle earlier in the night, but the driver fled instead. Hambrick and the two others turned and ran from the officer after Delke entered the parking lot, according to the TBI, and Hambrick appears to have had a dark object in his hand."The situation escalated further, for reasons still under investigation, and resulted in the officer firing his service weapon several times, striking Hambrick," the TBI says.Reach Adam Tamburin at 615-726-5986 and atamburin@tennessean.com.
