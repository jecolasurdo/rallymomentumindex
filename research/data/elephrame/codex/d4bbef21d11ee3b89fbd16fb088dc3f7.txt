LOUIS • Several dozen protesters returned on Tuesday night to the scene where many were arrested days earlier when police swept in to end a similar protest.The group stopped traffic in the middle of the intersection of Washington Avenue and Tucker Boulevard about 8 p.m.On Sept. 17, police arrested more than 120 people after a night of protests. Most of those taken into custody were arrested at Washington and Tucker and charged with "failure to disperse." But the "kettling" tactic that police used to make the mass arrests has come under criticism. Those in the intersection on Tuesday night chanted and listened to speeches as police watched, some in cars with their emergency lights activated.Among the chants were: "Whose streets? Our streets" and "Indict, convict, send those killer cops to jail. The whole damn system is guilty as hell." After about 10 minutes, the protesters moved on. They were later on Market Street headed toward the Arch.About 8:45 p.m., the crowd briefly gathered at Eighth and Clark streets outside Busch Stadium and shouted at officers in riot gear stationed there. Inside, the Cardinals were playing against the Cubs. Police tweeted that they were closing streets as the protesters marched. There were no reports of vandalism or violence. At 10 p.m., police tweeted that the protesters had left the streets and no arrests had been made. Demonstrators have exited roadway. No arrests made tonight as demonstrators marched through Downtown. #STLVerdict— St. Louis, MO Police (@SLMPD) September 27, 2017 The protesters had gathered earlier at Kiener Plaza downtown and marched around Ballpark Village and the stadium before heading north on Broadway.At one point, when the protesters were on Clark Street, police tweeted that the group had been ordered to disperse and told them how to leave. But the protesters then moved on. Two DOJ officials trailing the parade. Said they were doing confidential work pursuant to Civil Rights Act. Game me a DC contact. Left a msg— Jeremy Kohler (@jeremykohler) September 27, 2017 Two men trailed the protest for much of the night; one of them confirmed he was with the Department of Justice but his purpose was confidential under the Civil Rights Act. He referred a reporter to a DOJ official in Washington who could not be reached. The protests marked the 12th day that people have gathered in protest of the acquittal of former St. Louis police officer Jason Stockley in the fatal shooting of drug suspect Anthony Lamar Smith following a high-speed chase. 0 comments Law and order St. Louis-area serial killers Law and order Salary information Law and order 2020 homicide map Shake off your afternoon slump with the oft-shared and offbeat news of the day, hand-brewed by our online news editor, Mandy St. Amand.
