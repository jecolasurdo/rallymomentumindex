Demonstrators were seen being led off in handcuffs amid the march from Columbus Circle to Times Square Wednesday night following the shooting death of Stephon Clark, an unarmed 22-year-old shot to death by police in his grandparents' backyard on March 18. Police say at least 11 people were detained. It was not immediately clear what charges they could face.

They have not said whether that officer was injured. Manhattan's protest came the same day Clark's family and friends gathered for a wake for the 22-year-old, who was shot by police responding to a report of someone car windows. Police say they believe Clark was the suspect and he ran when a police helicopter responded, then did not obey officers' orders. Police say they thought Clark was holding a gun when he moved toward them, but he was found only with a cellphone. Protests in Sacramento have been held almost daily since then, and marchers have twice blocked fans from entering the NBA arena downtown for Sacramento Kings games. The police, the Kings and Steinberg's office met Wednesday to discuss security ahead of Thursday night's game. Sgt. Vince Chandler said officers would be ready to respond in protective gear, according to The Sacramento Bee. On Wednesday, about 50 protesters took over the intersection near the Sacramento district attorney's office as part of a protest organized by the local Black Lives Matter chapter to urge the district attorney to file charges against the officers. They disrupted midtown rush hour traffic as they marched through the streets. Latavia Ross, pushing her 2-year-old son Jayceon Hurts in a stroller, said she attended the protest because she thinks it's good for the community to come together to end to gun violence.
