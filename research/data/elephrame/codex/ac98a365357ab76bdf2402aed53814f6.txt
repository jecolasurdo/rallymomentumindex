The former University of Cincinnati police officer faced murder and voluntary manslaughter charges for the July 2015 shooting death of DuBose, an unarmed black motorist. Tensing pulled over DuBose in Mount Auburn for a missing front license plate.The charges are expected to be formally dismissed Monday morning in the courtroom of Judge Leslie Ghiz, who presided over the second trial. It, like the first, ended with the jury unable to reach a unanimous decision."There is time for Deters to change his mind on this," Brian Taylor, a leader of the local Black Lives Matter organization, said shortly before 5 p.m. Saturday at Fountain Square. "Two trials took place, and neither sought justice. Jurors were relatives of police officers and said on questionnaires that some ethnicities were more violent than others. That is systemic racism to the core. We want a federal investigation."If Deters does dismiss the charges, Tensing will be a free man. Deters said Tuesday that he has turned over trial materials to federal prosecutors, who could try Tensing on civil rights charges.Still, Tensing supporters plan to mark the dismissal of charges. On Monday at 6 p.m., they will hold a rally beginning at Sawyer Point and march across the Purple People Bridge. Many will wear T-shirts reading #TENSINGPROUD.Alexander Shelton, second from right, and Aubrey DuBose, far right, march along Freedom Way during a Countdown to Conviction Coalition rally for justice for Aubrey's brother Sam DuBose Saturday, July 22, 2017.

They plan to line the railings of the pedestrian bridge, they said, "to show opposition to the pro-killer cop march. ... Under no circumstances can this show of support for inherently racist institutions go unopposed."Taylor addressed the planning of the pro-Tensing rally at Fountain Square."We need to be here today and we need to be out Monday to be reactive to what that racist hashtag represents," he said to loud cheers.Demonstrators march on Joe Nuxhall Way during a Countdown to Conviction Coalition rally for justice for Sam DuBose Saturday, July 22, 2017.

(Photo: The Enquirer/Cara Owsley)Words on Saturday were as hot as the weather."We're not done fighting," Aubrey DuBose, Sam DuBose's younger brother, said through a bullhorn at the Tyler Davidson Fountain. "We're going to take it to the federal level. We got a murdering cop walking our streets. We got to go hard. We got to do it peacefully."Demonstrators filed out of the square east on Fifth Street before turning south on Walnut Street. As they chanted and moved south of Fourth Street, they stopped in the street to block traffic headed to Great American Ballpark. Cincinnati police officers emerged from two unmarked vehicles to redirect traffic west on Fourth.Collected chants of protesters echoed between tall buildings."Retry, convict, send Ray Tensing to jail. The whole damn system is guilty as hell." Marchers turned east onto Second Street, south onto Main in front of the ballpark and then west onto Freedom Way. Police kept their distance, unlike two weeks ago in Over-the-Rhine when an officer from a bike patrol pinned a female demonstrator against a wall with his bicycle.Demonstrators, a crowd of almost equal numbers white people and African-Americans, spread out on the sidewalk along Freedom Way between Main and Walnut streets.They chanted loudly."Black lives matter." Ten. Twenty, almost thirty times.Then, "If we don't get no justice, then you don't get no peace."A young white man in a Reds cap shot video of the demonstration from a sidewalk table at Holy Grail sports bar.He declined to provide his name, but said, "It is what it is."Another young white man, wearing a blue University of Kentucky basketball T-shirt, also declined to give his name, but said, "Why are they here? Did that guy live around here or something?"As they took to the middle of the street and gathered in a circle in front of an unmarked police SUV, demonstrators chanted again.From an open apartment window above the BurgerFi restaurant, a white woman flipped both of her middle fingers at demonstrators. Through an adjacent window, a shirtless man stuck out a red cardboard sign reading, "Make America Great Again."Cincinnati Vice Mayor David Mann, standing among demonstrators at Fountain Square, tried to provide more light than heat on the steamy afternoon."I want to be present and show my concern where we are and where we're headed as a country," said Mann, a lawyer. "The issue for this country is we need to have juries who will look at the facts and not be influenced by race. All of us, if we see that a police officer, regardless of color, is guilty of misconduct, we have to say so."CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORERead or Share this story: https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/2017/07/23/protesters-continue-drumbeat-against-tensing/502316001/Find JobsShare your feedback to help improve our site experience!
