Share Share Tweet Mail Print The aftermath of the hate speech discovered Tuesday morning on EMU's campus was immediate. Students gathered at the scene of the incident. There were some students that voiced and held signs to display their frustration. Throughout the day faculty, students and other campus patrons visited the scene to get more information, and to show their support against the negative message sprayed on the wall. "I am highly upset about the actions that took place on this wall. I want answers. I want to know what EMU is going to do outside of just removing the writing. These are the type of hate crimes we are just sick of. I want to know how is EMU going to make me feel comfortable to be at this institution,” said Zachary Badger-House, EMU student, Media Studies and Journalism major. Students both directly and indirectly affected were angered, saddened and concerned on Tuesday afternoon after hearing of the message that had been washed off of the King Hall wall early Tuesday. "We need answers! The people in power know how we feel, so at this point it doesn't matter who did it, or if there is a reward for information regarding this incident. What matters is the fact that this happened on our campus, and that covering it up was the only solution they could think of at the time. It isn't enough. It's one thing for these actions to happen somewhere in the world, but it is happening right here on our campus,” said Armani Davis, EMU student, Social Work major. Despite the message no longer being on the wall the change in the campus climate is imminent. Students of color and allies began to assemble throughout campus, rally, and converse. Students posted signs saying "Black Lives Matter” in the elevators of Pray Harrold; an EMU educational building. "It pains me to see oppressed groups being even further oppressed. EMU is a large diverse campus, and yet still are standing here demanding answers,” said Marwah Baidoun, Social Work major. Eastern Michigan University issued a statement following the incident. The heart of the message, "The University condemns this act in the strongest of terms and we stand strong in our determination to identify the individual or individuals responsible, and then beyond this to address the broader issues in our community that such an action highlights.” Share Related Stories Depot Town Update: Sidetrack Bar and Grill dine-in options now available By Austin Elliott Symposium: Political Experience - Does it matter?
