McCulloch, who has been urged to step aside in the case of a white police officer from Ferguson who shot and killed Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, in August.Despite a cold, steady rain, hundreds of demonstrators gripped umbrellas and marched through the streets of Clayton, the seat of St. Louis County. The racially mixed group of protesters, guided by volunteers in fluorescent vests, chanted the slogans that became constants on Ferguson's streets after Mr. Brown's death, including "Hands up! Don't shoot!”"We're going to keep on until they do listen,” said Keith Jackson, 50, of Ferguson. "It may fall on deaf ears, but people are listening.”ImageIn a cold, steady rain, the police watched as the demonstrators marched through the streets of the county seat city of Clayton.Credit...Whitney Curtis for The New York TimesPolice officers closed streets to accommodate the demonstration and did not interfere.Late Friday, hundreds of people marched in Ferguson, where demonstrators carried a mirrored coffin, which they said represented all the victims of police brutality. The protesters eventually amassed at the Ferguson Police Department, where they stood face to face, in some instances, with officers clad in riot gear.The organized rallies began at a moment when the St. Louis metropolitan area again found itself in the midst of racial turmoil, after a white off-duty St. Louis police officer killed a black teenager in the city's Shaw neighborhood on Wednesday night. The police have said the teenager, Vonderrit Myers Jr., opened fire on the unidentified officer, but Mr. Myers's family has insisted that he was unarmed.Supporters of Mr. Myers, 18, have also questioned why the officer, who was driving through the area while working a detail for a private security firm, ever sought to interact with Mr. Myers and two other black men, who they said were merely standing along the street.Those anxieties helped to provoke protests in St. Louis on Wednesday and Thursday nights. Demonstrators marched through the streets and often blocked traffic, and the authorities said both rounds of protests led to property damage. During Thursday's demonstration, when eight people were arrested and a police officer was injured, officers used pepper spray to control the crowds.ImageProtesters and police officers faced off in and around the Shaw neighborhood in St. Louis on Thursday night.Credit...Whitney Curtis for The New York TimesMr. Brown's parents on Friday asked protesters to remain peaceful throughout the weekend."We understand firsthand the powerless frustration felt by people of all walks of life regarding their interactions with law enforcement,” Michael Brown Sr. and Lesley McSpadden said in a statement released by their lawyers. "And for that reason, as Michael Brown's parents, we ask that those coming to show support for our son do so within the law.”The weekend's organizers were preparing for arrests of demonstrators. On one Twitter page, demonstrators were advised to bring posters, dress in warm clothes and to write on their arms a phone number they could call for assistance if they were jailed."Trust us,” an online post said. "You will need it.”Many of the rank-and-file demonstrators here said they would not hesitate to face arrest."If you don't stand for something, you'll fall for anything,” said Jerron Faulk, 30, who traveled from North Carolina to join the protests. "We're out here with a purpose. We're out here with a cause. It's a lot bigger than actually spending a night in jail.”ImageA police officer in front of a shattered door at a drugstore in St. Louis, where protesters gathered after a vigil for Vonderrit D.

With weather forecasters predicting rain showers throughout the weekend, it was unclear whether turnout would be diminished.Although public demonstrations are on the calendar through Monday — a major march through St. Louis's downtown area is planned for Saturday morning — organizers have also scheduled an array of seminars and panel discussions at churches, a coffeehouse and a law school.Even in their earliest hours on Friday, the demonstrations here were attracting people who had not previously marched in Missouri in the aftermath of Mr. Brown's death."It means that I don't have to take accounts from anybody else,” said Shakia Pennix, a graduate student at Georgia State University in Atlanta. "I actually see what's going on, see the people, feel the energy, see what the cops are doing.”That personal experience, she said, would most likely deepen her passion."Everybody's just fighting and just trying to show that we're willing to take our time and sacrifice money, school, whatever to show that we're serious,” she said. "We're not taking it anymore.”AdvertisementContinue reading the main storySite IndexSite Information Navigation© 2020 The New York Times CompanyNYTCoContact UsWork with usAdvertiseT Brand StudioYour Ad ChoicesPrivacyTerms of ServiceTerms of SaleSite MapHelpSubscriptions
