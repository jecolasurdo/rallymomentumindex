Tidewater Review Breaking News Videos Feb 22, 2016 | 10:34 AM Each location on the flier has a hashtag that reads "ShutDown" with a major street name. Newport News had the hashtag "#ShutDownJefferson," and Hampton had "#ShutDownMercury." Protesters in Newport News started gathering just after 7 p.m. in the Rouse Tower parking lot, off the corner of Jefferson Avenue and Mercury Boulevard, before they headed out to the streets. The group of at least 150 men, women and children made circles around that intersection before heading northbound on Jefferson yelling, "Don't shoot, hands up," eventually making it to the front door of the Newport News Police Department. Newport News Police had blocked off Jefferson and Mercury for several blocks in each direction until at least 9:50 p.m. In Hampton, marches caused traffic backups on Mercury and in several area parking lots. The protest in Hampton took place on Mercury Boulevard, near the K-Mart east of Armistead Road. Hundreds of protesters shut down Mercury for just over a half-hour Sunday night, between 7:57 and about 8:35. Marchers began near the K-Mart at Seldendale Drive and marched about a quarter mile to the west, then turned around and walked the other direction. They held signs and placards, chanting, "No justice, no peace," and "Hands up, don't shoot." Hampton Police Chief Terry Sult and Mayor Donnie Tuck stood together to watch the march, saying that police worked with organizers to allow them the proscribed route. "They're exercising their First Amendment rights," Sult said. "We give them a little bit of the road time, what harm is there in that? We all want consistent and fair treatment for everybody." "What we try to do is work with them, and let them exercise their rights, and be respectful with what kind of a disruption we are doing. We are not going to allow a major disruption. This is a minor disruption. We had a traffic plan in place, no different than having an accident that blocks the street," he said. Sult said that the police could have prevented the marcher from blocking Mercury. "But at the end of the day, what would happen if I put a field force out here and pushed them off the street?," he said. "Is that the message we want to send, that that's the kind of city we are? Now, we are ready to do something if it turned disruptive, violent, that type of thing, but at the end of the day these are peaceful folks that are frustrated and have a message to send. And we need listen. That's what this is really about." Advertisement As he spoke, a protester came over to shake Sult's hand and said, "I'm sorry it had to come to this," thanked the officers for their service said to "stay safe out here." Sult told the man he understood the reason for the protest, that it's all about fairness. Later, he said that that man was one of about "10 or 12" people who had expressed similar sentiments. He said officers are out here "having a real positive, constructive, healthy dialogue with the folks here who have concerns," and "the only way we are going to resolve the complex issues that we have is up-close and in-personal conversation." "I was aware that it was going to happen, and I'm comfortable with how it was handled," said Hampton Mayor Donnie Tuck. "I don't know if there was any alternative." "The intent on the march was to shut down, and with this spirit of cooperation we didn't allow that fully to take place," Tuck said. "There wasn't just an effort where they just blocked the street and didn't allow any traffic to pass....They actually marched, with police assisting them. I think it was determined how far they would go, and then they would turn around and come back. And those are all positive things." He agreed with Sult that it was best to allow the marchers rather than forcing people out. If the people simply stood in the street, Tuck said, "police would have been forced to try to move them out. And then the event would have escalated, and you would not have had the same positive outcome." If there was an emergency and someone needed to get through, Tuck said, "I think we would make accommodations for that." Sheila Ellis, 46, of Newport News, prayed at the police headquarters on Jefferson Avenue, and then prayed at the intersection of Jefferson Avenue and Mercury Boulevard when the march moved there. "I just stayed silent, sitting there in prayer," she said. "I had my eyes closed and I had faith that I was protected. I had one young man stop and pray with me. Put his hand on my head for a while. And everyone has gone home, so my prayer was answered." The Jefferson Avenue rally was organized by Latonya "Abys" Wallace after leaders for BlackLivesMatter757 asked her to set it up. Wallace is the president of a local organization called Abu Unity Foundation, which promotes mentoring children and teenagers. "It's no 'F the police' out here, we don't want that," Wallace said in an interview. "We just want justice for our black people." She added, "You have to put yourself in our shoes," Wallace said. "Our men are dying from traffic stops; from a taillight being out; from (police) giving an order, you reaching for your license and you getting shot. They say, 'comply and you won't die.' We comply and we still die." Wallace told the group of protesters before they started walking that police need to be accountable and that cops that are truly "good" should be calling out the "bad" cops. As protesters walked, cars on southbound Jefferson honked with them, sometimes in unison to their chanting. Protesters made it to Newport News Police Department on Jefferson Avenue around 8:30 p.m. and stood on the cement perimeter on its lawn yelling, "No justice, no peace." They briefly blocked Jefferson Avenue right outside the department and continued to chant — some standing face to face with officers monitoring the road. Interactions between officers and protesters were amicable. Some protesters walked up to officers to shake their hands. The group then assembled in front of the police department and chanted before Wallace quieted the group down. She told the group that moving forward, they must hold elected officials accountable. Southeast Community activist Angela Harris discussed why the phrase "black lives matter" is important. Advertisement "Yes, white lives matter. All lives matter, but white people are not being oppressed like black people," Harris said. Tracy Sigler, a Newport News resident, was one of the hundred-plus protesters and brought her 9-year-old daughter, Mahdelin, to the protest in hopes of shaping her for the future. Her daughter had a board that read "Jesus Lives" around her chest. "She's going to inherit all of this that we live in," Sigler said. "If we don't speak up, it's going to be repeated." A majority of the protesters were black, but a handful of people of other races attended. Rebecca Dillow, a white Newport News resident, said she came out because she didn't want to stay quiet. "I'm a believer of justice," Dillow said. "As a white person, I can't sit by and watch this happen." The protest in Newport News ended about 9:30 p.m. Protest Black Lives Matter was held this afternoon at Jefferson Ave. and Mercury Blvd. in Newport News with about 1000 people attending the march. They later walked up Jefferson Ave. to the Newport News Police Station. Prayer service People also gathered at Warwick United Methodist Church in Denbigh earlier on Sunday night for a prayer service that called for the safety of local law enforcement. The Rev. Bert Cloud told parishioners that they were in "a safe place." "When the world is turned upside down ... when we live in fear and anxiety, to whom else do we turn but to the Lord? That's why we are here tonight," Cloud said.
