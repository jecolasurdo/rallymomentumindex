Activists, several wearing masks, waved placards and chanted "Black Lives Matter” and "no justice, no peace” as the demonstration got under way. Other signs read: "UK aren't innocent”. Crowds began to build in Hyde Park some three hours before the start of the protest. Since the rally at Speakers' Corner, thousands have taken to London's streets and marched on Parliament Square. Traffic was blocked in certain areas as some climbed on phone boxes and sculptures with megaphones to whip up loud chants of "silence is violence" and "say his name, George Floyd".​ Read more Thousands to descend on Hyde Park for George Floyd protest- LIVE As groups gathered just after noon, social distancing became problematic due to sheer numbers.
