The four and a half minutes that the protesters spent blocking the street was meant to parallel the four and a half hours that Michael Brown's body laid in the streets of Ferguson, Missouri, according to the protesters. "Our goal during these four and a half minutes, and beyond, is to create moments of public reflection on the fact that Black people are treated with a disregard for their life. The mistreatment, murder, and violence must cease at once." according to a statement from Julius Jones, who led the protest. "Our public discourse is currently dominated by backlash. Public reaction to the recent protests on Interstate 93, are intense, harsh, and pointing to a larger problem. Today we embody the idea that if your neighbor is crying "I can't breathe”, you should listen, answer that call to action, and work until we are all free. If your neighbor is imprisoned, chances are that you share the same fate, or soon will. We answer the call, and ask Worcester to join us in saying 'Black Lives Matter'. We protest as a community comprised of people from all walks of life, all manner of political stances, and ethnic backgrounds. We come together, beyond our differences, to stand in solidarity, holding a new vision of the United States, and the world.” The Massachusetts State Police tweeted about the incident, no delays were reported.
