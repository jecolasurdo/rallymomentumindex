Protesters lay in front of the revolving door and glass walls of the facade at headquarters. Lamon Reccord, an activist who knew O'Neal, was the first to lie down at the feet of officers standing in a row in front of the glass and called for a moment of silence for O'Neal. Others quickly followed. Advertisement Familiar chants of "hands up, don't shoot" and "CPD, KKK, how many Pauls are you going to kill today?" rang through the air. As people got up off the ground, many of them got up close to officers. Desirea Barnes, 48, who lives near police headquarters, yelled "murderers" at the officers who stood there. Advertisement "They're killing down our kids, they're killing down our brothers, our fathers, our mothers, they're killing us," she said. Reccord held a microphone up to officers, telling them to answer him about what they think about the killing. "We don't kill y'all, but y'all kill us," he said to them. As protesters began to get louder and more agitated, officers with bikes walked in between protesters and police, forming a barrier with their bicycles. For some, this only made them angrier. For others, it was an opportunity to have a larger audience. "I want you to know that you could be the next thing because you don't wear your uniform 24/7 and they don't care, they don't see, they don't wait for you to pull out your wallet and check and see if you're an officer before they kill you," said Jamela Carrell, 32, of Chicago Heights. "So you know, just know, we here for y'all, too, and we love y'all and we fighting for y'all when y'all can't fight for ya'll selves." Just before 9:30 p.m., protesters began to leave the area to go to another protest near where O'Neal was shot.

That protest had continued since the evening. By about 10 p.m. police and protesters had shut down the intersection of 71st Street and Jeffery Boulevard, not far from where O'Neal was shot. "We stopped the train, we stopped the buses, we stopped the traffic," said the Rev. Jedidiah Brown, an activist who lives in the area. "This is epic. There's no words to describe it."

Having them all in the same space, largely peaceful, is remarkable, he said. There were brief scuffles, including a chaotic incident outside a Walgreen's store. "They know why they're here," Brown said. "(The scuffles are) expected, but they're easily squashed. We all feel this pain the same way."
