Moore who attended the event, carried a casket with some other Jefferson County Public School students with the names of people killed by the police."This is happening. This is real," Muhammad said. "People are being murdered by people who are sworn to protect us."3:30 p.m. — One protester, Carmen Jones, met with Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer in the morning."We don't want parks," Jones told The Courier Journal.

"I really think people are going to stay dug in until he (Hankison) gets charged.”11:30 a.m. — Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced that the Louisville Metro Police Department will fire Officer Brett Hankison, one of three LMPD officers to fire their weapons on March 13 at Taylor's apartment, with Taylor getting fatally struck. 10:15 a.m. — About 30 minutes after Schroeder's media briefing ended, members of the Louisville Metro Kentucky State Chapter of the National Action Network, a civil rights organization founded by the Rev. Al Sharpton, stood outside Metro Hall and held signs that said "Justice for Breonna Taylor and Kenneth Walker.”The group was also joined by members of the National Action Network's Greater Washington D.C. chapter, including its president, Nia 2X."It is immoral to take this long to bring charges” against the officers involved in Taylor's death, 2X said.Kathleen Parks, president of the Louisville chapter, called Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron an "eloquent orator,” but in response to his Thursday remarks about not setting a timetable in the investigation into the officers who shot Taylor, Parks said "we need a timeline.”"Why not?” she said, addressing Cameron's refusal to say when his office will conclude its investigation.The members also demanded that Fischer fire the three officers who fired their weapons inside Taylor's apartment and release records that attorneys for Taylor's family have requested from the city and LMPD as part of a lawsuit."Mayor Fischer, get your knee off our necks,” Parks said.9:30 a.m. — Interim Louisville Police Chief Robert Schroeder said 56 people were arrested during the overnight protests and five vehicles were towed. He said officers found "several pieces of pipe and other materials that could be used to make pipe bombs" in their search of Jefferson Square Park, prompting a response from the bomb squad. The park was cleared for public safety because bottles were being thrown and because of the fireworks, he said. It was reopened to protesters at approximately 5 a.m., he said."We continue to value the voices of those who come to peacefully protest and demonstrate their feelings, but we simply cannot tolerate the destruction we saw last night, the violence we saw last night," he said.There were several fires in the area, including a large dumpster fire at Fifth and Liberty streets and a tree that was set on fire at Grinstead and Seminary, Schroeder said.People who were peaceful and who "wanted to disperse were given plenty of time to disperse," Schroeder said.

Neither Should Mitch."Others held signs with messages such as, "No Justice No Sleep," "Look Us In The Eyes" and "Wake Up Mitch."Outside McConnell's house, speakers are taking turns expressing their concerns, anger and frustration as it relates to police brutality and systemic racism."When we say 'I can't breathe,' what we're really saying is 'I can't be.' I can't be in a system like this," one woman said. "I can't live, I can't grow into the human being the person that I meant to be, because of the weight of this."A second speaker added: "Not only are we wide awake to the problems that we face, but we're also wide awake to the solutions that we need. We're not here to just complain on the internet. We're here to get the solutions we need."As the group took a moment of silence for those who have died, a man who lives nearby walked up demanding to know what several protesters were writing down."We don't come to your house,” the man said before walking away.Another neighbor stopped to stand with the protesters while she was walking by, telling them, "Thank you all.”3:30 a.m. — LMPD spokeswoman Jessie Halladay released an emailed statement that said Real Time Crime Center cameras captured people "hurling the fireworks or explosives at Metro Hall and the Hall of Justice."LMPD officers, including the department's Special Response Team, gave several orders for people to disperse and asked protesters to clear Jefferson Square Park "temporarily so they could walk through and do a safety check, which protesters agreed to do."At the time of Halladay's email just after 3:30 a.m., LMPD had towed at least three cars and made at least eight arrests, the spokeswoman said."Just after 2:45 a.m., officers monitoring the situation at the park reported having bottles thrown at them.

"They got comfortable," he said. "The police got comfortable. It went from them being comfortable, to them being agitated. They're stopping our marches, started saying the cars couldn't go. Okay, so we're back to blocking streets, back to square one, back to the drawing board.”Fixit said he assumes he'll see police in riot gear again this week."And they should expect to see way more people come outside,” he said.

Assistant Chief of Police LaVita Chavous has said they can be used to "block back chemicals into police's faces or blow back the gas, chemicals that we may use in an effort so that they can continue to be out there protesting and causing problems."James said Thursday he did not like that explanation, and that police officers should have approached people with leaf blowers, not fire tear gas on the crowd.Overall, James said that the police department's lack of leadership has led to a public distrust in the law enforcement officers. He also said the lack of body cameras and answers from police in the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in her own home on March 13 has been especially frustrating.June 3• 11:10 p.m — Protesters marched down Broadway once again Wednesday night after 11 p.m. to express anger over the Breonna Taylor and David McAtee, who were shot and killed by law enforcement officials in Louisville.Another group of protesters had marched through the Highlands.

He's watched the video released by police but questioned the lack of body camera footage and said it didn't seem like McAtee -- "The man fed the cops for free," Harrington said.He was taken by surprise at the size and consistency of the groups who have gathered on Louisville's streets over the past week. "It's patently obvious to everybody locally, nationally and internationally that the way our criminal justice system interacts with black communities is broken,” he said. "And personally I think it's by design. It's designed to overcriminalize, to overpolice black communities. And you can only overpolice, harass people to a point. There comes a breaking point.”Sporting a 2007 Russel neighborhood Jazz Festival T-shirt, Harrington pointed to the Kroger across the street.
