"The excessive action has shocked the nation."Police cars and slowed traffic trailed the protesters who walked on Detroit Avenue for about an hour.Protests last week caused headaches for downtown commuters.State Representative Nickie Antonio, who represents the area around the Cudell Recreation Center, spoke to protesters Friday and called for careful examination of police training."The people of Cleveland are looking for answers," she said.Tamir was shot by a rookie police officer Nov. 22 outside the Cudell Recreation Center. A bystander called 9-1-1 and reported that someone was at the park with a gun.Cleveland police sped a cruiser to the pavilion where Tamir stood, and shot him within two seconds. The boy was carrying an airsoft replica pistol.A scathing Department of Justice report released last week chastised a slew of Cleveland law enforcement tactics, including the fact that police are often quick to draw their weapons instead of using methods to de-escalate potential threats.Tamir's mother, Samaria Rice, is expected to join the Rev. Al Sharpton and the families of Michael Brown, Eric Garner and Trayvon Martin Saturday in Washington D.C. to lead a march against police brutality and excessive force.Note to readers: if you purchase something through one of our affiliate links we may earn a commission.DisclaimerRegistration on or use of this site constitutes acceptance of our User Agreement, Privacy Policy and Cookie Statement, and Your California Privacy Rights (each updated 1/1/20).© 2020 Advance Local Media LLC.
