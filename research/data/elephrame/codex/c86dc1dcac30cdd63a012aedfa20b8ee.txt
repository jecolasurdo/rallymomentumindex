Here are the players who protested in Week 5:Denver Broncos: Linebacker Brandon Marshall took a knee for the national anthem before Sunday's Broncos-Falcons game in Denver. It is the fifth consecutive game Marshall has gone to one knee during the anthem. -- Jeff LegwoldSan Diego Chargers: Offensive linemen Joe Barksdale, D.J. Fluker, Chris Hairston and Tyreek Burwell and linebacker Joshua Perry once again raised their fists during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racial oppression before Sunday's game against the Raiders. -- Eric D. WilliamsOakland Raiders: For the third week in a row, linebackers Bruce Irvin and Malcolm Smith raised a right fist at the end of the national anthem. -- Paul GutierrezLos Angeles Rams: Defensive end Robert Quinn raised his right fist during the national anthem before the Rams' game against the Bills on Sunday. He has been doing it since Week 1. -- Alden GonzalezPhiladelphia Eagles: Eagles safety Malcolm Jenkins and cornerback Ron Brooks each raised a fist above their heads during the playing of the anthem before the start of Eagles-Lions game. Both players have done the same in recent weeks. -- Tim McManusTennessee Titans: Tennessee defenders Jason McCourty, Jurrell Casey, DaQuan Jones and Wesley Woodyard raised fists after the conclusion of the anthem at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. Each has participated in the same gesture this season. -- Paul KuharskyWashington Redskins: Cornerback Greg Toler and tight end Niles Paul locked arms during the anthem before the Redskins' game in Baltimore. Both players were among the Redskins to raise their fists during the anthem in recent weeks. -- John KeimMiami Dolphins: Wide receiver Kenny Stills and running back Arian Foster, who is inactive, kneeled for the anthem before the Dolphins' game against the Titans. Foster said recently the main purpose of their demonstration is to create a healthy dialogue on systemic racial issues such as education, the prison system and police brutality toward minorities. In turn, Foster added, productive conversations could help lead to change. "It's just so easy to hate," he said. "If you're proclaiming to be a true American, freedom runs in our bloodlines, right? It's supposed to. If somebody is telling you they don't feel like they're free, why wouldn't you listen to them?" -- ESPN.com staffSan Francisco 49ers: Quarterback Colin Kaepernick, safety Eric Reid and linebacker Eli Harold again knelt in protest of racial inequality and oppression during the anthem before Thursday night's game against Arizona. Safeties Jaquiski Tartt and Antoine Bethea, cornerbacks Keith Reaser and Rashard Robinson and running back Mike Davis again held up their right fists. -- Nick Wagoner FacebookTwitterFacebook MessengerEmail
